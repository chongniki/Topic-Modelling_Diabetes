8626635|t|Effects of diabetes mellitus on hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 decrease albumin gene transcription.
8626635|a|We have previously reported that albumin gene transcription is reduced in diabetes mellitus (DM). The present study explored the mechanism by which albumin gene transcription is down-regulated in DM. Deletional studies and displacement of factors binding to site B of the albumin promoter indicated that the repressive effects of DM are mediated by nuclear factors binding to this site. Since hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) activates albumin promoter activity and is the predominant factor binding to site B, we examined HNF1. The abundance and binding activity of HNF1 were reduced in hepatonuclear extracts from diabetic compared to control rats. However, HNF1 mRNA levels were unchanged, suggesting that the effect of DM on HNF1 is at the post-transcriptional level. Extracts from diabetic animals also contained another protein, distinct from HNF1 and vHNF1, which bound to site B in gel retardation studies. In summary, our studies demonstrate that the reduced abundance and binding activity of HNF1 correlates with decreased albumin gene transcription in DM.

8945470|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3)
8945470|a|The disease non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose resulting from a relative deficiency of insulin. It affects about 2% of the world's population and treatment of diabetes and its complications are an increasing health-care burden. Genetic factors are important in the aetiology of NIDDM, and linkage studies are starting to localize some of the genes that influence the development of this disorder. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a single-gene disorder responsible for 2-5% of NIDDM, is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and an age of onset of 25 years or younger. MODY genes have been localized to chromosomes 7, 12 and 20 (refs 5, 7, 8) and clinical studies indicate that mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal patterns of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The gene on chromosome 7 (MODY2) encodes the glycolytic enzyme glucokinases which plays a key role in generating the metabolic signal for insulin secretion and in integrating hepatic glucose uptake. Here we show that subjects with the MODY3-form of NIDDM have mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha, which is encoded by the gene TCF1). HNF-1alpha is a transcription factor that helps in the tissue-specific regulation of the expression of several liver genes and also functions as a weak transactivator of the rat insulin-I gene.

8945471|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha gene in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1)
8945471|a|The disease maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic form of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), characterized by early onset, usually before 25 years of age and often in adolescence or childhood, and by autosomal dominant inheritance. It has been estimated that 2-5% of patients with NIDDM may have this form of diabetes mellitus. Clinical studies have shown that prediabetic MODY subjects have normal insulin sensitivity but suffer from a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting that pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction rather than insulin resistance is the primary defect in this disorder. Linkage studies have localized the genes that are mutated in MODY on human chromosomes 20 (MODY1), 7 (MODY2) and 12 (MODY3), with MODY2 and MODY3 being allelic with the genes encoding glucokinase, a key regulator of insulin secretion, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), a transcription factor involved in tissue-specific regulation of liver genes but also expressed in pancreatic islets, insulinoma cells and other tissues. Here we show that MODY1 is the gene encoding HNF-4alpha (gene symbol, TCF14), a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and an upstream regulator of HNF-1alpha expression.

9032114|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in MODY and early-onset NIDDM: evidence for a mutational hotspot in exon 4.
9032114|a|We have recently shown that mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha are the cause of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). Here, we report the exon-intron organization and partial sequence of the human HNF-1alpha gene. In addition, we have screened the ten exons and flanking introns of this gene for mutations in a group of 25 unrelated white subjects from Germany who presented with NIDDM before 35 years of age and had a first-degree relative with NIDDM. Mutations were identified in nine of these individuals, suggesting that mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are a common cause of diabetes in German subjects with early-onset NIDDM and a family history of diabetes. Thus, screening for mutations in this gene may be indicated in subjects with early-onset NIDDM. Interestingly, three of the nine mutations occurred at the same site in exon 4 with insertion of a C in a polyC tract, centered around codon 290 (designated Pro291fsinsC), thereby resulting in a frameshift during translation and premature termination. Analyses of linked DNA polymorphisms in the HNF-1alpha gene indicated that the Pro291fsinsC mutation was present on a different haplotype in each subject, implying that the polyC tract represents a mutational hot spot. We have also identified the mutation in the HNF-1alpha gene in the Jutland pedigree, one of the original MODY pedigrees reported in the literature, as being a T--&gt;G substitution in codon 241, resulting in the replacement of a conserved Cys by Gly (C241G). The information on the sequence of the HNF-1alpha gene and its promoter region will facilitate the search for mutations in other subjects and studies of the role of the gene in determining normal beta-cell functions.

9075818|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene are a common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young in the U.K.
9075818|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene have recently been shown to cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We have examined 15 U.K. MODY families for mutations in the coding region of the HNF-1alpha gene. Eight different mutations, three frameshift (P291fsinsC, P379fsdelCT, and A443fsdelCA) and five missense mutations (P129T, R131W, R159W, P519L, and T620I), were identified in eleven families (73%). The previously reported mutation P291fsinsC was found in four pedigrees. A screen of a further 32 probands with early onset (&lt;40 years of age) NIDDM showed the mutation in two additional families. This common mutation was present on at least three different haplotypes, suggesting that its high frequency is due to recurrent mutation rather than a founder effect. We have demonstrated that mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are a common cause of MODY in U.K. families and result in early onset NIDDM with a progressive clinical course. Mutation-based genetic counseling can now be considered for the majority of patients with MODY.

9075819|t|Novel MODY3 mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene: evidence for a hyperexcitability of pancreatic beta-cells to intravenous secretagogues in a glucose-tolerant carrier of a P447L mutation.
9075819|a|One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) results from mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene, located on chromosome 12q24.2. The primary objective of the present study was to search for genetic variation in the HNF-1alpha gene in nine nonrelated Danish Caucasian subjects with MODY. Direct sequencing of the coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-1alpha gene revealed 2 novel and 1 previously reported missense mutations and 2 novel frameshift mutations in five of nine MODY subjects. These five mutations were found in neither 84 NIDDM patients nor 84 control subjects. One glucose-tolerant lean male with a P447L missense mutation, which in his relatives caused MODY, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a tolbutamide modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and a glucagon test to examine for a possible early beta-cell abnormality. He had a low insulin secretion rate during an OGTT, but a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell response after intravenous glucose and a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in beta-cell response after either intravenous tolbutamide or intravenous glucagon loads. In conclusion, 1) mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene are common in Danish Caucasian MODY patients, and 2) early stages in the pathogenesis of MODY3 caused by the P447L mutation may be characterized by a hyperexcitability of beta-cells to intravenous secretagogues.

9097962|t|Identification of nine novel mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha gene associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3).
9097962|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the two functionally related transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4alpha) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1alpha) are associated with the MODY1 and MODY3 forms of diabetes respectively, whereas mutations in the enzyme glucokinase are the cause of the MODY2 form. We have examined 10 unrelated Caucasian families in which MODY/NIDDM co-segregated with markers for MODY3 for mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene (TCF1). Ten different mutations were observed in these families, all of which co-segregated with diabetes. There were no obvious relationships between the nature of the mutations observed (i.e. frameshift, nonsense, or missense) or their location in the gene with clinical features of diabetes (age at onset, severity) in these families. The mechanisms by which mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene cause diabetes mellitus are unclear but might include abnormal pancreatic islet development during foetal life thereby limiting their later function, as well as impaired transcriptional regulation of genes that play a key role in normal pancreatic beta cell function.

9112026|t|Genetic variation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene in Danish Caucasians with late-onset NIDDM.
9112026|a|Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. A recent random genome mapping study has localized a locus termed NIDDM2 that maps to the region of chromosome 12 that includes MODY3, one of the three genes responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young, a monogenic form of NIDDM characterized by early age of onset and autosomal dominant inheritance. These findings suggest that NIDDM2 and MODY3 may represent different alleles of the same gene. MODY3 has recently been shown to be the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) thereby allowing us to determine whether mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene are present in subjects with late-onset NIDDM. We screened 84 white NIDDM patients of Danish ancestry and found four nucleotide substitutions that changed the sequence of HNF-1 alpha, Ile27--&gt;Leu, Ala98--&gt;Val, Ser487--&gt;Asn and Arg583--&gt;Gln, five nucleotide substitutions that were silent and did not change the amino acid, Leu17, Gly288, Leu459 and Thr515, and five substitutions in the intron regions. The frequencies of the codon 27, 98 and 487 amino acid variants were similar in 245 unrelated NIDDM patients and 242 age-matched control subjects. The Arg583--&gt;Gln mutation was found in 2 of 245 NIDDM patients and in none of the control subjects. Thus, genetic variation in the HNF-1 alpha gene is not a common factor contributing to NIDDM susceptibility in white subjects of Danish ancestry.

9133564|t|A prevalent amino acid polymorphism at codon 98 in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene is associated with reduced serum C-peptide and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.
9133564|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene cause the type 3 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3), which is characterized by a severe impairment of insulin secretion. In addition to disease-associated mutations, three common amino acid polymorphisms have been identified in the HNF-1alpha gene: Ile/Leu27, Ala/Val 98, and Ser/Asn487. We have addressed the question of whether these variants of the HNF-1alpha gene are associated with altered glucose-induced C-peptide and insulin responses or late-onset NIDDM. Among 245 NIDDM patients, the allelic frequency of the Val 98 variant was 3.7% (95% CI 2.0-5.4%) vs. 4.4% (2.6-6.2%) among 240 glucose tolerant control subjects (NS). Studies of genotype-phenotype interactions in 240 middle-aged control subjects showed, however, that heterozygous subjects (i.e., genotype Ala/Val 98) had an 18% decrease in 30-min serum C-peptide level (P = 0.004) as well as a 23% decrease in 30-min serum insulin level (P = 0.03) during an oral glucose tolerance test. One Val 98 homozygote subject had a more severe reduction in stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels. The impact of the homozygous carrier status was similar in a study of 377 healthy young subjects. In contrast, the Ile/Leu27 and Ser/Asn487 polymorphisms were not associated with altered C-peptide and insulin release or NIDDM. In conclusion, 8% of white subjects of Danish ancestry are heterozygous for the Ala/Val 98 polymorphism in the HNF-1alpha gene, which in middle-aged subjects is associated with a approximately 20% reduction in serum C-peptide and insulin responses 30 min after an oral glucose challenge. Val 98 homozygotes may exhibit a more severe defect in the early glucose-induced insulin response.

9162575|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), MODY genes and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
9162575|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, three MODY genes have been identified on chromosomes 20q [hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-4 alpha)/MODY1], 7p (glucokinase/MODY2) and 12q (HNF-1 alpha/MODY3). Mutations in glucokinase/MODY2 result in mild chronic hyperglycaemia due to reduced pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose as well as decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis following meals. In contrast, MODY1 and MODY3 are characterised by severe insulin secretory defects and major hyperglycaemia associated with microvascular complications. The role of the three known MODY genes in susceptibility to the more common late-onset from of NIDDM remains uncertain. Genetic studies seem to exclude any function as major susceptibility genes, although they may play a minor role in a polygenic context or a major role in particular populations.

9166684|t|Novel mutations and a mutational hotspot in the MODY3 gene.
9166684|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3) is a type of NIDDM caused by mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) located on chromosome 12q. We have identified four novel HNF-1alpha missense mutations in MODY3 families. In four additional and unrelated families, we observed an identical insertion mutation that had occurred in a polycytidine tract in exon 4. Among those families, one exhibited a de novo mutation at this location. We propose that instability of this sequence represents a general mutational mechanism in MODY3. We observed no HNF-1alpha mutations among 86 unrelated late-onset diabetic patients with relative insulin deficiency. Hence mutations in this gene appear to be most strongly associated with early-onset diabetes.

9231664|t|Pancreatic islet expression studies and polymorphic DNA markers in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4gamma, and -6.
9231664|a|The genes encoding the functionally related hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha play a critical role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function. Mutations in these liver-enriched transcription factors result in two forms of early-onset type 2 diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY]), MODY3 and MODY1, which are characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, early disease onset, and autosomal dominant inheritance. The transcriptional hierarchy of HNFs suggests that other proteins of the regulatory cascade might be responsible for other forms of MODY and/or late-onset type 2 diabetes. In this study, we show that HNF-3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4gamma, and -6 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells. We report the identification and characterization of simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms in the genes encoding HNF-3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4gamma, and -6 and the mapping of HNF-6 to chromosome bands 15q21.1-21.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These markers will be useful to study the role of genetic variation in these genes in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

9287053|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha/MODY3 gene in Japanese subjects with early- and late-onset NIDDM.
9287053|a|Recent studies have shown that mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene are the cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). We have screened 193 unrelated Japanese subjects with NIDDM for mutations in this gene: 83 with early-onset NIDDM (diagnosis at &lt;30 years of age) and 110 with late-onset NIDDM (diagnosis &gt; or = 30 years of age). All of the members of the latter group also had at least one sibling with NIDDM. The 10 exons, flanking introns, and promoter region were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and were sequenced directly. Mutations were found in 7 of the 83 (8%) unrelated subjects with early-onset NIDDM. The mutations were each different and included four missense mutations (L12H, R131Q, K205Q, and R263C) and three frameshift mutations (P379fsdelCT, T392fsdelA, and L584S585fsinsTC). One of the 110 subjects with late-onset NIDDM was heterozygous for the missense mutation G191D. This subject, who was diagnosed with NIDDM at 64 years of age, also had a brother with NIDDM (age at diagnosis, 54 years) who carried the same mutation, suggesting that this mutation contributed to the development of NIDDM in these two siblings. None of these mutations were present in 50 unrelated subjects with normal glucose tolerance (100 normal chromosomes). Mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene occur in Japanese subjects with NIDDM and appear to be an important cause of early-onset NIDDM in this population. In addition, they are present in about 1% of subjects with late-onset NIDDM.

9313763|t|Identification of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene in Japanese subjects with IDDM.
9313763|a|One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, MODY3, is characterized by a severe insulin secretory defect, compared with MODY2, a glucokinase-deficient diabetes. It has recently been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha cause MODY3. Because of the rapid progress to overt diabetes and the high prevalence of required insulin treatment in patients with MODY3, we screened the HNF-1 alpha gene for mutations in Japanese subjects with IDDM. Ten exons and flanking introns of the HNF-1 alpha gene in these subjects were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the products. Mutations were identified in three (5.5%) of the 55 unrelated subjects with IDDM. A missense mutation of R272H (replacement of Arg by His in codon 272) in the DNA binding domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject who developed IDDM 1 year after diagnosis of NIDDM at 8 years of age. A frameshift mutation of P291 fsinsC (insertion of a C in a polyC tract around codon 291 for Pro), which would generate a mutant truncated protein of 340 amino acids, was found in a subject who started insulin treatment when hyperglycemia and ketonuria were noticed at 13 years of age. A missense mutation of R583G (replacement of Arg by Gly in codon 583) in the transactivation domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject with sudden-onset IDDM at 20 years of age. None of these mutations were present in 100 nondiabetic subjects (200 normal chromosomes). These results indicate that the HNF-1 alpha gene defects could lead to the development of not only early-onset NIDDM but also IDDM, implicating the importance of subclassification of HNF-1 alpha-deficient IDDM from a classical type of autoimmune-based IDDM in Japanese.

9313764|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha binding site in the promoter of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene.
9313764|a|Recent studies have shown that mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha are the cause of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). These studies have identified mutations in the mRNA and protein coding regions of this gene that result in the synthesis of an abnormal mRNA or protein. Here, we report an Italian family in which an A--&gt;C substitution at nucleotide-58 of the promoter region of the HNF-1 alpha gene cosegregates with MODY. This mutation is located in a highly conserved region of the promoter and disrupts the binding site for the transcription factor HNF-4 alpha, mutations in the gene encoding HNF-4 alpha being another cause of MODY (MODY1). This result demonstrates that decreased levels of HNF-1 alpha per se can cause MODY. Moreover, it indicates that both the promoter and coding regions of the HNF-1 alpha gene should be screened for mutations in subjects thought to have MODY because of mutations in this gene.

9439666|t|A rapid screening method for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha frameshift mutations; prevalence in maturity-onset diabetes of the young and late-onset non-insulin dependent diabetes.
9439666|a|Non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) is a polygenic heterogeneous disorder of glucose homeostasis. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic subtype of NIDDM characterised by early-onset (&lt; 25 years) and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) gene have recently been shown to cause MODY. The incidence of mutations in this gene in MODY and late-onset NIDDM is not known. We have developed a rapid specific polymerase chain reaction test for HNF-1 alpha mutations; this test involves the use of fluorescently labelled forward primers and modified reverse primers to detect length polymorphisms resulting from frameshift mutations. With this method, we have screened 102 MODY probands, viz. 60 defined according to strict diagnostic criteria (autosomal dominant inheritance and at least one member diagnosed age &lt; 25 years) and 95 late-onset NIDDM probands (diagnosed 35-70 years with &gt; or = 1 affected relative), for the presence of 9 known HNF-1 alpha frameshift mutations, including 6 that occur at two sites for recurring mutation (residues 291/292 and 379). Mutations were detected in 11 of the strictly defined MODY probands and one mutation was also found in a single subject with early-onset NIDDM but no family history of the disease. The HNF-1 alpha frameshift mutations were not detected in any late-onset NIDDM subjects, suggesting these mutations do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM. Our results indicate that the prevalence of the nine frameshift mutations in strictly defined UK MODY is 18%, with the P291fsinsC mutation alone having a frequency of 13%.

9449683|t|A missense mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha, resulting in a reduced transactivation activity, in human late-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
9449683|a|Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion and action. Recent studies have found mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha gene (HNF-4alpha) in families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterized by early age at onset and a defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. During the course of our search for susceptibility genes contributing to the more common late-onset NIDDM forms, we observed nominal evidence for linkage between NIDDM and markers in the region of the HNF-4alpha/MODY1 locus in a subset of French families with NIDDM diagnosed before 45 yr of age. Thus, we screened these families for mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene. We found a missense mutation, resulting in a valine-to-isoleucine substitution at codon 393 in a single family. This mutation cosegregated with diabetes and impaired insulin secretion, and was not present in 119 control subjects. Expression studies showed that this conservative substitution is associated with a marked reduction of transactivation activity, a result consistent with this mutation contributing to the insulin secretory defect observed in this family.

9472859|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young: clinical heterogeneity explained by genetic heterogeneity.
9472859|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) can be defined by the clinical characteristics of early-onset Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in four genes have been shown to cause MODY: glucokinase, hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha), hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) and insulin promoter [corrected] factor 1 (IPF1). In white Caucasians it is now possible to define the gene in most patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY. Each gene involved in MODY has its own specific clinical and physiological characteristics. Patients with mutations of the glucokinase gene have mild fasting hyperglycaemia throughout life, and rarely require medication or develop microvascular complications. The principle pathophysiology is stable beta-cell dysfunction characterized by reduced sensing of glucose by the pancreas. Patients with mutations in HNF1alpha have normal glucose tolerance in early childhood and usually present with symptomatic diabetes in their late teens or early adulthood. They show increasing hyperglycaemia and treatment requirements with frequent microvascular complications. The underlying defect is progressive beta-cell failure, with the early lesion characterized by failure to increase insulin secretion with increasing glucose levels. Patients with HNF4alpha and IPF1 mutations show a similar clinical picture to HNF1alpha although diabetes may be diagnosed later. There are other patients with MODY in whom the genetic defect is still unknown. Molecular genetic testing in patients with diabetes offers the possibility of making a firm diagnosis of MODY and allows prediction of the future clinical course. The role of predictive testing in non-diabetic subjects within families is uncertain at present. Preliminary evidence suggests that maintaining insulin sensitivity by avoiding obesity and regular physical exercise may help delay the onset of diabetes.

9539292|t|Genetic, metabolic and clinical characteristics of maturity onset diabetes of the young.
9539292|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, three MODY genes have been identified on chromosomes 20q (MODY1/hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha), 7p (MODY2/glucokinase) and 12q (MODY3/HNF-1alpha). Mutations in MODY2/glucokinase result in mild chronic hyperglycaemia as a result of reduced pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, and decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis after meals. In contrast, MODY1 and MODY3 are characterised by severe insulin secretory defects, and by major hyperglycaemia associated with microvascular complications. The role of the three known MODY genes in susceptibility to the more common late-onset NIDDM remain uncertain. Genetic studies seem to exclude a role as major susceptibility genes, but leave unresolved whether they may have a minor role in a polygenic context or an important role in particular populations.

9562352|t|Chronic diabetic complications in patients with MODY3 diabetes.
9562352|a|MODY3 diabetes, which is caused by a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene (HNF-1alpha) on chromosome 12, represents a relatively common monogenic form of diabetes in Finland. Age at onset of the disease can vary from 10 to 60 years, but little is known about the natural course of the disease, particularly the development of diabetes-related chronic complications. The availability of genetic markers now allows description of the clinical course of the disease. In order to examine the prevalence of chronic diabetic complications in MODY3, we examined 57 carriers with HNF-1alpha mutations for the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications. Thirty-four percent of the MODY patients had mild and 13% had severe non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy; this figure did not differ from the figures in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients matched for duration and glycaemic control but not for age. Neither did the prevalence of microalbuminuria differ between MODY3 and IDDM or NIDDM patients (19 vs 24 and 23%). Neuropathy was observed with the same frequency as previously reported in IDDM. Hypertension was less frequent in MODY3 and IDDM than in NIDDM (24.5 and 19 vs 53.7%; p &lt; 0.001). Coronary heart disease was more common in MODY3 than in IDDM (16 vs 4.5%; p &lt; 0.02) but less common than in the older NIDDM patients (33.3%; p &lt; 0.02). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, poor glycaemic control was an independent risk factor for retinopathy (p = 0.03), microalbuminuria (p &lt; 0.04) and neuropathy (p = 0.03). In conclusion, microangiopathic complications are observed with the same frequency in patients with MODY3 diabetes as in IDDM and NIDDM and are strongly related to poor glycaemic control.

9621514|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene (MODY3) are not a major cause of early-onset non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus in Japanese.
9621514|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3), a monogenic subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with an early age of onset, is characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion. Recently, it has been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) cause MODY3. Since NIDDM in Japanese is characterized by insulin secretory defects due to primary beta-cell dysfunction, we screened 60 Japanese nonobese subjects with early-onset NIDDM for mutations in this gene, 45 of whom had a first-degree relative with NIDDM. Direct sequencing of the ten exons and flanking introns of the gene in these subjects identified eight nucleotide substitutions including two amino acid changes, Ile-27-Leu and Ser-487-Asn, the frequencies of which were not significantly different in subjects with early-onset NIDDM and nondiabetic subjects. These results suggest that mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene are not a major cause of early-onset NIDDM in Japanese.

9626139|t|Linkage and molecular scanning analyses of MODY3/hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene in typical familial type 2 diabetes: evidence for novel mutations in exons 8 and 10.
9626139|a|Mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1 alpha) gene are an important cause of autosomal dominant diabetes with onset before age 25 yr [maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)], and some regions of the HNF1 alpha gene appear to be hot spots for mutations. To evaluate the role of HNF1 alpha in the more common familial type 2 diabetes, we studied 62 families of Northern European origin by linkage analysis and molecular screening. Linkage was rejected under dominant models consistent with either late-onset type 2 diabetes or early-onset dominant diabetes. We used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to screen 53 diabetic members of 36 families who reported diabetes diagnosed before age 40 yr, 9 members of 2 Utah families with typical MODY, and 24 additional members of families with possible linkage. One MODY family showed the previously reported frameshift mutation (P291fsinsC) in exon 4. Among the individuals with more typical type 2 diabetes, we identified the previously reported common polymorphisms, a new intronic polymorphism, and 3 common amino acid variants. We also identified 2 novel missense mutations that segregated with type 2 diabetes in 1 family each: lysine for glutamic acid substitution at codon 619 in exon 10 (E619K), and an arginine for threonine substitution at codon 537 in exon 8 (R537T) in a second family. The exon 8 mutation showed relatively low penetrance, and the role in this family remains uncertain. No coding mutations were identified in the family members screened on the basis of linkage but without early-onset diabetes. Although HNF1 alpha mutations are not a common cause of familial type 2 diabetes, they may account for 5% of families in which at least 1 member has onset of type 2 diabetes before age 40 yr. Incomplete penetrance and a high sporadic frequency make linkage an inefficient screening tool.

9685261|t|Regulation of a transcription factor network required for differentiation and metabolism.
9685261|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) are a heterogeneous class of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that are required for cellular differentiation and metabolism. Mutations in HNF-1alphaand HNF-4alpha genes impair insulin secretion and cause type 2 diabetes. Regulation of HNF-4/HNF-1 expression by HNF-3alpha and HNF-3beta was studied in embryoid bodies in which one or both HNF-3alpha or HNF-3beta alleles were inactivated. HNF-3beta positively regulated the expression of HNF-4alpha/HNF-1alpha and their downstream targets, implicating a role in diabetes. HNF-3beta was also necessary for expression of HNF-3alpha. In contrast, HNF-3alpha acts as a negative regulator of HNF-4alpha/HNF-1alpha demonstrating that HNF-3alpha and HNF-3beta have antagonistic transcriptional regulatory functions in vivo. HNF-3alpha does not appear to act as a classic biochemical repressor but rather exerts its negative effect by competing for HNF-3 binding sites with the more efficient activator HNF-3beta. In addition, the HNF-3alpha/HNF-3beta ratio is modulated by the presence of insulin, providing evidence that the HNF network may have important roles in mediating the action of insulin.

9689059|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 acts as an accessory factor to enhance the inhibitory action of insulin on mouse glucose-6-phosphatase gene transcription.
9689059|a|Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways. Transcription of the gene encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase) is stimulated by cAMP and glucocorticoids whereas insulin strongly inhibits both this induction and basal G6Pase gene transcription. Previously, we have demonstrated that the maximum repression of basal G6Pase gene transcription by insulin requires two distinct promoter regions, designated A (from -271 to -199) and B (from -198 to -159). Region B contains an insulin response sequence because it can confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene. By contrast, region A fails to mediate an insulin response in a heterologous context, and the mutation of region B within an otherwise intact promoter almost completely abolishes the effect of insulin on basal G6Pase gene transcription. Therefore, region A is acting as an accessory element to enhance the effect of insulin, mediated through region B, on G6Pase gene transcription. Such an arrangement is a common feature of cAMP and glucocorticoid-regulated genes but has not been previously described for insulin. A combination of fusion gene and protein-binding analyses revealed that the accessory factor binding region A is hepatocyte nuclear factor-1. Thus, despite the usually antagonistic effects of cAMP/glucocorticoids and insulin, all three agents are able to use the same factor to enhance their action on gene transcription. The potential role of G6Pase overexpression in the pathophysiology of MODY3 and 5, rare forms of diabetes caused by hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 mutations, is discussed.

9703322|t|Mutation P291fsinsC in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha is dominant negative.
9703322|a|The type 3 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) results from mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha). The mechanism by which mutations in only one allele of the HNF-1alpha gene impair pancreatic beta-cell function is unclear. The functional form of HNF-1alpha is a dimer--either a homodimer or a heterodimer with the structurally related protein HNF-1beta--that binds to and activates transcription of the genes whose expression it regulates. HNF-1alpha is composed of three functional domains: an amino-terminal dimerization domain (amino acids 1-32), a DNA-binding domain with POU-like and homeodomain-like motifs (amino acids 150-280), and a COOH-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 281-631). Because the dimerization domain is intact in many of the mutant forms of HNF-1alpha found in MODY subjects, these mutant proteins may impair pancreatic beta-cell function by forming nonproductive dimers with wild-type protein, thereby inhibiting its activity; that is, they are dominant-negative mutations. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the functional properties of the frameshift mutation P291fsinsC, the most common mutation identified to date in MODY3 patients, and wild-type HNF-1alpha. P291fsinsC-HNF-1alpha showed no transcriptional transactivation activity in HeLa cells, which lack endogenous HNF-1alpha. Overexpression of P291fsinsC-HNF-1alpha in MIN6 cells, a mouse beta-cell line, resulted in an approximately 40% inhibition of the endogenous HNF-1alpha activity in a dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, heterodimer formation between wild-type and P291fsinsC mutant proteins were observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These data suggest that the P291fsinsC mutation in HNF-1alpha functions as a dominant-negative mutation. However, other mutations, such as those in the promoter region and dimerization domain, may represent loss of function mutations. Thus mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene may lead to beta-cell dysfunction by two different mechanisms.

9726235|t|Glucose utilization and production in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young caused by a mutation of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene.
9726235|a|Mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene cause impaired insulin secretion and hyperglycemia in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)3. Whether these mutations also affect glucose metabolism in tissues other than the beta-cell has not yet been documented. We therefore assessed, in five MODY3 patients and a dozen healthy control subjects, insulin secretion, oxidative and nonoxidative glucose disposal, and glucose production during a two-step hyperglycemic clamp and a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (0.4 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) clamp. Compared with healthy control subjects, MODY3 patients had higher fasting plasma glucose (+100%) but similar rates of fasting glucose production and oxidation. Both the early and late phases of insulin secretion were virtually abolished during the hyperglycemic clamp, and glucose production was suppressed by only 43% in MODY3 patients vs. 100% in healthy control subjects. The rate of glucose infusion required to produce a 5 mmol/l increase above basal glycemia was reduced by 30%, net nonoxidative glucose disposal (which is equal to net glycogen deposition) was inhibited by 39%, and net carbohydrate oxidation during hyperglycemia was 25% lower in MODY3 patients compared with control subjects. Insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and oxidation measured during the hyperinsulinemic clamp (at approximately 200 pmol/l insulin) were identical in MODY3 patients and in healthy control subjects, indicating that peripheral insulin sensitivity was not altered. Suppression of endogenous glucose production was, however, mildly impaired. It is concluded that MODY3 patients have severely depressed glucose-induced insulin secretion. The development of hyperglycemia in these patients appears to be caused by a decreased stimulation of glucose utilization, oxidation, and nonoxidative glucose disposal as well as by a blunted suppression of endogenous glucose output. These phenomena are essentially secondary to insulinopenia, whereas insulin sensitivity remains intact.

9754819|t|Mutation screening in 18 Caucasian families suggest the existence of other MODY genes.
9754819|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date five MODY genes have been identified: hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4alpha/MODY1/TCF14) on chromosome 20q, glucokinase (GCK/MODY2) on chromosome 7p, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1alpha/MODY3/TCF1) on chromosome 12q, insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF1/MODY4) on chromosome 13q and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1beta/MODY5/TCF2) on chromosome 17cen-q. We have screened the HNF-4alpha, HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta genes in members of 18 MODY kindreds who tested negative for glucokinase mutations. Five missense (G31D, R159W, A161T, R200W, R271W), one substitution at the splice donor site of intron 5 (IVS5nt + 2T--&gt;A) and one deletion mutation (P379fsdelT) were found in the HNF-1alpha gene, but no MODY-associated mutations were found in the HNF-4alpha and HNF-1beta genes. Of 67 French MODY families that we have now studied, 42 (63%) have mutations in the glucokinase gene, 14 (21%) have mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene, and 11 (16%) have no mutations in the HNF-4alpha, IPF1 and HNF-1beta genes. Eleven families do not have mutations in the five known MODY genes suggesting that there is at least one additional locus that can cause MODY.

9780731|t|[Mutations in the genes of the HNF-family cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)].
9780731|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterized by an early age of onset, often in childhood or adolescence and usually &lt; 25 years of age, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinical characterization of patients with MODY indicates that impaired insulin secretion is the primary defect responsible for the hyperglycemia in these patients. Genetic studies have thus far identified five MODY susceptibility genes, four of which encode transcription factors; HNF (hepatocyte nuclear factor)-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, HNF-4 alpha, and IPF1. The association of mutations in the genes for these transcription factors with early-onset familial diabetes indicates the importance of the HNF-regulatory network in determining pancreatic beta-cell function.

9792550|t|Novel susceptibility gene for late-onset NIDDM is localized to human chromosome 12q.
9792550|a|NIDDM has a substantial genetic component, but the nature of the genetic susceptibility is largely unknown. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic form of NIDDM characterized by an early age of onset and autosomal dominant inheritance, and linkage studies have identified genes that are mutated in different MODY pedigrees on chromosome 20 (MODY1 locus, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha [HNF-4alpha] gene), chromosome 7 (MODY2 locus, glucokinase gene), and chromosome 12 (MODY3 locus, HNF-1alpha gene). We studied an extended pedigree in which multiple members are affected by late-onset NIDDM associated with insulin resistance and performed linkage analysis with four microsatellite markers in the MODY3 region of chromosome 12q. We found significant evidence for linkage between NIDDM and the MODY3 locus (logarithm of odds score 3.65 at theta = 0.008 telomeric to marker D12S321), but sequencing of the 10 exons and promoter of HNF-1alpha did not identify any causative mutation in this gene. Our results indicate that the region of chromosome 12q close to MODY3 harbors a novel susceptibility gene or genes for NIDDM.

9796880|t|A low renal threshold for glucose in diabetic patients with a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene.
9796880|a|One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, Type 3 (MODY3), results from mutations in the gene coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), a transcription factor first described in the liver. MODY3 is characterized by a defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Earlier observations of glycosuria with normal blood glucose levels in some MODY families suggest an additional renal manifestation of the respective genetic defect. We measured the renal threshold for glucose in five diabetic carriers of a missense mutation (Arg 272 His) in HNF-1alpha and, for comparison, in eight Type 1 diabetic patients, applying a non-invasive protocol of frequent parallel blood and urine sampling during a slow shift in blood glucose levels. We found that the mean renal threshold for glucose was lowered in the HNF-1alpha diabetic patients compared to those with Type 1 diabetes (6.5 +/- 0.9 mmol l(-1) vs 10.7 +/- 0.5 mmol l(-1); p &lt; 0.01). This lowered glucose threshold might be an indication of an extra-pancreatic effect of HNF-1alpha gene mutations in humans. Defects in HNF-1alpha may lead to an altered tubular glucose reabsorption, possibly due to decreased expression of the renal glucose transporter proteins involved in reabsorption of glucose from the urine.

9814481|t|The effect of two frequent amino acid variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene on estimates of the pancreatic beta-cell function in Caucasian glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.
9814481|a|The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the frequent amino acid polymorphisms, Ile/Leu27 and Ser/Asn487, of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene were associated with alterations in glucose-induced serum C-peptide and serum insulin responses among glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients. The study comprised 2 independent Danish cohorts. Among 74 unrelated type 2 diabetic relatives, 12 homozygous carriers of the Ile/Leu27 polymorphism had a 32% decrease in the 30-min serum C-peptide level (P = 0.01), as well as a 39% decrease in the 30-min serum insulin level (P = 0.02) during an oral glucose tolerance test. Ten homozygous carriers of the Ile/Leu27 variant did, however, not differ from wild-type carriers, with respect to the acute circulating insulin and serum C-peptide responses during an i.v. glucose tolerance test in the same study cohort. In a larger (more than 3-fold) study group of 230 glucose tolerant offspring of 62 type 2 diabetic probands, 33 homozygous carriers of the Ile/Leu27 variant did not differ, with respect to either serum insulin and serum C-peptide levels during an oral glucose tolerance test or acute serum insulin and serum C-peptide responses during an i.v. glucose tolerance test. We therefore consider the former positive finding as a statistical type I error. There were no differences in the above mentioned variables between carriers of the Ser/Asn487 polymorphism and wild-type carriers within any of the 2 study populations. Nor did carriers of combined genotypes, i.e. carriers of both the Ile/Leu27 and the Ser/Asn487 variants, show any associations with the examined variables. In conclusion, the Ile/Leu27 and Ser/ Asn487 polymorphisms of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene have apparently no major impact on the pancreatic beta-cell function, after an oral and i.v. glucose challenge, in Caucasian first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.

9822613|t|Dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1alpha function results in defective insulin gene transcription and impaired metabolism-secretion coupling in a pancreatic beta-cell line.
9822613|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) have been linked to subtype 3 of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3), which is characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion. The role of HNF-1alpha in the regulation of pancreatic beta-cell function was investigated. Gene manipulation allowed graded overexpression of HNF-1alpha and controlled dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1alpha function in insulinoma INS-1 cells. We show that HNF-1alpha is essential for insulin gene transcription, as demonstrated by a pronounced decrease in insulin mRNA expression and in insulin promoter activity under dominant-negative conditions. The expression of genes involved in glucose transport and metabolism including glucose transporter-2 and L-type pyruvate kinase is also regulated by HNF-1alpha. Loss of HNF-1alpha function leads to severe defects in insulin secretory responses to glucose and leucine, resulting from impaired glucose utilization and mitochondrial oxidation. The nutrient-evoked ATP production and subsequent changes in plasma membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ were diminished by suppression of HNF-1alpha function. These results suggest that HNF-1alpha function is essential for maintaining insulin storage and nutrient-evoked release. The defective mitochondrial oxidation of metabolic substrates causes impaired insulin secretion, indicating a molecular basis for the diabetic phenotype of MODY3 patients.

9839108|t|Liver and kidney function in Japanese patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
9839108|a|OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, and HNF-4 alpha are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and are believed to cause this form of diabetes by impairing pancreatic beta-cell function. The HNFs also play a central role in the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression in liver and kidney, suggesting that patients with MODY due to a mutation in HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, or HNF-4 alpha may exhibit abnormal liver or kidney function. Here, we have examined liver and kidney function in a series of Japanese patients with HNF-4 alpha/MODY1, HNF-1 alpha/MODY3, and HNF-1 beta/MODY5 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical and biochemical data were obtained from Japanese subjects with HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, and HNF-4 alpha diabetes. The clinical data included information on BMI, age at diagnosis, current treatment, and the presence and nature of any complications. The biochemical studies examined liver and kidney function and included measures of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and 17 serum proteins. RESULTS: The present age and duration of diabetes were similar in patients with HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, or HNF-4 alpha diabetes, as was the age at diagnosis of diabetes in the youngest generation. All subjects were lean. Of the subjects with HNF-1 alpha and HNF-4 alpha diabetes, 50% were treated with insulin, as were all three subjects with HNF-1 beta diabetes. Retinopathy was present in patients with each form of diabetes. None of the subjects with HNF-4 alpha diabetes had evidence of nephropathy, whereas 36% of the patients with HNF-1 alpha diabetes and 100% of those with HNF-1 beta diabetes showed diminished kidney function. The three subjects with HNF-1 beta diabetes also had abnormally high serum creatinine, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen levels, which are consistent with impaired kidney function, and one of seven subjects with HNF-1 alpha diabetes had a mild elevation in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. These values were within the normal range in the three patients with HNF-4 alpha diabetes. Although the HNFs play a role in regulating the expression of the genes for most, if not all, serum proteins, there was no decrease in the levels of any of the 17 serum proteins examined, and most were within or slightly above the normal range. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels were elevated in the three patients with HNF-4 alpha diabetes and in one patient with HNF-1 beta diabetes, and in a second patient with HNF-1 beta diabetes, Lp(a) was at the upper limit of normal. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that as in white patients, MODY resulting from mutations in the HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta, and HNF-4 alpha genes in Japanese patients may be a severe disease similar to classic type 2 diabetes. In addition, they suggest that patients with HNF-1 beta diabetes may be characterized by diminished kidney function and perhaps abnormal liver function. Further studies are needed to determine whether tests of liver and kidney function will be useful in the diagnosis and subclassification of MODY.

9840451|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the Japanese population.
9840451|a|Recently, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha(HNF-1alpha, which is encoded by the TCF1 gene) mutations were reported in a subset of patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). We studied the contribution of TCF1 to genetic susceptibility to common non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2) in Japanese subjects by investigating allelic association with type 2 diabetes use of three markers. We also studied the frequency of the G191D mutation, the only mutation of TCF1 reported so far in late-onset type 2 diabetes. A total of 356 subjects were studied. There were no significant differences in allele frequency of the three markers between patients with type 2 diabetes and control subjects. A G191D mutation was not found in the subjects studied, giving a frequency of less than 0.4% in common type 2 diabetes. The lack of association of type 2 diabetes with three markers in and near TCF1 suggests that mutations in TCF1 derived from a limited number of founders are not a major cause of common type 2 diabetes even in the genetically homogeneous Japanese population. The data also indicate that the G191D mutation in TCF1 plays little, if any, role in susceptibility to common type 2 diabetes in the Japanese.

9851800|t|The Ala/Val98 polymorphism of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene contributes to the interindividual variation in serum C-peptide response during an oral glucose tolerance test: evidence from studies of 231 glucose-tolerant first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic probands.
9851800|a|The third form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young is caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene. Recently, we demonstrated an association between a prevalent polymorphism at codon 98, Ala/Val98, of this gene and a 20% decreased insulin release during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in middle-aged glucose-tolerant Danish Caucasian subjects. The major objective of the present study was to replicate this finding among glucose-tolerant first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients of the same ethnic origin. All participants, 231 glucose-tolerant offspring of 62 type 2 diabetic probands, underwent an OGTT with measurements of plasma glucose, serum insulin, and serum C peptide during the test. Thirty-three heterozygous carriers of the Ala/Val variant were identified, whereas no subjects had the variant in its homozygous form. Ala/Val carriers had a 20% reduction in serum C peptide at 30 min during the OGTT (1225+/-636 vs. 1507+/-624 pmol/L; P=0.02) compared to wild-type carriers. No significant differences in serum insulin levels during the OGTT were observed between carriers of the variant and Ala/Ala homozygotes. In conclusion, among Danish glucose-tolerant first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients the Ala/Val98 polymorphism of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene is associated with a decreased serum C-peptide secretion during an OGTT. This finding confirms our previously reported observation of the functional importance of the variant to insulin secretion during an OGTT among middle-aged healthy subjects.

9867222|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Caucasian families originally classified as having Type I diabetes.
9867222|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene are the cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), which is characterised by a severe impairment of insulin secretion and an early onset of the disease. Also at onset of diabetes some MODY patients show similar clinical symptoms and signs as patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of MODY3 patients misclassified as Type I diabetic patients. From a large population-based sample of unrelated Danish Caucasian Type I diabetic patients with an affected first degree relative, 39 patients (6.7%) who did not carry any high-risk HLA-haplotypes, i.e. DR3 or DR4 or both were examined by single-strand conformational polymorphism scanning and direct sequencing of the coding region and the minimal promoter of the HNF-1alpha gene. Four of the 39 Type I diabetic patients (10%) were identified as carrying mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene. One patient carried a missense mutation (Glu48Lys) in exon 1, two patients carried a missense mutation (Cys241Gly) in exon 4 and one patient carried a frameshift mutation (Pro291fsdelA) in exon 4. The mutations were all identified in heterozygous form, segregated with diabetes, and were not identified in 84 unrelated, healthy subjects. Furthermore, family history in three of the four families showed diabetes in four consecutive generations, suggestive of an autosomal dominant inheritance. In conclusion, about 10% of Danish diabetic patients without a high-risk HLA-haplotype, originally classified as having Type I diabetes could have diabetes caused by mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene. Clinical awareness of family history of diabetes and mode of inheritance might help to identify and reclassify these diabetic subjects as MODY3 patients.

10084598|t|The hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha G319S variant is associated with early-onset type 2 diabetes in Canadian Oji-Cree.
10084598|a|Mutations in the gene encoding hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) have been found in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We identified a new variant in the HNF-1alpha gene, namely G319S, in Ontario Oji-Cree with type 2 diabetes. G319S is within the proline II-rich domain of the trans-activation site of HNF-1alpha and alters a glycine residue that is conserved throughout evolution. S319 was absent from 990 alleles taken from subjects representing six other ethnic groups, suggesting that it is private for Oji-Cree. We found that 1) the S319 allele was significantly more prevalent in diabetic than nondiabetic Oji-Cree (0.209 vs. 0.087; P = 0.000001); 2) S319/S319 homozygotes and S319/G319 heterozygotes, respectively, had odds ratios for type 2 diabetes of 4.00 (95% confidence interval, 2.65-6.03) and 1.97 (95% confidence interval, 1.44-2.70) compared with G319/G319 homozygotes; 3) there was a significant difference in the mean age of onset of type 2 diabetes, with G319/G319, S319/G319, and S319/S319 subjects affected in the fifth, fourth, and third decades of life, respectively. In subjects with type 2 diabetes, we also found significantly lower body mass index and significantly higher post-challenge plasma glucose in S319/S319 and S319/G319 compared with G319/G319 subjects. Finally, among nondiabetic subjects, S319/G319 heterozygotes had significantly lower plasma insulin than G319/G319 homozygotes. The presence of the private HNF-1alpha G319S variant in a large number of Oji-Cree with type 2 diabetes and its strong association with type 2 diabetes susceptibility are unique among human populations. Also, G319S is associated with a distinct form of type 2 diabetes, characterized by onset at an earlier age, lower body mass, and a higher postchallenge plasma glucose.

10331424|t|Functional study of the E276Q mutant hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha found in type 1 maturity-onset diabetes of the young: impaired synergy with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II on the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 promoter.
10331424|a|Seven mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha gene have been shown to correlate with type 1 maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY 1), a monogenic form of type 2 diabetes. Up to now, only the functional properties of two MODY 1 HNF-4alpha mutants, Q268X and V393I, have been investigated to address how the mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene, found by genetic studies, can give rise to impaired activities of mutated HNF-4alpha proteins and can cause this disease. The E276Q mutation results in a nonconservative substitution occurring in the HNF-4alpha E domain, which is involved in dimerization and transactivation activities as well as in protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors or coactivators. Using the mutated human HNF-4alpha2, we have found that, in the absence of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP TFII), the E276Q substitution does not significantly affect the dimerization and transactivating activities of HNF-4alpha, at least on the promoters studied herein. On the other hand, in the presence of COUP TFII, the substitution impairs the enhancement of HNF-4-mediated activation of HNF-1 promoter. The impaired synergy between COUP TFII and HNF-4 on the HNF-1 promoter results from an alteration of their interaction. HNF-1 expression plays a crucial role in transactivation of insulin promoter and of numerous genes coding for enzymes involved in glucose homeostasis. Therefore, its downregulation resulting from the E276Q mutation in HNF-4alpha gene most probably impairs the function of pancreatic beta-cells.

10333057|t|Three new mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Japanese subjects with diabetes mellitus: clinical features and functional characterization.
10333057|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene are a common cause of the type 3 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We examined the clinical features and molecular basis of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-seven Japanese subjects with early onset Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and 45 with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus were screened for mutations in this gene. Functional properties of mutant HNF-1alpha were also investigated. RESULTS: Three new mutations [G415R, R272C and A site of the promoter (+ 102G-to-C)] were found. Insulin secretion was impaired in the three subjects. Insulin and glucagon secretory responses to arginine in the subject with the R272C mutation were also diminished. Molecular biological studies indicated that the G415R mutation generated a protein with about 50% of the activity of wild-type HNF-1alpha. The R272C mutation had no transactivating or DNA binding activity and acted in a dominant negative manner. The + 102 G-to-C mutation in the A site of the promoter activity was associated with an increase in promoter activity and it had 42-75% more activity than the wild-type sequence. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene may affect the normal islet function by different molecular mechanisms.

10417964|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY): a new challenge for pediatric diabetologists.
10417964|a|The differential diagnosis of hyperglycemia in childhood and adolescence has to take into consideration early-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes, defined as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). To date, mutations in genes of five proteins have been shown to cause MODY: glucokinase (MODY2), hepatic nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) (MODY3), hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4 alpha) (MODY1), insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF-1) (MODY4) and hepatic nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1 beta) (MODY5), but other MODY genes still await elucidation. Clinical and metabolic heterogeneity of these subtypes of type 2 diabetes need to be defined, as deficiency of each factor has its own phenotype. Pediatric diabetologists should be aware of the increasing importance of MODY as a possible cause of hyperglycemia in children and adolescents. This will allow for the early diagnosis of these metabolic conditions and for the appropriate follow-up and treatment.

10447526|t|High frequency of mutations in MODY and mitochondrial genes in Scandinavian patients with familial early-onset diabetes.
10447526|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the contribution of mutations in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and mitochondrial genes to early-onset diabetes with a strong family history of diabetes in a cohort with a high prevalence of Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Screening for sequence variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha (MODY1), glucokinase (MODY2), HNF-1alpha (MODY3) genes and mitochondrial DNA was carried out in 115 Finnish and Swedish patients with early-onset ( &lt;/= 40 years) diabetes using the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique and direct sequencing. Allele frequencies were compared with 118 patients with onset of diabetes Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus after the age of 40 and 92 non-diabetic control subjects without a family history of diabetes. RESULTS: In total 52 sequence variants were found in the HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and glucokinase genes, 12 of which were considered as MODY mutations. Three families had the A3243G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu) gene, which resulted in an overall prevalence of these mutations of 13 %. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Among 115 Scandinavian families, mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene represented the most common cause of familial early-onset ( &lt;/= 40 years) diabetes: MODY3 (5.2 %) more than MODY2 (3.5 %) more than MIDD (2.6 %) more than MODY1 (1.7 %).

10482964|t|Non-penetrance in a MODY 3 family with a mutation in the hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha gene: implications for predictive testing.
10482964|a|The most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a mutation in the hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene (MODY3). We describe a family in which a missense mutation causing a Thr-Ile substitution at codon 620 has been found in all affected members. The mutation is not fully penetrant as two family members aged 87 and 46 have the mutation but do not have diabetes. The severity and age of diagnosis of diabetes varies widely within the family, and most presented over the age of 25. HNF1alpha mutation screening should be considered in any family with autosomal dominant inheritance of diabetes where one member has presented with diabetes before the age of 25. Predictive testing is now possible within the majority of MODY families, and is of clinical benefit, but the possibility of non-penetrance should be addressed during counselling and interpretation of results.

10491332|t|Human insulin gene is a target gene of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) and HNF-1beta.
10491332|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early-onset, and impaired insulin secretion. The type 3 and type 5 forms of MODY result from mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-1beta, respectively. The mechanism by which mutations in one allele of the HNF-1 gene impair pancreatic beta cell function is unclear. We studied the effects of wild-type and four mutant (L12H, R263C, P379fsdelCT, and L584S585fsinsTC) HNF-1alpha, which were identified in Japanese subjects with MODY3 on human insulin gene transcription. Both wild-type (WT) HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta bound to the oligonucleotide containing the A3 element sequence in the human insulin promoter and transactivated the insulin-luciferase reporter gene by 30- and 31-fold, respectively. In contrast, binding of L12H, R263C and L584S585fsinsTC-HNF-1alpha to the probe was impaired. Transactivation activity by the four mutant HNF-1alpha was reduced (4.3 to 43.3% of WT). These data suggest that the insulin gene is a candidate target gene of HNF-1alpha/HNF-1beta and the impairment of insulin gene transcription by mutations in the HNF-1 gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of MODY.

10581189|t|Structure/function studies of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha, a diabetes-associated transcription factor.
10581189|a|Mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), a form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset, and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. We have examined the effects of five diabetes-associated mutations (L12H, G191D, R263C, P379fsdelCT, and L584S585fsinsTC) on HNF-1alpha function including DNA binding ability, intracellular localization, and transactivation activity. L12H, P379fsdelCT, and L584S585fsinsTC mutations were found in patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY, while G191D and R263C mutations were identified in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. These mutations had diverse effects on the functional properties of HNF-1alpha. Comparison of the functional data with clinical information suggested that transactivation activity of mutant HNF-1alpha in beta cells like MIN6 may be the primary determinants of the phenotypic differences observed among diabetic patients with HNF-1alpha mutations.

10585442|t|Anatomy of a homeoprotein revealed by the analysis of human MODY3 mutations.
10585442|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is an atypical dimeric homeodomain-containing protein that is expressed in liver, intestine, stomach, kidney, and pancreas. Mutations in the HNF1alpha gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). More than 80 different mutations have been identified so far, many of which involve highly conserved amino acid residues among vertebrate HNF1alpha. In the present work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which MODY3 mutations could affect HNF1alpha function. For this purpose, we analyzed the properties of 10 mutants resulting in amino acid substitutions or protein truncation. Some mutants have a reduced protein stability, whereas others are either defective in the DNA binding or impaired in their intrinsic trans-activation potential. Three mutants, characterized by a complete loss of trans-activation, behave as dominant negatives when transfected with the wild-type protein. These data define a clear causative relationship between MODY3 mutations and functional defects in HNF1alpha trans-activation. In addition, our analysis sheds new light on the structure of a homeoprotein playing a key role in pancreatic beta cell function.

10588527|t|Molecular genetics of diabetes mellitus in Chinese subjects: identification of mutations in glucokinase and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha genes in patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus/MODY.
10588527|a|AIMS: To examine the prevalence of identified MODY-related genes in Chinese subjects with early onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a positive family history of diabetes and to look for possible associations between the gene mutations and the development of diabetes. METHODS: Ninety-two unrelated Chinese subjects with diabetes diagnosed before the age of 40 years who had a positive family history of diabetes were screened for mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha) and glucokinase genes by direct sequencing. The family members of patients with mutations and 100 healthy controls were also examined. RESULTS: Mutations in the HNF-1alpha and the glucokinase genes were found in 5% and 3% of the diabetic subjects, respectively but no mutations were found in the coding region of the HNF-4alpha gene. Three mutations found in the glucokinase gene were novel missense mutations (I110T, A119D and G385V). The mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene were also new and included four missense mutations (G20R, R203H, S432C, I618M) and one splice acceptor site mutation (IVS2nt-1G--&gt;A). Patients with mutations in these genes were clinically heterogeneous with respect to phenotype and basal pancreatic beta cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors such as mutations in the HNF-1alpha and glucokinase genes may be important in the development of diabetes in Chinese people, especially when the disease is of early onset.

10601964|t|Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects with hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3) mutations.
10601964|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate insulin secretion and sensitivity in affected (diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance; n=7) and in unaffected (normal glucose tolerance; n=3) carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3 (MODY3)) gene mutations. METHODS: Insulin secretion was assessed by an i.v. glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), hyperglycemic clamp and arginine test, and insulin sensitivity by an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Results were compared with those of diabetic MODY2 (glucokinase-deficient) and control subjects. RESULTS: The amount of insulin secreted during an IVGTT was decreased in affected MODY3 subjects (46+/-24 (s.d.) pmol/kg body weight (BW)) as compared with values in MODY2 (120+/-49pmol/kg BW) and control (173+/-37pmol/kg BW; P=0.0004) subjects. The amount of insulin secreted during a 10mmol/l glucose clamp was decreased in affected MODY3 subjects (171+/-78pmol/kg BW) and MODY2 subjects (302+/-104pmol/kg BW) as compared with control subjects (770+/-199pmol/kg BW; P=0.0001). Insulin secretion in response to arginine was decreased in affected MODY3 subjects. Milder and heterogeneous defects were observed in the unaffected MODY3 subjects; the amount of insulin secreted during the hyperglycemic clamp was 40-79% of that of controls. The response to arginine was abnormally delayed. Insulin sensitivity was decreased in diabetic but not in non-diabetic MODY3 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-cell dysfunction in response to glucose and arginine is observed in affected and unaffected MODY3 subjects. The MODY3 and MODY2 subtypes present different insulin secretion profiles. Secondary insulin resistance might contribute to the chronic hyperglycemia of MODY3 patients and modulate their glucose tolerance.

10606640|t|Naturally occurring mutations in the human HNF4alpha gene impair the function of the transcription factor to a varying degree.
10606640|a|The hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4alpha, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates genes that play a critical role in embryogenesis and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the human HNF4alpha gene cause a rare form of type 2 diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1). To investigate the properties of these naturally occurring HNF4alpha mutations we analysed five MODY1 mutations (R154X, R127W, V255M, Q268X and E276Q) and one other mutation (D69A), which we found in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Activation of reporter genes in transfection assays and DNA binding studies showed that the MODY1-associated mutations result in a variable reduction in function, whereas the D69A mutation showed an increased activity on some promoters. None of the MODY mutants acted in a dominant negative manner, thus excluding inactivation of the wild-type factor as a critical event in MODY development. A MODY3-associated mutation in the HNF1alpha gene, a well-known target gene of HNF4alpha, results in a dramatic loss of the HNF4 binding site in the promoter, indicating that mutations in the HNF4alpha gene might cause MODY through impaired HNF1alpha gene function. Based on these data we propose a two-hit model for MODY development.

10634407|t|Identification and functional analysis of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in anti-islet autoantibody-negative Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes.
10634407|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene are the cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY 3), which is characterized by a severe impairment of insulin secretion and early onset of the disease. Although the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes have type 1A, immune-mediated diabetes, there is a significant percentage of the patients who have no evidence of an autoimmune disorder at the onset of disease. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of MODY 3 in antiislet autoantibody negative patients with type 1 diabetes. From a large population-based sample of unrelated Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes, 28 patients who lacked autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, islet cell antigen 512/insulinoma-associated antigen-2, phogrin (phosphate homolog of granules of insulinoma)/insulinoma-associated antigen-2beta, and insulin at the onset of type 1 diabetes were examined by PCR-based direct sequencing of the 10 exons, flanking introns, and the promoter region of the HNF-1alpha gene. Two (7.1%) of 28 autoantibody-negative patients with type 1 diabetes were identified as carrying mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene. One patient carried a frameshift mutation (Pro379fsdelCT) in exon 6, and another patient carried a novel 2-bp substitution at nucleotides +45 (G to A) and +46 (C to A) from the transcriptional site of the promoter region. These mutations were identified in heterozygous form and were not identified in 64 unrelated healthy control subjects or 54 unrelated islet autoantibody-positive patients with type 1 diabetes. Functional analysis of the mutant HNF-1alpha gene indicated that the Pro379fsdelCT mutation had no transcriptional trans-activation activity and acted in a dominant negative manner. The +45/46 GC to AA mutation in the promoter region showed reduced promoter activity by 10-20% compared to the wild-type sequence. In conclusion, about 7% of Japanese diabetic patients lacking antiislet autoantibodies initially classified as having type 1 diabetes could have diabetes caused by mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene.

10634821|t|The private hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha G319S variant is associated with plasma lipoprotein variation in Canadian Oji-Cree.
10634821|a|We previously showed an extremely strong association between type 2 diabetes and a private polymorphism, namely G319S, in the hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor (HNF)-1alpha. Because HNF-1alpha is involved in the transcription of several apolipoprotein genes, we tested for an association between the private HNF1A G319S variant and plasma lipoproteins in a sample of 55 unrelated Oji-Cree subjects with type 2 diabetes and 175 unrelated Oji-Cree subjects without type 2 diabetes. In Oji-Cree subjects with type 2 diabetes, we found that the HNF1A G319S genotype was significantly associated with lower plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B. In Oji-Cree subjects without type 2 diabetes, we found that the HNF1A G319S genotype was significantly associated with higher plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apo AI. There were no associations with plasma triglycerides or lipoprotein(a). Regression analysis indicated that the HNF1A genotype accounted for approximately 10% of the variation in the apo B-related traits in the diabetic subjects and for approximately 5% of the variation in the apo AI-related traits in the nondiabetic subjects. Furthermore, the regression model indicated that the HNF1A S319 allele affected these traits in a dominant manner in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. These findings provide the first evidence that a rare variant in a nuclear transcription factor is associated with variation in plasma lipoprotein traits.

10649494|t|Identification of seven novel nucleotide variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (TCF1) promoter region in MODY patients.
10649494|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a heterogeneous subtype of type II diabetes mellitus. To date, five MODY genes have been identified. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene are associated with MODY3. In the present work, we implemented the HNF-1alpha promoter region in the screening of MODY-suspect patients and identified seven variants not detected in control subjects. The family was available for the -119delG variant, and segregration between MODY and the variant is observed. Most of these variants are located in highly conserved regions and may alter HNF-1alpha expression through binding alteration of nuclear factors or other mechanisms. We demonstrate by functional studies that the transcriptional activity of the -283A&gt;C and -218T&gt;C variant promoters were 30% and 70% of the wild type activity, respectively. These data suggest that HNF-1alpha promoter variants could be diabetogenic mutations, and emphasize that the accurate HNF-1alpha expression is important for the maintenance of normal pancreatic beta cell function.

10690901|t|No evidence for linkage at candidate type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci on chromosomes 12 and 20 in United Kingdom Caucasians.
10690901|a|Several studies have identified evidence for linkage between type 2 diabetes and the regions on chromosomes 12 and 20 containing the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) and HNF-4alpha. Two studies examining the HNF-1alpha region have demonstrated evidence for linkage at genome-wide levels of significance, whereas four studies examining the HNF-4alpha locus have resulted in evidence for linkage at more suggestive levels of significance. The demonstration of linkage to these regions in additional patient series will strengthen the evidence that susceptibility alleles exist at these loci. We therefore assessed the evidence for linkage to these regions using a large cohort of United Kingdom Caucasian type 2 diabetes-affected sibling pairs. A maximum total of 315 affected full sibling pairs were typed for microsatellite markers across the MODY regions and, in a subset of families, for markers spanning the whole of chromosome 20. Evidence for linkage was assessed using a multipoint, mode of inheritance-free method. Linkage analysis did not reveal any significant evidence for excess allele sharing at any of the regions studied. Loci contributing sibling recurrence risks, relative to the general population risk, of 1.75 and 1.25 could be excluded for the HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha regions, respectively. We have not confirmed in United Kingdom Caucasians the evidence for linkage previously reported on 12q and 20q. Our results highlight further the problems of replicating previous positive linkage results across different ethnic groups.

10690959|t|Molecular scanning analysis of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1) gene in typical familial type 2 diabetes in African Americans.
10690959|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly inherited, but the major genes for this disease have been elusive. In contrast, early-onset, autosomal-dominant diabetes results from at least 5 loci, of which hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF1alpha or TCF1) is the most common cause. Mutations in HNF1alpha also cause later-onset diabetes in some Caucasian populations, but the role of these mutations has not been tested in African American populations. We used a variety of screening methods, including both single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and dideoxy fingerprint analysis, to search for mutations in 51 African American subjects with onset of diabetes before age 50 years. Potential mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. We identified 21 different variants, of which 11 were unique to African Americans. Four mutations either altered the amino acid sequence (Gly52Ala and Gly574Ser) or were close to a splice site (intron 1 and intron 10). A 5-nucleotide insertion in intron 1 was present in both diabetic members of a small family, but Gly52Ala, Gly574Ser, and the intron 10 mutation did not segregate with diabetes. Gly574Ser was present in 2 large families and 5% of controls, all of which appeared to share the same common HNF1alpha haplotype. Surprisingly, radioactive SSCP analysis under 2 room-temperature conditions performed as well as methods using fluorescent labeling that were expected to be more sensitive. We conclude that in African American individuals under age 50, variation in the HNF1a gene is common but unlikely to be a significant cause of T2DM.

10696112|t|Diabetes-associated mutations in a beta-cell transcription factor destabilize an antiparallel "mini-zipper" in a dimerization interface.
10696112|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, a monogenic form of Type II diabetes mellitus, is most commonly caused by mutations in hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha). Here, the dimerization motif of HNF-1alpha is shown to form an intermolecular four-helix bundle. One face contains an antiparallel coiled coil whereas the other contains splayed alpha-helices. The "mini-zipper" is complementary in structure and symmetry to the top surface of a transcriptional coactivator (dimerization cofactor of homeodomains). The bundle is destabilized by a subset of mutations associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Impaired dimerization of a beta-cell transcription factor thus provides a molecular mechanism of metabolic deregulation in diabetes mellitus.

10754480|t|Genetic and clinical characterisation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young in Spanish families.
10754480|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequencies of the major maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) subtypes in a panel of Spanish families and to assess phenotypic differences in patients with the different subtypes of MODY. METHODS: Forty-eight subjects from twenty families with clinical diagnosis of MODY were studied. They underwent a standardised clinical examination and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. Estimations of insulin sensitivity (%S) and insulin secretion capacity (%B) were calculated by the computer-solved homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Mutations in the coding regions of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha/MODY1, glucokinase (GCK/MODY2) and HNF-1alpha/MODY3 genes were investigated by single strand comformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Mutations in the GCK and HNF-1alpha genes were observed in 5 (25%) and 7 (35%) families respectively. Novel mutations included R385X, M238fsdelT, V226fsdelTinsAA and S418-7del11 in the GCK gene, and S121fsdelC, V133M, R159Q and V259D in the HNF-1alpha gene. No MODY1 families were found. Subjects which were neither MODY2 nor MODY3 (MODY-X) had a higher fasting glucose than subjects in the other groups. Insulin secretion capacity was similar in the three groups and the insulin sensitivity was decreased in MODY-X subjects. Glucose levels were significantly higher and insulin levels significantly lower, throughout the OGTT, in MODY3 compared with MODY2 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the GCK/MODY2 and HNF-1alpha/MODY3 genes account for the majority of cases in a panel of Spanish MODY families, with MODY3 being the most frequent subtype. The relative frequencies and the clinical characteristics of these MODY subtypes are in agreement with data previously reported in other European populations. MODY-X patients seem to present a heterogeneous clinical profile.

10807546|t|Disparity between association and linkage analysis for HNF1A G319S in type 2 diabetes in Canadian Oji-Cree.
10807546|a|In parallel experiments designed to find the genetic determinants of type 2 diabetes in Oji-Cree, we identified several linked chromosomal regions, using genomic scanning, in addition to a private diabetes-associated mutation, namely HNF1A G319S, using candidate gene sequencing. The genome scan did not identify the region harboring HNF1A as being linked with diabetes. Also, the HNF1A mutation, when used directly in sib-pair linkage analysis, was not linked with diabetes. However, HNF1A G319S was very strongly associated with diabetes, predicted the clinical severity of diabetes, and performed well as a diagnostic predictive test for diabetes in the Oji-Cree. Despite the failure of linkage analysis to identify HNF1A as a determinant of type 2 diabetes, we feel justified in interpreting that G319S has a very important pathogenic role in Oji-Cree diabetes, based upon the highly suggestive association studies. The probable etiologic heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes in the Oji-Cree created a situation in which association analysis was much more sensitive to detect a relationship between HNF1A S319 and diabetes than was linkage analysis. The effectiveness of linkage analysis will probably be limited in study samples that have an even greater complexity of genetic background and/or disease etiology. Thus, the absence of linkage does not always mean that a genomic variant is not an important determinant of a complex disease. Furthermore, our experience confirms the value of using several complementary strategies to identify susceptibility genes for a complex disease.

10840995|t|Clinical utility of HNF1A genotyping for diabetes in aboriginal Canadians.
10840995|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic performance characteristics of HNF1A genotyping for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in Canadian Oji-Cree Indians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied all Oji-Cree subjects &gt; or = 50 years of age (96 subjects) who had participated in a community-wide prevalence survey for type 2 diabetes. Subjects were classified either as having "disease," which included type 2 diabetes and IGT, or not. All subjects were genotyped for the HNF1A G319S mutation. RESULTS: The prevalence of disease in this group was 65.7%, of whom 71.4% had type 2 diabetes. For a carrier of HNF1A S319, the specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values were 97.0, 30.1, 95.0, and 42.1%, respectively. When the pretest disease prevalence was accounted for, the probability of disease after a positive test was 97.2%, and the probability of disease after a negative test was 42.2%. The values were very similar for the subgroup of subjects with type 2 diabetes alone. CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A genotype appears to be the most specific genetic test yet reported for the prediction of a common multifactorial disease by applying present-day standards of clinical epidemiology in molecular genetics. A positive test result had particular diagnostic value in the Oji-Cree: a subject with HNF1A S319 was virtually certain of having diabetes or IGT by 50 years of age. In contrast, a subject without HNF1A S319 had a reduced risk compared with the age-specific prevalence but was not totally risk-free. Because HNF1A S319 was not the only predisposing factor for diabetes in the Oji-Cree, subjects without HNF1A S319 were still at some risk for diabetes or IGT.

10843190|t|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 P12A and type 2 diabetes in Canadian Oji-Cree.
10843190|a|Among the Oji-Cree of northern Ontario, we previously identified a novel variant in the HNF1A gene, namely G319S, that was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of subjects with diabetes did not have the HNF1A S319 variant, suggesting that there might be other genetic determinants of diabetes susceptibility. In the course of sequencing candidate genes in diabetic subjects who were homozygous for HNF1A G319/G319, we found that some of them had the PPARG A12 variant. After genotyping PPARG in the entire adult Oji-Cree population, we found that: 1) PPARG A12 was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in women, but not men; 2) among women, the odds of being affected for carriers of PPARG A12 compared with noncarriers was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.8); and 3) among women, affected carriers of PPARG A12 had a significantly earlier age-of-onset and/or age-at-diagnosis compared with noncarriers. When taken together with the previously reported association of diabetes with HNF1A in both men and women, the gender-specific association with PPARG A12 confirms that type 2 diabetes is etiologically complex in the Oji-Cree and that at least two genes are involved in determining susceptibility to the disease in these people.

10852449|t|The I27L amino acid polymorphism of hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha is associated with insulin resistance.
10852449|a|Mutations of the hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene have been found in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We examined the relation between the I27L polymorphism of HNF-1alpha and insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function assessed by a hyperglycemic clamp. This study included 52 healthy glucose-tolerant and normotensive subjects (age, 19-40 yr; body mass index, 17.58-35.61 kg/m2; waist/hip ratio, 0.65-1.03). We identified 19 LL subjects, 24 IL, and 9 II subjects. No difference was noted in the demographic features among the three genotypes. The LL group had the highest postchallenge insulin levels at 30 and 90 min (P = 0.038 and P = 0.015, respectively) and also the highest insulin area under curve (P = 0.009) among the three genotypes. The LL group was more insulin resistant than the IL and II groups (P = 0.042 for insulin sensitivity index). After adjusting for age, gender, obesity, and ethnicity, the I27L polymorphism was an independent determinant of the insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.001). However, it had no impact on either the first or second phase insulin response. Therefore, we conclude that the I27L polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance, but not beta-cell function. The mechanism of this association is unclear, but HNF-1alpha may play a role in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism.

10868855|t|Mutations in the genes for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, -4alpha, -1beta, and -3beta; the dimerization cofactor of HNF-1; and insulin promoter factor 1 are not common causes of early-onset type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians.
10868855|a|OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous subtype of type 2 diabetes characterized by an early age at onset and autosomal dominant inheritance. MODY can result from heterozygous mutations in at least five genes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether alterations in known MODY genes and two MODY candidate genes contribute to the development of early-onset type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The coding regions of the known MODY genes hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, HNF-1beta, and insulin promoter factor 1 and the coding regions of two MODY candidate genes, HNF-3beta and the dimerization cofactor of HNF-1, were sequenced in genomic DNA from Pima Indians. The primary "affected" study population consisted of 46 Pima Indians whose age at onset of type 2 diabetes was &lt; or =20 years. DNA sequence variants identified in the affected group were then analyzed in a group of 80 "unaffected" Pima Indians who were at least 40 years old and had normal glucose tolerance. RESULTS: A total of 11 polymorphisms were detected in these genes. However, none of the polymorphisms differed in frequency among Pima Indians with an early age at onset of diabetes compared with older Pima Indians with normal glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in these known MODY or MODY candidate genes are not a common cause of early-onset diabetes in Pima Indians.

10872540|t|A novel mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha/MODY3 gene in Chinese subjects with early-onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Taiwan.
10872540|a|AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of mutation in hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, a gene recently implicated as causing maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and to analyse the respective clinical presentations in an ethnically Chinese population. METHODS: Fifteen unrelated subjects (nine females and six males) aged less than 35 years who had early-onset diabetes were analysed to test the possibility that mutation of the HNF-1alpha gene was responsible for this disorder. Genomic DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis were performed accordingly. RESULTS: One patient with MODY had a novel missense mutation in exon 3 of the HNF-1alpha gene (Y218C) in a region of the protein that corresponds to a predicted DNA binding domain. CONCLUSIONS: A Y218C mutation in HNF-1alpha gene was identified in one family in Taiwan.

10944108|t|Molecular targets of a human HNF1 alpha mutation responsible for pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.
10944108|a|The reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator system was employed in insulinoma INS-1 cells to achieve controlled inducible expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1 alpha)-P291fsinsC, the most common mutation associated with subtype 3 of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). Nuclear localized HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC protein exerts its dominant-negative effects by competing with endogenous HNF1 alpha for the cognate DNA-binding site. HNF1 alpha controls multiple genes implicated in pancreatic beta-cell function and notably in metabolism- secretion coupling. In addition to reduced expression of the genes encoding insulin, glucose transporter-2, L-pyruvate kinase, aldolase B and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, induction of HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC also significantly inhibits expression of mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) E1 subunit mRNA and protein. OGDH enzyme activity and [(14)C]pyruvate oxidation were also reduced. In contrast, the mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 were dramatically increased by HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC induction. As predicted from this altered gene expression profile, HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC also inhibits insulin secretory responses to glucose and leucine, correlated with impaired nutrient-evoked mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. These unprecedented results suggest the molecular mechanism of HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC causing beta-cell dysfunction.

10946909|t|Variability of the insulin receptor substrate-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), HNF-4alpha, and HNF-6 genes and size at birth in a population-based sample of young Danish subjects.
10946909|a|Reduced size at birth has been proposed to be a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It is, however, not known whether this association is explained by unfavorable intrauterine environment or by specific susceptibility genotypes predisposing for both reduced fetal growth and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The present study was performed to evaluate whether previously identified amino acid polymorphisms of genes that from animal models have been suggested to play important roles during fetal development are associated with alterations in size at birth. The study population comprised 380 subjects randomly recruited from a population of young Danish Caucasian individuals, aged 18-32 yr. The original data of birth length and weight for 331 of 380 subjects were obtained from the midwife records. The Gly/Arg972 of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the Thr/Ile130 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha), the Pro/Ala75 of HNF-6, and the Ile/Leu27, Ala/Val93, and Ser/Asn4s7 polymorphisms of the HNF-lalpha gene were examined for association with birth weight and length and the ponderal index. Using a generalized linear model, including gender and the genotype as fixed variables, and applying Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, we could not demonstrate any significant differences in these estimates among wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous carriers with respect to any of the gene variants. In conclusion, common variability in the genes encoding the IRS-1, HNF-lalpha, HNF-4alpha, and HNF-6 proteins can be excluded as major factors influencing size at birth among Danish Caucasian subjects.

10951547|t|Gender, obesity, hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha G319S and the age-of-onset of type 2 diabetes in Canadian Oji-Cree.
10951547|a|Among the Oji-Cree of northern Ontario, women have both a higher prevalence and an earlier onset of type 2 diabetes compared to men. We studied the relationship between HNF1A S319 and both the presence of and the age-of-onset of type 2 diabetes in women and men separately. We found that: 1) in women, there was a significant difference in the mean age-of-onset of type 2 diabetes according to HNF1A genotype; and 2) in men, there was no difference in the mean age-of-onset of type 2 diabetes according to HNF1A genotype. The findings indicate that HNF1A S319 is associated with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in both men and women, but with earlier age-of-onset in women only. One factor that might account for the gender difference in the onset of HNF1A S319-associated type 2 diabetes is the greater prevalence and severity, and earlier onset of, obesity among female Oji-Cree.

10966642|t|Structural basis of dimerization, coactivator recognition and MODY3 mutations in HNF-1alpha.
10966642|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) results from mutations in the transcriptional activator hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha). Several MODY3 mutations target the HNF-1alpha dimerization domain (HNF-p1), which binds the coactivator, dimerization cofactor of HNF-1 (DCoH). To define the mechanism of coactivator recognition and the basis for the MODY3 phenotype, we determined the cocrystal structure of the DCoH-HNF-p1 complex and characterized biochemically the effects of MODY3 mutations in HNF-p1. The DCoH-HNF-p1 complex comprises a dimer of dimers in which HNF-p1 forms a unique four-helix bundle. Through rearrangements of interfacial side chains, a single, bifunctional interface in the DCoH dimer mediates both HNF-1alpha binding and formation of a competing, transcriptionally inactive DCoH homotetramer. Consistent with the structure, MODY3 mutations in HNF-p1 reduce activator function by two distinct mechanisms.

10972586|t|Sensitivity to sulphonylureas in patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene mutations: evidence for pharmacogenetics in diabetes.
10972586|a|INTRODUCTION: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is characterized by autosomal dominantly inherited, early-onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene are the commonest cause of MODY. Individual patients with HNF-1alpha mutations have been reported as being unusually sensitive to the hypoglycaemic effects of sulphonylurea therapy. We report three patients, attending a single clinic, with HNF-1alpha mutations that show marked hypersensitivity to sulphonylureas. CASE REPORTS: In cases 1 and 2 there were marked changes in HbA1c on cessation (4.4% and 5.8%, respectively) and reintroduction (5.0% and 2.6%) of sulphonylureas. Case 3 had severe hypoglycaemic symptoms on the introduction of sulphonylureas despite poor glycaemic control and was shown with a test dose of 2.5 mg glibenclamide to have symptomatic hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 2 mmol/l) after 4 h despite eating. CONCLUSIONS: HNF-1alpha MODY diabetic subjects are more sensitive to sulphonylureas than Type 2 diabetic subjects and this is seen in different families, with different mutations and may continue up to 13 years from diagnosis. This is an example of pharmacogenetics, with the underlying aetiological genetic defect altering the pharmacological response to treatment. The present cases suggest that in HNF-1alpha MODY patients: (i) sulphonylureas can dramatically improve glycaemic control and should be considered as initial treatment for patients with poor glycaemic control on an appropriate diet; (ii) hypoglycaemia may complicate the introduction of sulphonylureas and therefore very low doses of short acting sulphonylureas should be used initially; and (iii) cessation of sulphonylureas should be undertaken cautiously as there may be marked deterioration in glycaemic control.

10980542|t|Proposed mechanism for a novel insertion/deletion frameshift mutation (I414G415ATCG--&gt;CCA) in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) gene which causes maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
10980542|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic subgroup of non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) characterized by an early age of diagnosis (usually &lt; 25 years) and an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1alpha) [MODY3] gene represent the most common cause of MODY in the UK and a common cause of MODY in many other populations. Sixty-three different mutations have been described in a total of 112 families worldwide. This report describes two families, not known to be related, who carry a novel insertion/deletion mutation (I414G415ATCG--&gt;CCA) and a 6bp intronic deletion of the HNF-1alpha gene in cis. We propose that the insertion/deletion mutation has arisen by formation of a hairpin loop due to the presence of a quasi-palindromic sequence, followed by insertion of CC and deletion of TCG resulting in the increased stability of the hairpin loop.

11014387|t|A novel dominant-negative mutation of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Japanese early-onset type 2 diabetes.
11014387|a|We investigated the presence and the function of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) mutations in 26 Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes. The subjects were between 20 and 39 years of age on diagnosis and had diabetic first-degree relatives. Two different frameshift mutations were found in 2 subjects (8 %). One novel mutation, T539fsdelC (deletion of C in codon 539 for Thr), is predicted to generate a protein of normal 539 residues at the N-terminus followed by an abnormal 119 amino acid protein. The mutation, P291fsinsC (insertion of C in codon 291 for Pro) should lead to production of a truncated protein of 315 amino acids. Transfection reporter assay using MIN6 and HepG2 cells revealed both mutations to have null function in the transactivation of reporter gene expression. When transfected with wild-type gene, these mutations behaved as dominant-negative regulators in both cells. An equimolar amount of T539fsdelC reduced wild-type activity by approximately 80% in MIN6 cells, while the same concentration of P291fsinsc reduced it by 30%. The sequences responsible for the transactivation activity of HNF-1alpha are confined largely to amino acids 547-628, so that the T539fsdelC mutation, which affects this entire region, replacing amino acids 540-631 with an abnormal 119 amino acid protein, may acquire a potent dominant-negative function.

11023148|t|Variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha and -4alpha genes in Finnish and Chinese subjects with late-onset type 2 diabetes.
11023148|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes in the etiology of late-onset type 2 diabetes in Finnish and Chinese subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The whole coding regions of the genes encoding for HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha, including approximately 800 bp of the HNF-1alpha promoter, were investigated in 40 Finnish subjects (fasting C-peptide 50-570 pmol/l) and 47 Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Frequencies of the variants of these genes were analyzed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis in additional samples of 100 Finnish diabetic patients and 82 Finnish control subjects and in 58 Chinese diabetic patients and 51 Chinese control subjects. RESULTS: No previously reported gene defects were detected, but one novel functionally silent GCC--&gt;GCG variant (nucleotide 73, exon 10) was observed in the HNF-4alpha gene in a Chinese diabetic patient. Interestingly, the Ala98Val substitution of the HNF-1alpha gene occurred at a significantly higher frequency in 140 Finnish diabetic patients compared with 82 control subjects (P = 0.014). The Ala98Val variant was not, however, associated with abnormalities in insulin secretion evaluated by oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests in subjects with normal (n = 295) or impaired (n = 38) glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in the HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of late-onset type 2 diabetes in Finnish and Chinese subjects. However, the association of the Ala98Val variant of the HNF-1alpha gene with type 2 diabetes in Finnish subjects may indicate a diabetogenic locus close to the HNF-1alpha gene.

11058894|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) mutations in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
11058894|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early age of onset (&lt;25 years) and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. MODY is genetically heterogeneous with five different genes identified to date: hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4 alpha) [MODY1]; glucokinase [MODY2]; hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) [MODY3]; insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) [MODY4]; and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1 beta) [MODY5]. Mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene represent a common cause of MODY in the majority of populations studied. Sixty-five different mutations have been described in a total of 116 families. The most common mutation is a C-insertion (P291fsinsC) in the polyC tract of exon 4, which has been reported in 22 families. The identification of an HNF-1 alpha gene mutation in a patient with type 2 diabetes confirms the diagnosis of MODY and has important implications for clinical management.

11121425|t|A molecular link between the common phenotypes of type 1 glycogen storage disease and HNF1alpha-null mice.
11121425|a|The clinical manifestations of type 1 glycogen storage disease (GSD-1) in patients deficient in the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) system (e.g. growth retardation, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and renal dysfunction) are shared by Hnf1alpha(-/-) mice deficient of a transcriptional activator, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha). However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. The G6Pase system, essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, is comprised of glucose 6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) and G6Pase. G6PT translocates G6P from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where it is metabolized by G6Pase to glucose and phosphate. Deficiencies in G6Pase and G6PT cause GSD-1a and GSD-1b, respectively. Hnf1alpha(-/-) mice also develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus caused by defective insulin secretion. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is a molecular link between HNF1alpha deficiency and function of the G6Pase system. Transactivation studies revealed that HNF1alpha is required for transcription of the G6PT gene. Hepatic G6PT mRNA levels and microsomal G6P transport activity are also markedly reduced in Hnf1alpha(-/-) mice as compared with Hnf1alpha(+/+) and Hnf1alpha(+/-) littermates. On the other hand, hepatic G6Pase mRNA expression and activity are up-regulated in Hnf1alpha(-/-) mice, consistent with observations that G6Pase expression is increased in diabetic animals. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that metabolic abnormalities in HNF1alpha-null mice are caused in part by G6PT deficiency and by perturbations of the G6Pase system.

11162430|t|MODY associated with two novel hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha loss-of-function mutations (P112L and Q466X).
11162430|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterized by early onset of pancreatic dysfunction. MODY type 3 is caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha. During a screening of Norwegian patients with suspected MODY we identified two novel HNF-1alpha mutations, P112L and Q466X. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease were studied by analyzing the DNA binding properties, transcriptional activation, and subcellular localization of HNF-1alpha P112L and Q466X compared to wild type HNF-1alpha. P112L had reduced ability to bind an HNF1 consensus sequence and to activate transcription. Q466X did not differ from wild type HNF-1alpha in DNA binding activity. Transactivation, however, was markedly reduced. When both mutants were coexpressed with wild type HNF-1alpha in HeLa cells, transcriptional activity appeared unaffected, suggesting that a dominant-negative mechanism was not present. Immunolocalization experiments showed that P112L HNF-1alpha was correctly targeted to nuclei in HeLa cells. In contrast, some Q466X HNF-1alpha protein was retained in the cytoplasm, which indicated that the mechanism for nuclear localization was disturbed. Thus, the HNF-1alpha mutations P112L and Q466X both seem to impair pancreatic beta-cell function by loss-of-function mechanisms; P112L by reduced DNA binding and reduced ability to transactivate, and Q466X by reduced transactivation and incomplete nuclear targeting.

11174836|t|Counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young caused by HNF-1alpha gene mutations (MODY3).
11174836|a|Mutations of HNF-1alpha lead to severe beta cell dysfunction, resulting in decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion. HNF-1alpha is also expressed in liver, kidney and pancreatic alpha cells, but the functional consequences of HNF-1alpha mutations in these organs remain unknown. We therefore assessed the counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia in six patients with HNF-1alpha mutations (MODY3), five patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in nine healthy controls. Plasma glucagon concentrations and endogenous glucose production were measured every 15 min during a hyperinsulinemic clamp with progressive hypoglycemia. Plasma glucagon concentrations were similar at basal glycemia (73+/-6, 69+/-5 and 69+/-7 ng/l) and reached peak values of 88+/-9, 88+/-11 and 89+/-7 ng/l at a glycemia of 3.6 mmol/l in MODY3 patients, patients with NIDDM and controls respectively (NS). Suppression of endogenous glucose production by insulin was blunted in MODY3 patients (3.3+/-1.2 micromol/kg per min) and in patients with NIDDM (4.4+/-0.6 micromol/kg per min) compared with controls (1.7+/-0.5 micromol/kg per min, P&lt;0.05 compared with both MODY3 patients and patients with NIDDM). During hypoglycemia, endogenous glucose production increased to 8.6+/-2.1, 8.8+/-0.7 and 7.0+/-1.0 micromol/kg per min in MODY3 patients, patients with NIDDM and controls respectively (all NS). These data indicate that mutations of HNF-1alpha in MODY3 do not result in a decreased glucagon secretion or alterations of glucose production during hypoglycemia.

11202217|t|Diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young in the pediatric diabetes clinic.
11202217|a|The diagnosis of pediatric diabetes mellitus (DM) traditionally is not considered a diagnostic specialty. However, considerable heterogeneity in the etiology of DM is seen among children and adolescents, making the recognition of discrete subgroups of DM very important for determining prognosis and appropriate treatment. The subgroups that result in non-insulin-dependent DM in children are as follows: the 'honeymoon' phase of type 1 DM, type 2 DM, genetic syndromes accompanied by DM, and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The relative prevalence of these different subgroups depends on the population being studied. In the UK, in pediatric clinics where most patients are Caucasian, MODY is over 10 times more prevalent than type 2 DM. However, type 2 DM would predominate in a clinic where most children are from populations with a high prevalence of this condition (e.g. Asian Indians). It should be emphasized that MODY comprises two discrete clinical syndromes: glucokinase diabetes and transcription factor diabetes, the latter of which results from mutations in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-1beta, HNF-4alpha and insulin promoter factor-1.

11232004|t|Early-onset type 2 diabetes: metabolic and genetic characterization in the mexican population.
11232004|a|The objective of this study was to investigate possible defects in the insulin sensitivity and/or the acute insulin response in a group of Mexican patients displaying early-onset type 2 diabetes and to evaluate the contribution of mutations in three of the genes linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We studied 40 Mexican patients with an age of diagnosis between 20 and 40 yr in which the insulin sensitivity as well as the insulin secretory response were measured using the minimal model approach. A partial screening for possible mutations in 3 of the 5 genes linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young was carried out by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. A low insulin secretory capacity (AIRg = 68.5 +/- 5 muU/mL.min) and a near-normal insulin sensitivity (3.43 +/- 0.2 min/muU.mL x 10(4)) were found in these patients. Among this group we found two individuals carrying missense mutations in exon 4 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-4alpha) gene (Asp(126)--&gt;His/Tyr and Arg(154)--&gt;Gln, respectively) and one carrying a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the HNF-1alpha gene (Gln(486)--&gt;stop codon); 7.5% had positive titers for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. Thirty-five percent of cases had insulin resistance; these subjects had the lipid abnormalities seen in the metabolic syndrome. A defect in insulin secretion is the hallmark in Mexican diabetic patients diagnosed between 20 and 40 yr of age. Mutations in either the HNF-1alpha or the HNF-4alpha genes are present among the individuals who develop early-onset diabetes in our population. These particular sequence changes have not been previously reported and therefore represent putative new mutations. Even in the absence of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance is associated with an adverse lipid profile.

11269503|t|HNF1alpha controls renal glucose reabsorption in mouse and man.
11269503|a|Recently it has been shown that dominant mutations in the human hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene, encoding for a homeoprotein that is expressed in liver, kidney, pancreas and intestine, result in maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). HNF1alpha-null mice are diabetic, but at the same time suffer from a renal Fanconi syndrome characterized by urinary glucose loss. Here we show that MODY3 patients are also characterized by a reduced tubular reabsorption of glucose. The renal murine defect is due to reduced expression of the low affinity/high capacity glucose cotransporter (SGLT2). Our results show that HNF1alpha directly controls SGLT2 gene expression. Together these data indicate that HNF1alpha plays a key role in glucose homeostasis in mammals.

11272165|t|beta-cell genes and diabetes: quantitative and qualitative differences in the pathophysiology of hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha and glucokinase mutations.
11272165|a|Mutations in the beta-cell genes encoding the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) and the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha are the most common causes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Studying patients with mutations in these genes gives insights into the functions of these two critical beta-cell genes in humans. We studied 178 U.K. and French MODY family members, including 45 GCK mutation carriers and 40 HNF-1alpha mutation carriers. Homeostasis model assessment of fasting insulin and glucose showed reduced beta-cell function in both GCK (48% controls, P&lt;0.0001) and HNF-1alpha (42% controls, P&lt;0.0001). Insulin sensitivity was similar to that of control subjects in the GCK subjects (93% controls, P = 0.78) but increased in the HNF-1alpha subjects (134.5% controls, P = 0.005). The GCK patients showed a similar phenotype between and within families with mild lifelong fasting hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 5.5-9.2 mmol/l, interquartile [IQ] range 6.6-7.4), which declined slightly with age (0.017 mmol/l per year) and rarely required pharmacological treatment (17% oral hypoglycemic agents, 4% insulin). HNF-1alpha patients showed far greater variation in fasting glucose both between and within families (FPG 4.1-18.5 mmol/l, IQ range 5.45-10.4), with a marked deterioration with age (0.06 mmol/l per year), and 59% of patients required treatment with tablets or insulin. Proinsulin-to-insulin ratios are increased in HNF-1alpha subjects (29.5%) but not in GCK (18.5%) subjects. In an oral glucose tolerance test, the 0- to 120-min glucose increment was small in GCK patients (2.4+/-1.8 mmol/l) but large in HNF-1alpha patients (8.5+/-3.0 mmol/l, P&lt; 0.0001). This comparison shows that the clear clinical differences in these two genetic subgroups of diabetes reflect the quantitative and qualitative differences in beta-cell dysfunction. The defect in GCK is a stable defect of glucose sensing, whereas the HNF-1alpha mutation causes a progressive defect that alters beta-cell insulin secretion directly rather than the sensing of glucose.

11272211|t|beta-cell genes and diabetes: molecular and clinical characterization of mutations in transcription factors.
11272211|a|beta-Cell transcription factor genes are important in the pathophysiology of the beta-cell, with mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha, HNF-4alpha, insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1, HNF-1beta, and NeuroD1/BETA2, all resulting in early-onset type 2 diabetes. We assessed the relative contribution of these genes to early-onset type 2 diabetes using linkage and sequencing analysis in a cohort of 101 families (95% U.K. Caucasian). The relative distribution of the 90 families fitting maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) criteria was 63% HNF-1alpha, 2% HNF-4alpha, 0% IPF-1, 1% HNF-1beta, 0% NeuroD1/ BETA2, and 20% glucokinase. We report the molecular genetic and clinical characteristics of these patients including 29 new families and 8 novel HNF-1alpha gene mutations. Mutations in the transactivation domain are more likely to be protein truncating rather than result in amino acid substitutions, suggesting that a relatively severe disruption of this domain is necessary to result in diabetes. Mutations in the different transcription factors result in clinical heterogeneity. IPF-1 mutations are associated with a higher age at diagnosis (42.7 years) than HNF-1alpha (20.4 years), HNF-1beta (24.2 years), or HNF-4alpha (26.3 years) gene mutations. Subjects with HNF-1beta mutations, in contrast to the other transcription factors, frequently present with renal disease. A comparison of age at diagnosis between subjects with different types and locations of HNF-1alpha mutations did not reveal genotype-phenotype correlations. In conclusion, mutations in transcription factors expressed in the beta-cell are the major cause of MODY, and the phenotype clearly varies with the gene that is mutated. There is little evidence to indicate that different mutations within the same gene have different phenotypes.

11286643|t|Genes and environment in type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis in aboriginal Canadians.
11286643|a|The incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) among aboriginal people in northern Ontario has tripled over the past 20 years. This is inextricably linked to the remarkably high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in these native communities. Approximately 40% of the Oji-Cree of northern Ontario have typical obesity-related type 2 diabetes, which represents a drastic increase from virtually unreportable levels 50 years ago. The Oji-Cree have a private mutation in the HNF1A gene, namely G319S, which is absent from other ethnic groups and aboriginal populations. The most compelling reasons that HNF1A S319 is a diabetes-susceptibility allele are its consistent statistical association with the presence and severity of diabetes. Also, HNF1A S319 has specificity and positive predictive values of 97% and 95%, respectively, for the development of diabetes in the Oji-Cree by 50 years of age. This makes the HNF1A G319S genotype the most specific predictive genetic test for diabetes in any human population. HNF1A S319 has all the attributes of a thrifty allele in the Oji-Cree. It is possible that the recent increase in CHD in the aboriginal people of northern Ontario is the result of the expression of diabetes susceptibility due to HNF1A S319 as a consequence of rapid changes in environment and lifestyle.

11287626|t|Hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha directs nucleosomal hyperacetylation to its tissue-specific transcriptional targets.
11287626|a|Mutations in the gene encoding hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1-alpha) cause a subtype of human diabetes resulting from selective pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. We have analyzed mice lacking HNF1-alpha to study how this protein controls beta-cell-specific transcription in vivo. We show that HNF1-alpha is essential for the expression of glut2 glucose transporter and L-type pyruvate kinase (pklr) genes in pancreatic insulin-producing cells, whereas in liver, kidney, or duodenum tissue, glut2 and pklr expression is maintained in the absence of HNF1-alpha. HNF1-alpha nevertheless occupies the endogenous glut2 and pklr promoters in both pancreatic islet and liver cells. However, it is indispensable for hyperacetylation of histones in glut2 and pklr promoter nucleosomes in pancreatic islets but not in liver cells, where glut2 and pklr chromatin remains hyperacetylated in the absence of HNF1-alpha. In contrast, the phenylalanine hydroxylase promoter requires HNF1-alpha for transcriptional activity and localized histone hyperacetylation only in liver tissue. Thus, different HNF1-alpha target genes have distinct requirements for HNF1-alpha in either pancreatic beta-cells or liver cells. The results indicate that HNF1-alpha occupies target gene promoters in diverse tissues but plays an obligate role in transcriptional activation only in cellular- and promoter-specific contexts in which it is required to recruit histone acetylase activity. These findings provide genetic evidence based on a live mammalian system to establish that a single activator can be essential to direct nucleosomal hyperacetylation to transcriptional targets.

11289470|t|Role of common sequence variants in insulin secretion in familial type 2 diabetic kindreds: the sulfonylurea receptor, glucokinase, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha genes.
11289470|a|OBJECTIVE: We have demonstrated high heritability of insulin secretion measured as acute insulin response to glucose times insulin sensitivity (disposition index). Furthermore, we showed that obese normoglycemic family members of a type 2 diabetic proband failed to compensate for the insulin resistance of obesity by increasing insulin secretion. In this study, we tested the primary hypotheses that previously described variants in the pancreatic sulfonylurea receptor gene (SUR1 or ABCC8), glucokinase (GCK) gene, or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1 or HNF1alpha) gene contribute to the inherited deficiencies of insulin secretion and beta-cell compensation to insulin resistance, as well as the secondary hypotheses that these variants altered insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We typed 124 nondiabetic members of 26 familial type 2 diabetic kindreds who had undergone tolbutamide-modified intravenous glucose tolerance tests for two variants of the ABCC8 (sulfonylurea) gene, two variants of the GCK gene, and one common amino acid variant in the TCF1 (HNF1alpha) gene. All family members were classified as normal or having impaired glucose tolerance based on oral glucose tolerance testing. We used minimal model analysis to calculate the insulin sensitivity index (S1) and glucose effectiveness (SG), and acute insulin response to glucose was calculated as the mean insulin excursion above baseline during the first 10 min after the glucose bolus. Disposition index (DI), a measure of beta-cell compensation for insulin sensitivity, was calculated as insulin sensitivity times acute insulin response. Effects of polymorphisms were determined using mixed effects models that incorporated family membership and by a likelihood analysis that accounted for family structure through polygenic inheritance. RESULTS: An intronic variant of the ABCC8 gene just upstream of exon 16 was a significant determinant of both DI and an analogous index based on acute insulin response to tolbutamide. Surprisingly, heterozygous individuals showed the lowest indexes, whereas the DI in the two homozygous states did not differ significantly. Neither the exon 18 variant nor the variants in the GCK and TCF1 genes were significant in this model. However, combined genotypes of ABCC8 exon 16 and 18 variants again significantly predicted both indexes of glucose and tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, a variant in the 3' untranslated region of the GCK gene interacted significantly with BMI to predict insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The exon 16 variant of the ABCC8 gene reduced beta-cell compensation to the decreased insulin sensitivity in the heterozygous state. This may explain the observation from several groups of an association of the ABCC8 variants in diabetes and is consistent with other studies showing a role of ABCC8 variants in pancreatic beta-cell function. However, our study focused on individuals from relatively few families. Ascertainment bias, family structure, and other interacting genes might have influenced our unexpected result. Additional studies are needed to replicate our observed deficit in beta-cell compensation in individuals heterozygous for ABCC8 variants. Likewise, the role of the GCK 3' variant in the reduced insulin sensitivity of obesity will require further study.

11293229|t|[Molecular background and clinical characteristics of autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes mellitus].
11293229|a|Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease and genetic as well as environmental factors play a role in its pathogenesis. Six different genes have been identified so far to be responsible for rare forms of autosomal dominant, early onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. All but one are transcription factors which influence expression of the other genes through the regulation of mRNA synthesis. These are hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 alpha, HNF-1 alpha, insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1 and HNF-1 beta, which are associated with MODY1, 3, 4, 5 respectively. MODY1 is a relatively rare and usually severe form of diabetes. It is associated with progressive hyperglycemia and frequent chronic complications. The HNF-4 alpha gene is localized on chromosome 20q. Similar clinical characteristics apply to the MODY3 form, however the latter is much more frequent among early onset, autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes (20-40%). HNF-1 alpha gene is localized on chromosome 12q. HNF-1 beta (MODY5 locus on chromosome 17q) is a protein which forms heterodimers with HNF-1 alpha. This rare form of diabetes has a clinical picture similar to MODY1 and MODY3. It is sometimes accompanied by symptoms of early kidney damage which are independent from diabetes. The other two transcription factors responsible for the development of autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes are proteins which bind directly to the insulin promoter. MODY4 (IPF-1, chromosome 13q) is a rare form and of a typical middle and late onset type 2 diabetes. BETA 2/Neurod1 has been recently associated with MODY by Dr Krolewski's group from Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA. BETA 2 is responsible for about 2% of autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes. The clinical characteristics depend on the localization of the mutations in the specific functional domains of the protein. Mutations identified in the glucokinase gene are associated with the MODY2 form. Glucokinase is an enzyme involved in the first level of glucose metabolism in b-cells-enzymatic phosphorylation. MODY2 is a modest form of diabetes. It is characterized by mild hyper-glycemia, mainly fasting, and the chronic complications are very rare. Glucokinase gene is localized on chromosome 7p. It is expected that in the nearest future more type 2 susceptibility genes will be identified.

11296231|t|Transcription factor-dependent regulation of CBP and P/CAF histone acetyltransferase activity.
11296231|a|CREB-binding protein (CBP) and CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) are coactivators possessing an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. They are positioned at promoter regions via association with sequence-specific DNA-binding factors and stimulate transcription in a gene-specific manner. The current view suggests that coactivator function depends mainly on the strength and specificity of transcription factor-coactivator interactions. Here we show that two dominant-negative mutants of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), P447L and P519L, occurring in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) patients, exhibit paradoxically stronger interactions than the wild-type protein with either CBP or P/CAF. However, CBP and P/CAF recruited by these mutants lack HAT activity. In contrast, wild-type HNF-1alpha and other transcription factors, such as Sp1 or HNF-4, stimulated the HAT activity of CBP. The results suggest a more dynamic role for DNA-binding proteins in the transcription process than was considered previously. They are not only required for the recruitment of coactivators to the promoter but they may also modulate their enzymatic activity.

11315828|t|Familial early-onset type 2 diabetes in Chinese patients: obesity and genetics have more significant roles than autoimmunity.
11315828|a|OBJECTIVE: We examined the prevalence of different forms of diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese patients with familial early-onset type 2 diabetes and compared their clinical features with patients with familial late-onset type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 145 young patients with early-onset diabetes (age and age at diagnosis &lt; or = 40 years) and a family history of diabetes were studied. They were screened for mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, and HNF-1alpha. The mitochondrial DNA A--&gt;G at nucleotide 3243 (mt3243) and amyLin S20G mutations were studied, and antibodies to GAD (anti-GADs) were also examined. RESULTS: The prevalence of putative diabetogenic gene mutations and autoimmune markers were 4% for glucokinase, 0% for HNF-4alpha, 5% for HNF-1alpha, 3% for mt3243, 2% for amylin 520G, and 4% for anti-GAD. Compared with late-onset patients, the patients with early-onset diabetes had a higher prevalence of a parental history of diabetes and were generally more obese. When classified by obesity indexes (BMI and waist circumference), the obese patients, especially those with early-onset diabetes, had a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and increased rates of retinopathy and albuminuria. CONCLUSIONS; Genetic factors (up to 14%) and obesity (55%) play more significant roles than autoimmunity (4%) in familial type 2 diabetes in young Chinese patients. The significance of obesity-related genes and other gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in these young patients remains to be determined.

11393552|t|Diagnosis of MODY in the offspring of parents with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
11393552|a|Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant monogenic form of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) representing 5% of youth-onset DM in the Caucasian population. In young adults the disease can be present as either non-insulin dependent or insulin-dependent DM. The diagnosis of this genetic disorder in children and adolescents is rare because of the mild glucose metabolism disorder at this time. We performed a metabolic, autoimmune and genetic study in 40 offspring of young parents affected by insulin-dependent DM (Group A) and in 35 offspring of young parents affected by early-onset non-insulin-dependent DM (Group B). Two children of Group A (5%) were found to be affected by fasting hyperglycemia and carry a GCK gene mutation that in one case was present also in the diabetic father. Eighteen offspring of Group B (51%) were positive for GCK or HNF-1alpha gene mutations present in the affected parents. All but two of these young patients had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Eleven of them were younger than 16 years. We conclude that screening for DM in youth should be extended to MODY in young families with both non-insulin-dependent and insulin-dependent DM. The sensitivity of the metabolic tests will precede the genetic diagnosis.

11440371|t|Routine mutation screening of HNF-1alpha and GCK genes in MODY diagnosis: how effective are the techniques of DHPLC and direct sequencing used in combination?
11440371|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and glucokinase (GCK) genes are the major causes of monogenic forms of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young subtypes, MODY). We evaluated the effectiveness of fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism (F-SSCP), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing based mutation detection in the molecular diagnosis of MODY. Our goal is to identify a rapid, efficient and cost effective mutation detection method for the molecular diagnosis of MODY and other human genetic disorders. METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of DHPLC in screening for MODY 2 and 3 mutations. In addition, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, cost, handling time and analysis time of fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing screening methods. RESULTS: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography is a recently developed method for mutation detection. It is cost effective, powerful and reliable and quite suitable for 22 out of the 24 fragments required for MODY 2 and 3 testing. However, exons 1 and 7 of the HNF-1alpha gene are very polymorphic and so direct sequencing is faster as well as more efficient and reliable. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that combining denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing is a good approach for the routine detection of HNF-1alpha and GCK mutations in MODY families. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography appears to be a powerful tool in genetic testing and the method could be applied to the molecular diagnosis of other human genetic diseases.

11463573|a|Mutations in the human genes encoding the tissue-specific transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha, HNF1beta and HNF4alpha are responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic dominant inherited form of diabetes mellitus characterized by defective insulin secretion of the pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, the mutated HNF1beta gene causes defective development of the kidney and genital malformation. This review summarizes the main features of these transcription factors and discusses potential events leading to the specific disease phenotypes.

11522670|t|The generalized aminoaciduria seen in patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha mutations is a feature of all patients with diabetes and is associated with glucosuria.
11522670|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) mutations are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. HNF-1alpha homozygous knockout mice exhibit a renal Fanconi syndrome with glucosuria and generalized aminoaciduria in addition to diabetes. We investigated glucosuria and aminoaciduria in patients with HNF-1alpha mutations. Sixteen amino acids were measured in urine samples from patients with HNF-1alpha mutations, age-matched nondiabetic control subjects, and age-matched type 1 diabetic patients, type 2 diabetic patients, and patients with diabetes and chronic renal failure. The HNF-1alpha patients had glucosuria at lower glycemic control (as shown by HbA1c) than type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, consistent with a lower renal glucose threshold. The HNF-1alpha patients had a generalized aminoaciduria with elevated levels of 14 of 16 amino acids and an increased mean Z score for all amino acids compared with control subjects (0.66 vs. 0.00; P &lt; 0.0005). Generalized aminoaciduria was also present in type 1 diabetic (Z score, 0.80; P &lt; 0.0001), type 2 diabetic (Z score, 0.71; P &lt; 0.0002), and chronic renal failure (Z score, 0.65; P &lt; 0.01) patients. Aminoaciduria was not associated with microalbuminuria or proteinuria but was associated with glucosuria (1.00 glucosuria vs. 0.19 no glucosuria; P = 0.002). In type 1 diabetic patients, urine samples taken on the same day showed significantly more aminoaciduria when glucosuria was present compared with when it was absent (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, HNF-1alpha mutation carriers have a mutation-specific defect of proximal tubular glucose transport, resulting in increased glucosuria. In contrast, the generalized aminoaciduria seen in patients with HNF-1alpha mutations is a general feature of patients with diabetes and glucosuria. Glucose may depolarize and dissipate the electrical gradient of the sodium-dependent amino acid transporters in the proximal renal tubule, causing a reduction in amino acid resorption.

11554773|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young: from clinical description to molecular genetic characterization.
11554773|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited, young-onset beta-cell disorders. At least two consecutive generations are affected with a family member diagnosed before 25 years of age. Diabetes is caused either by mutations in the glucokinase gene (glucokinase MODY) or by mutations in transcription factors (transcription factor MODY). Glucokinase maturity-onset diabetes of the young is a mild, non-progressive hyperglycaemia caused by a resetting of the pancreatic glucose sensor. It is treated with diet, and complications are rare. Pregnancies affected by glucokinase mutations have specific management strategies and prognosis. Transcription factor maturity-onset diabetes of the young, caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor genes HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and HNF-1beta, and in insulin promoter factor-1 results in a progressive beta-cell defect with increasing treatment requirements and diabetic complications. Cystic renal disease is a prominent feature of HNF-1beta mutations. Further maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes remain to be identified. MODY is part of the differential diagnosis of diabetes presenting in the first to third decades of life. Diagnostic molecular genetic testing is available for the more common genes involved.

11562418|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta: a new kindred with renal cysts and diabetes and gene expression in normal human development.
11562418|a|The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1beta) transcription factor controls endoderm development. Human mutations cause early-onset diabetes mellitus and have recently been associated with dysplastic, hypoplastic, and glomerulocystic kidneys. A new kindred with this "renal cysts and diabetes" syndrome is described, and nephrogenic HNF-1beta expression is defined. The proband had congenital cystic kidneys: over the next 12 yr, his renal function was impaired, but he was normoglycemic. His mother developed diabetes during pregnancy: renal ultrasonography at age 24 yr was normal, but she subsequently developed cysts. Both subjects have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in HNF-1beta that results from a 1-bp insertion in exon 5 (Y352fsinsA). When reverse-transcription PCR and in situ hybridization were used, HNF-1beta mRNA was detected in normal human metanephroi, with the highest levels of transcripts localized to fetal medullary and cortical collecting ducts and low levels of expression in nephrogenic cortex mesenchyme, primitive nephron tubules, and immature glomeruli. These results constitute the first demonstration of HNF-1beta expression during human nephrogenesis and emphasize a disease spectrum associated with HNF-1beta mutation.

11668618|t|Analysis of a non-functional HNF-1alpha (TCF1) mutation in Japanese subjects with familial type 1 diabetes.
11668618|a|Mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha; gene symbol TCF1) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), a form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset, and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Recent genetic studies, however, also found mutations in patients diagnosed with idiopathic (non-autoimmune based) type 1 diabetes. We identified a novel frameshift mutation (142delG) in the TCF1 gene in a family with a strong family history of type 1 diabetes and examined the functional properties of the mutant HNF 1alpha. The expression of the mutant protein was not detected in COS-7 cells by Western blot analysis after transfection of the mutant cDNA. This is the first case of an unstable mutant HNF-1alpha protein. Reporter gene analysis indicated that the mutant HNF-1alpha had no transactivation activity in HeLa and MIN6 cells. Haploinsufficiency for HNF-1alpha may lead to severe forms of diabetes like type 1 diabetes.

11692182|t|Early-onset Type II diabetes mellitus in Italian families due to mutations in the genes encoding hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha and glucokinase.
11692182|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Maturity-onset-diabetes of the young (MODY) is caused by mutations in at least five different genes. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of the most common MODY genes in Italian families with early-onset Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We screened 28 Italian early-onset Type II diabetic families (diagnosis &lt; 35 years) for mutations in the hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha, (MODY1), glucokinase (MODY2) and hepatic nuclear factor-1 alpha (MODY3). Both strands of exons, flanking introns and minimal promoter regions of the above-mentioned genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and were sequenced directly. RESULTS: We identified four different mutations, three of which are not described, (W113X, G42P43fsCC --&gt; A, H514R) and four new polymorphisms (G184G, T513T, IVS3-nt47delG, IVS1- nt53C --&gt; G) in the hepatic nuclear factor-1 alpha gene, two new potential mutations (G44S, IVS4nt + 7C --&gt; T) and three new polymorphisms (promoter-nt84C --&gt; G, IVS9 + nt8C --&gt; T, IVS9 + nt49G --&gt; A) in the glucokinase gene, and a new polymorphism (IVS1c-nt11T --&gt; G) in the hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha gene. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the hepatic nuclear factor-1 alpha and glucokinase are associated with Type II diabetes in 14 % and 7 % of Italian families, respectively. Our findings provide an impetus for screening Italian MODY and early-non Type II diabetic families for mutations in the above mentioned genes to identify relatives at risk who could benefit from primary prevention care.
