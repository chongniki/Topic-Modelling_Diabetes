12063257|t|Activation of the beta-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway is obligate for formation of primitive endoderm by mouse F9 totipotent teratocarcinoma cells in response to retinoic acid.
12063257|a|The morphogen retinoic acid promotes the formation of primitive endoderm in mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells as does the stimulation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. We investigated whether the beta-catenin/Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcriptional pathway activated by Frizzled-1 plays a role in the retinoic acid-induced pathway to primitive endoderm formation. An analysis of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription reveals increased transcription at 1 and 4 h post-treatment with retinoic acid. The stimulation of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription as well as the formation of primitive endoderm was accompanied by the stabilization of beta-catenin as observed in activation of the Frizzled-1 pathway. Transient transfection of F9 cells with an expression vector harboring a dominant-negative mutant of Tcf4 resulted in the attenuation of both the increase in Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription and formation of primitive endoderm in response to the morphogen. Clones stably transfected to express the dominant-negative Tcf4 displayed a block in retinoic acid-induced activation of Lef-Tcf-sensitive transcription and primitive endoderm formation. These data reveal the obligate role of the beta-catenin/Lef-Tcf transcriptional pathway in the action of the morphogen retinoic acid.

16415884|t|Variant of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers risk of type 2 diabetes.
16415884|a|We have previously reported suggestive linkage of type 2 diabetes mellitus to chromosome 10q. We genotyped 228 microsatellite markers in Icelandic individuals with type 2 diabetes and controls throughout a 10.5-Mb interval on 10q. A microsatellite, DG10S478, within intron 3 of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2; formerly TCF4) was associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 2.1 x 10(-9)). This was replicated in a Danish cohort (P = 4.8 x 10(-3)) and in a US cohort (P = 3.3 x 10(-9)). Compared with non-carriers, heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the at-risk alleles (38% and 7% of the population, respectively) have relative risks of 1.45 and 2.41. This corresponds to a population attributable risk of 21%. The TCF7L2 gene product is a high mobility group box-containing transcription factor previously implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. It is thought to act through regulation of proglucagon gene expression in enteroendocrine cells via the Wnt signaling pathway.

16772326|t|Limited role for SREBP-1c in defective glucose-induced insulin secretion from Zucker diabetic fatty rat islets: a functional and gene profiling analysis.
16772326|a|Accumulation of intracellular lipid may contribute to defective insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes. Although Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF; fa/fa) rat islets are fat-laden and overexpress the lipogenic master gene, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), the contribution of SREBP-1c to the secretory defects observed in this model remains unclear. Here we compare the gene expression profile of lean control (fa/+) and ZDF rat islets in the absence or presence of dominant-negative SREBP-1c (SREBP-1c DN). ZDF islets displayed elevated basal insulin secretion at 3 mmol/l glucose but a severely depressed response to 17 mmol/l glucose. While SREBP-1c DN reduced basal insulin secretion from ZDF islets, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was not improved. Of 57 genes differentially regulated in ZDF islets and implicated in glucose metabolism, vesicle trafficking, ion fluxes, and/or exocytosis, 21 were upregulated and 5 were suppressed by SREBP-1c DN. Genes underrepresented in ZDF islets were either unaffected (Glut-2, Kir6.2, Rab3), stimulated (voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel subunit alpha1D, CPT2, SUR2, rab9, syt13), or inhibited (syntaxin 7, secretogranin-2) by SREBP-1c inhibition. Correspondingly, SREBP-1c DN largely corrected decreases in the expression of the transcription factors Pdx-1 and MafA but did not affect the abnormalities in Pax6, Arx, hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1alpha), HNF3beta/Forkhead box-a2 (Foxa2), inducible cyclic AMP early repressor (ICER), or transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) expression observed in ZDF islets. We conclude that upregulation of SREBP-1c and mild increases in triglyceride content do not explain defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from ZDF rats. However, overexpression of SREBP-1c may contribute to enhanced basal insulin secretion in this model.

There are other convincing examples in the last 12 months: age-related macular degeneration (CFH), type 1 diabetes (IL2RA, also known as CD25) and type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2).

16855264|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms and progression to diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program.
16855264|a|BACKGROUND: Common polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been associated with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether the two most strongly associated variants (rs12255372 and rs7903146) predict the progression to diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance who were enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which lifestyle intervention or treatment with metformin was compared with placebo. METHODS: We genotyped these variants in 3548 participants and performed Cox regression analysis using genotype, intervention, and their interactions as predictors. We assessed the effect of genotype on measures of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at baseline and at one year. RESULTS: Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at rs7903146 were more likely to have progression from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001). The effect of genotype was stronger in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.70; P=0.004) than in the metformin and lifestyle-intervention groups (hazard ratios, 1.62 and 1.15, respectively; P for the interaction between genotype and intervention not significant). The TT genotype was associated with decreased insulin secretion but not increased insulin resistance at baseline. Similar results were obtained for rs12255372. CONCLUSIONS: Common variants in TCF7L2 seem to be associated with an increased risk of diabetes among persons with impaired glucose tolerance. The risk-conferring genotypes in TCF7L2 are associated with impaired beta-cell function but not with insulin resistance. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00004992. [ClinicalTrials.gov]).

16936215|t|Association analysis of 6,736 U.K. subjects provides replication and confirms TCF7L2 as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene with a substantial effect on individual risk.
16936215|a|Recent data suggest that common variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with type 2 diabetes. Evaluation of such associations in independent samples provides necessary replication and a robust assessment of effect size. Using four TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; including the two most associated in the previous study), we conducted a case-control study in 2,158 type 2 diabetic subjects and 2,574 control subjects and a family-based association analysis in 388 parent-offspring trios all from the U.K. All SNPs showed powerful associations with diabetes in the case-control analysis, with strongest effects at rs7903146 (allele-wise relative risk 1.36 [95% CI 1.24-1.48], P = 1.3 x 10(-11)). Data were consistent with a multiplicative model. The family-based analyses provided independent evidence for association at all loci (e.g., rs4506565, 62% transmission, P = 7 x 10(-5)) with no parent-of-origin effects. The frequency of diabetes-associated TCF7L2 genotypes was greater in cases ascertained for positive family history and early onset (rs4606565, P = 0.02); the population-attributable risk, estimated from the least-selected cases, is approximately 16%. The overall evidence for association for these variants (P = 4.4 x 10(-14) combining case-control and family-based analyses for rs4506565) exceeds genome-wide significance criteria and clearly establishes TCF7L2 as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene of substantial importance.

16936216|t|Variant of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and the risk of type 2 diabetes in large cohorts of U.S. women and men.
16936216|a|Emerging evidence indicates that variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In a prospective, nested, case-control study (n = 3,520) within the Nurses' Health Study (687 type 2 diabetic case and 1,051 control subjects) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (886 case and 896 control subjects), we examined the association of a common variant of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 [T/G]) with type 2 diabetes risk among Caucasians. Frequencies of the T-allele were significantly higher among case than control subjects; each copy of the T-allele was associated with a 1.32-fold (P = 0.0002) and 1.53-fold (P < 0.0001) increased type 2 diabetes risk in women and men, respectively. The odds ratios (95% CI) associated with homozygous carriers of the T-allele were 1.86 (1.30-2.67) and 2.15 (1.48-3.13) in women and men, respectively. Population-attributable risks for diabetes associated with the T-allele were 14.8 and 22.3% for women and men, respectively. In a meta-analysis of 3,347 case and 3,947 control subjects, each copy of the T-allele was associated with a 1.48-fold increased risk (P < 10(-16)). Our findings confirm that the TCF7L2 gene represents an important locus for predicting inherited susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

16936217|t|Association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants with type 2 diabetes in a Finnish sample.
16936217|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is part of the Wnt signaling pathway. Genetic variants within TCF7L2 on chromosome 10q were recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and American (U.S.) samples. We previously observed a modest logarithm of odds score of 0.61 on chromosome 10q, approximately 1 Mb from TCF7L2, in the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics study. We tested the five associated TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in a Finnish sample of 1,151 type 2 diabetic patients and 953 control subjects. We confirmed the association with the same risk allele (P value <0.05) for all five SNPs. Our strongest results were for rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.36 [95% CI 1.15-1.61], P = 0.00026) and rs7903146 (1.33 [1.14-1.56], P = 0.00042). Based on the CEU HapMap data, we selected and tested 12 additional SNPs to tag SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs12255372. None of these SNPs showed stronger evidence of association than rs12255372 or rs7903146 (OR < or =1.26, P > or = 0.0054). Our results strengthen the evidence that one or more variants in TCF7L2 are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

16936218|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. The TCF7L2 gene is located on chromosome 10q25 in a region of replicated linkage to type 2 diabetes. Recently, a microsatellite marker in intron 3 (DG10S478) and five correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in Icelandic individuals that showed strong association with type 2 diabetes, which was replicated in Danish and European-American cohorts. We genotyped four of the SNPs (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) in Amish subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 137), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n = 139), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 342). We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with type 2 diabetes with those with NGT and found marginal association for rs7901695 (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51); comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined type 2 diabetes/IGT case group showed strong association with rs7901695 and rs7903146 (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with rs11196205 and rs12255372 (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively). In an expanded set of 698 Amish subjects without diabetes, we found no association with insulin and glucose levels during a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. We also genotyped these SNPs in nondiabetic, non-Amish subjects (n = 48), in whom intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed, and found an association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively) and disposition index (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively). These data provide replicating evidence that variants in TCF7L2 increase the risk for type 2 diabetes and novel evidence that the variants likely influence both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.

16951059|t|High-resolution quantitative trait locus analysis reveals multiple diabetes susceptibility loci mapped to intervals<800 kb in the species-conserved Niddm1i of the GK rat.
16951059|a|Niddm1i, a 16-Mb locus within the major diabetes QTL in the diabetic GK rat, causes impaired glucose tolerance in the congenic NIDDM1I strain. Niddm1i is homologous to both human and mouse regions linked with type 2 diabetes susceptibility. We employed multiple QTL analyses of congenic F2 progeny selected for one recombination event within Niddm1i combined with characterization of subcongenic strains. Fine mapping located one hyperglycemia locus within 700 kb (Niddm1i4, P=5x10(-6)). Two adjacent loci were also detected, and the GK allele at Niddm1i2 (500 kb) showed a glucose-raising effect, whereas it had a glucose-lowering effect at Niddm1i3 (400 kb). Most proximally, Niddm1i1 (800 kb) affecting body weight was identified. Experimental data from subcongenics supported the four loci. Sorcs1, one of the two known diabetes susceptibility genes in the region, resides within Niddm1i3, while Tcf7l2 maps outside all four loci. Multiple-marker QTL analysis incorporating the effect of cosegregating QTL as cofactors together with genetically selected progeny can remarkably enhance resolution of QTL. The data demonstrate that the species-conserved Niddm1i is a composite of at least four QTL affecting type 2 diabetes susceptibility and that two adjacent QTL (Niddm1i2GK and Niddm1i3GK) act in opposite directions.

17003358|t|Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2 are reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes and reduce the insulin response to glucose in nondiabetic individuals.
17003358|a|Recently, common noncoding variants in the TCF7L2 gene were strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in samples from Iceland, Denmark, and the U.S. We genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across TCF7L2 in 8,310 individuals in family-based and case-control designs from Scandinavia, Poland, and the U.S. We convincingly confirmed the previous association of TCF7L2 SNPs with the risk of type 2 diabetes (rs7903146T odds ratio 1.40 [95% CI 1.30-1.50], P = 6.74 x 10(-20)). In nondiabetic individuals, the risk genotypes were associated with a substantial reduction in the insulinogenic index derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (risk allele homozygotes have half the insulin response to glucose of noncarriers, P = 0.003) but not with increased insulin resistance. These results suggest that TCF7L2 variants may act through insulin secretion to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.

17003360|t|Transcription factor TCF7L2 genetic study in the French population: expression in human beta-cells and adipose tissue and strong association with type 2 diabetes.
17003360|a|Recently, the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been associated with type 2 diabetes in subjects of European origin in the DeCode study. We genotyped the two most associated variants (rs7903146 and rs12255372) in 2,367 French type 2 diabetic subjects and in 2,499 control subjects. Both the T-allele of rs7903146 and the T-allele of rs12255372 significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95% CI 1.55-1.83) (P = 6.0 x 10(-35)) and 1.60 (1.47-1.74) (P = 7.6 x 10(-28)), respectively. In nonobese type 2 diabetic subjects (BMI <30 kg/m2, n = 1,346), the ORs increased to 1.89 (1.72-2.09) (P = 2.1 x 10(-38)) and 1.79 (1.62-1.97) (P = 5.7 x 10(-31)), respectively. The rs7903146 T at-risk allele associates with decreased BMI and earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 8.0 x 10(-3) and P = 3.8 x 10(-4), respectively), which is supported by quantitative family-based association tests. TCF7L2 is expressed in most human tissues, including mature pancreatic beta-cells, with the exception of the skeletal muscle. In the subcutaneous and omental fat from obese type 2 diabetic subjects, TCF7L2 expression significantly decreased compared with obese normoglycemic individuals. During rat fetal beta-cell differentiation, TCF7L2 expression pattern mimics the key marker NGN3 (neurogenin 3), suggesting a role in islet development. These data provide evidence that TCF7L2 is a major determinant of type 2 diabetes risk in European populations and suggests that this transcription factor plays a key role in glucose homeostasis.

17020404|t|Combining information from common type 2 diabetes risk polymorphisms improves disease prediction.
17020404|a|BACKGROUND: A limited number of studies have assessed the risk of common diseases when combining information from several predisposing polymorphisms. In most cases, individual polymorphisms only moderately increase risk (approximately 20%), and they are thought to be unhelpful in assessing individuals' risk clinically. The value of analyzing multiple alleles simultaneously is not well studied. This is often because, for any given disease, very few common risk alleles have been confirmed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three common variants (Lys23 of KCNJ11, Pro12 of PPARG, and the T allele at rs7903146 of TCF7L2) have been shown to predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.30 to 0.88 in controls. To assess the combined effect of multiple susceptibility alleles, we genotyped these variants in a large case-control study (3,668 controls versus 2,409 cases). Individual allele odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.23) to 1.48 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.60). We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction, and the risks of multiple alleles were consistent with a multiplicative model. Each additional risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with all six risk alleles had an OR of 5.71 (95% CI, 1.15 to 28.3) compared to those with no risk alleles. The 8.1% of participants that were double-homozygous for the risk alleles at TCF7L2 and Pro12Ala had an OR of 3.16 (95% CI, 2.22 to 4.50), compared to 4.3% with no TCF7L2 risk alleles and either no or one Glu23Lys or Pro12Ala risk alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Combining information from several known common risk polymorphisms allows the identification of population subgroups with markedly differing risks of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those obtained using single polymorphisms. This approach may have a role in future preventative measures for common, polygenic diseases.

17031610|t|Association of variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Dutch Breda cohort.
17031610|a|AIM/HYPOTHESIS: A strong association between susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and common variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), encoding an enteroendocrine transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis, has been reported in three different populations (Iceland, Denmark and USA) by Grant et al. We aimed to replicate these findings in a Dutch cohort. METHODS: We analysed the genotypes of two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 gene in 502 unrelated type 2 diabetes patients and in a set of healthy controls (n = 920). The two SNPs showed almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.91). RESULTS: We were able to replicate the previously reported association in our Breda cohort. The minor alleles of both variants were significantly over-represented in cases (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, [Formula: see text] for rs12255372; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19-1.66, [Formula: see text] for rs7903146). In addition, TCF7L2 haplotypes were analysed for association with the disease. The analysis of haplotypes did not reveal any strong association beyond that expected from analysing individual SNPs. The TT haplotype carrying the minor alleles was more frequent among cases (OR 1.38, [Formula: see text]). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data strongly confirm that variants of the TCF7L2 gene contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. The population-attributable risk from this factor in the Dutch type 2 diabetes population is 10%.

17065361|t|TCF7L2 variation predicts hyperglycemia incidence in a French general population: the data from an epidemiological study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) study.
17065361|a|Recently, case-control studies demonstrated that a TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 gene) noncoding variant (rs7903146 T at-risk allele) was strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the predictive value of this marker in a nonselected general population remains unknown. In this study, our aim was to assess the contribution of this variant to the prevalence and incidence of hyperglycemia (type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose) and insulin regulation in a 9-year prospective study of 4,976 middle-aged participants in the French DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort. Our data support previous studies associating the T at-risk allele with a higher prevalence of hyperglycemia at baseline (P = 0.049) and a higher incidence of hyperglycemia after 9 years of follow-up (P = 0.014). The population-attributable risk to develop hyperglycemia due to the T at-risk allele was estimated to be 10.4% at the end of the prospective study. The most likely inheritance model was found to be additive (P = 0.002) rather than deviating from linearity (hazard ratio 1.21 [95% CI 1.05-1.39], P = 0.008) [corrected] An increase in the incidence of hyperglycemia was confirmed by survival analyses among C/C, C/T, and T/T carriers during the 9 years of follow-up (P = 0.028 by log-rank test). Interestingly, in control individuals, there was weak evidence of association of the T at-risk allele with reduced fasting insulin levels and insulin secretion index (homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function) in control individuals. We conclude that the TCF7L2 T at-risk allele variation (rs7903146) predicts hyperglycemia incidence in a general French population, possibly through a deleterious effect on insulin secretion.

17093941|t|Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Indian population.
17093941|a|AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS: India has the greatest number of diabetic subjects in any one country, but the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in India is poorly understood. Common non-coding variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have recently been strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in European populations. We investigated whether TCF7L2 variants are also associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped type 2 diabetes patients (n = 955) and ethnically matched control subjects (n = 399) by sequencing three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs4506565) in TCF7L2. RESULTS: We observed a strong association with all the polymorphisms, including rs12255372 (odds ratio [OR] 1.50 [95% CI = 1.24-1.82], p = 4.0 x 10(-5)), rs4506565 (OR 1.48 [95% CI = 1.24-1.77], p = 2.0 x 10(-5)) and rs7903146 (OR 1.46 [95% CI = 1.22-1.75], p = 3.0 x 10(-5)). All three variants showed increased relative risk when homozygous rather than heterozygous, with the strongest risk for rs12255372 (OR 2.28 [95% CI = 1.40-3.72] vs OR 1.43 [95% CI = 1.11-1.83]). We found no association of the TCF7L2 genotypes with age at diagnosis, BMI or WHR, but the risk genotype at rs12255372 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.001), higher 2-h plasma glucose (p = 0.0002) and higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p = 0.012) in non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study in Indian subjects replicates the strong association of TCF7L2 variants with type 2 diabetes in other populations. It also provides evidence that variations in TCF7L2 may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by influencing both insulin secretion and insulin resistance. TCF7L2 is an important gene for determining susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus and it transgresses the boundaries of ethnicity.

17109766|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variant is associated with familial breast cancer risk: a case-control study.
17109766|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a critical component of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Aberrant TCF7L2 expression modifies Wnt signaling and mediates oncogenic effects through the upregulation of c-MYC and cyclin D. Genetic alterations in TCF7L2 may therefore affect cancer risk. Recently, TCF7L2 variants, including the microsatellite marker DG10S478 and the nearly perfectly linked SNP rs12233372, were identified to associate with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 rs12255372 variant on familial breast cancer (BC) risk by means of TaqMan allelic discrimination, analyzing BRCA1/2 mutation-negative index patients of 592 German BC families and 735 control individuals. RESULTS: The T allele of rs12255372 showed an association with borderline significance (OR = 1.19, 95% C.I. = 1.01-1.42, P = 0.04), and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend revealed an allele dose-dependent association of rs12255372 with BC risk (Ptrend = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a possible influence of TCF7L2 rs12255372 on the risk of familial BC.

17130514|t|Polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with reduced insulin secretion in nondiabetic women.
17130514|a|Recently, the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene on chromosome 10q25.2 has been linked with type 2 diabetes among Caucasians, with disease associations noted for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12255372 and rs7903146. To investigate mechanisms by which TCF7L2 could contribute to type 2 diabetes, we examined the effects of these SNPs on clinical and metabolic traits affecting glucose homeostasis in 256 nondiabetic female subjects (138 European Americans and 118 African Americans) aged 7-57 years. Outcomes included BMI, percent body fat, insulin sensitivity (S(i)), acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(g)), and the disposition index (DI). Homozygosity for the minor allele (TT) of SNP rs12255372 occurred in 9% of individuals and was associated with a 31% reduction in DI values in a recessive model. The at-risk allele TT was also associated with lower AIR(g) adjusted for S(i) in both ethnic groups, whereas rs12255372 genotype was not associated with measures of adiposity or with S(i). The T allele of rs12255372 was also associated with increased prevalence of impaired fasting glucose. Genotypes at rs7903146 were not associated with any metabolic trait. Lower S(i) and higher AIR(g) observed in the African-American compared with the European-American subgroup could not be explained by the TCF7L2 genotype. Our data suggest that the TCF7L2 gene is an important factor regulating insulin secretion, which could explain its association with type 2 diabetes.

17181866|t|Effects of the diabetes linked TCF7L2 polymorphism in a representative older population.
17181866|a|BACKGROUND: A polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been found to be associated with type 2 diabetes in case-control studies. We aimed to estimate associations of the marker rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism with fasting glucose, lipids, diabetes prevalence and complications in an older general population. METHODS: In total, 944 subjects aged > or = 65 years from the population representative InCHIANTI study were enrolled in this study. Those with fasting blood glucose of > or = 7 mmol/l or physician diagnosis were considered diabetic. Cut-off points for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were > or = 5.6 mmol/l to < 7 mmol/l. RESULTS: In the general population sample, minor (T) allele carriers of rs7903146 had higher fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.028) but lower fasting insulin (p = 0.030) and HOMA2b scores (p = 0.001), suggesting poorer beta-cell function. T allele carriers also had smaller waist circumference (p = 0.009), lower triglyceride levels (p = 0.006), and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.008). The prevalence of diabetes or IFG was 32.4% in TT carriers and 23.3% in CC carriers; adjusted OR = 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.65, p = 0.031). Within the diabetic and IFG groups, fewer T allele carriers had metabolic syndrome features (p = 0.047) or had experienced a myocardial infarction (p = 0.037). Conversely, T allele carriers with diabetes had poorer renal function (reduced 24-hour creatinine clearance, p = 0.013), and possibly more retinopathy (p = 0.067). Physician-diagnosed dementia was more common in the T carriers (in diabetes p = 0.05, with IFG p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is associated with lower insulin levels, smaller waist circumference, and lower risk lipid profiles in the general elderly population. Patients with diabetes who are carriers of the minor allele are less likely to have metabolic-syndrome features, but may experience more microvascular complications, although the number of cases was small. If replicated, these findings may have implications for developing treatment approaches tailored by genotype.

17206141|t|Refining the impact of TCF7L2 gene variants on type 2 diabetes and adaptive evolution.
17206141|a|We recently described an association between risk of type 2diabetes and variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2; formerly TCF4), with a population attributable risk (PAR) of 17%-28% in three populations of European ancestry. Here, we refine the definition of the TCF7L2 type 2diabetes risk variant, HapB(T2D), to the ancestral T allele of a SNP, rs7903146, through replication in West African and Danish type 2 diabetes case-control studies and an expanded Icelandic study. We also identify another variant of the same gene, HapA, that shows evidence of positive selection in East Asian, European and West African populations. Notably, HapA shows a suggestive association with body mass index and altered concentrations of the hunger-satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin in males, indicating that the selective advantage of HapA may have been mediated through effects on energy metabolism.

17226113|t|Variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes but not with the metabolic syndrome in the MONICA/KORA surveys.
17226113|a|Recently, significant associations between common variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene ( TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes have been reported. This study was designed to replicate the reported associations of the two highly correlated (r (2)=0.86) TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs12255372 and rs7903146 with type 2 diabetes in a case-control study of 2369 MONICA/KORA participants (678 cases/1691 controls from Augsburg, Germany). To further investigate the pathogenic mechanism underlying these associations, we extended our analyses to the metabolic syndrome (IDF, NCEP definitions) and its components in a population-based study comprising 1404 male and female KORA participants aged 55-74 years. Results of our analyses strongly confirmed the minor T alleles as risk variants for type 2 diabetes (rs7903146: OR (TvsC) [95% CI]=1.36 [1.18;1.58], p=0.00003, and rs12255372: OR (TvsG) [95% CI]=1.31 [1.13;1.51], p=0.0003). Moreover, the T allele at rs7903146 was inversely associated with log-transformed, HOMA-%B (beta=-0.07, p=0.005) as a measure of basal insulin secretion, and log-transformed fasting insulin (beta=-0.06, p=0.02). No association was found with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the metabolic syndrome. These findings support replication evidence that TCF7L2 variants increase type 2 diabetes risk. TCF7L2 may primarily affect pancreatic beta cell function.

17245407|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes in northern Sweden.
17245407|a|A recent study found association of one microsatellite and five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 3 of the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Icelandic, Danish and American populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate if those SNPs were associated to T2D in two (family- and population-based) cohorts from northern Sweden. We genotyped four of the associated SNPs in a case-control cohort consisting of 872 T2D cases and 857 controls matched with respect to age, sex and geographical origin and in a sample of 59 extended families (148 affected and 83 unaffected individuals). Here, we report replication of association between T2D and three SNPs in the case-control (rs7901695, P=0.003; rs7901346, P=0.00002; and rs12255372, P=0.000004) and two SNPs in the family-based (rs7901695, P=0.01 and rs7901346, P=0.04) samples from northern Sweden. This replication strengthens the evidence for involvement of TCF7L2 in T2D.

17245589|t|A genetic variation of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.
17245589|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: It has been suggested that transcription factor 7-like 2 protein (TCF7L2) plays an important role in glucose metabolism by regulating the production level of glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone which modifies glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Recently, variants of TCF7L2 gene were reported to confer an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in three different samples from European and European-origin populations. We studied whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 were associated with type 2 diabetes in samples from a Japanese population. METHODS: Five SNPs were genotyped in three different sample sets. Association with type 2 diabetes was investigated in each, as well as in combined sample sets. RESULTS: The SNP rs7903146 was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in the initial (p = 0.08) and two replication sample sets (p = 0.05 and 0.06). For the combined sample set, in which we successfully genotyped 1,174 type 2 diabetes patients and 823 control subjects, rs7903146 showed a significant association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio = 1.69 [95% CI 1.21-2.36], p = 0.002) with the same direction as the previous reports in samples from European and European-origin populations. SNPs rs7903146 and rs7901695 were in complete linkage disequilibrium. The rest of the five SNPs (rs7895340, rs11196205 and rs12255372) did not show any significant associations with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The consistent association between rs7903146 in TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes in different ethnic groups, including the Japanese population, suggests that TCF7L2 is a common susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes.

17259383|t|Haplotypes of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and its upstream region are associated with type 2 diabetes and age of onset in Mexican Americans.
17259383|a|TCF7L2 acts as both a repressor and transactivator of genes, as directed by the Wnt signaling pathway. Recently, several highly correlated sequence variants located within a haplotype block of the TCF7L2 gene were observed to associate with type 2 diabetes in three Caucasian cohorts. We previously reported linkage of type 2 diabetes in the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFADS) cohort consisting of extended pedigrees of Mexican Americans to the region of chromosome 10q harboring TCF7L2. We therefore genotyped 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from nine haplotype blocks across the gene in 545 SAFADS subjects (178 diabetic) to investigate their role in diabetes pathogenesis. We observed nominal association between four SNPs (rs10885390, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs3814573) in three haplotype blocks and type 2 diabetes, age at diagnosis, and 2-h glucose levels (P = 0.001-0.055). Furthermore, we identified a common protective haplotype defined by these four SNPs that was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and age at diagnosis (P = 4.2 x 10(-5), relative risk [RR] 0.69; P = 6.7 x 10(-6), respectively) and a haplotype that confers diabetes risk that contains the rare alleles at SNPs rs10885390 and rs12255372 (P = 0.02, RR 1.64). These data provide evidence that variation in the TCF7L2 genomic region may affect risk for type 2 diabetes in Mexican Americans, but the attributable risk may be lower than in Caucasian populations.

17293876|t|A genome-wide association study identifies novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes.
17293876|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were hitherto unknown. A systematic search for these variants was recently made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case-control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing beta-cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in beta-cell development or function (IDE-KIF11-HHEX and EXT2-ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits.

17311858|t|TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms confer an increased risk for early impairment of glucose metabolism and increased height in obese children.
17311858|a|CONTEXT: Variants in the transcription factor 7-like2 (TCF7L2) gene have been associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes in adults. To evaluate whether the five reported risk variants confer a higher risk for obesity and early impairment of glucose metabolism in children, we genotyped these risk variants of the TCF7L2 gene in a representative cohort of 1029 Caucasian children and an independent cohort of 283 obese children. RESULTS: Applying a case control design, we observed a significantly lower prevalence of the rs11196205 and rs7895340 risk alleles in the obese (n = 283) compared with lean (n = 672) children (0.40 vs. 0.45; P = 0.02). There was, however, no statistically significant relationship between these genotypes and quantitative traits of obesity in either a normal representative cohort (n = 1029) or an obesity cohort. Obese children were significantly taller than lean children. This increase in height was independently associated with risk variants of the TCF7L2 gene, whereas in the normal representative cohort height appeared to be decreased in carriers of the minor alleles. In the obese cohort, three risk alleles (rs7901695, rs7903146, and rs1225572) were significantly associated with higher fasting and 120-min blood glucose levels independent of sex, age, pubertal stage, and body mass index. Fasting and peak insulin levels and HOMA-IR appeared with a similar tendency but were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate for the first time that TCF7L2 gene variants confer an increased risk for early impairment of glucose metabolism in obese children, which is consistent with adult studies identifying TCF7L2 as a major diabetes susceptibility gene.

17317761|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus and interacts with adiposity to alter insulin secretion in Mexican Americans.
17317761|a|OBJECTIVE: Variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related quantitative traits. We examined variation in a 0.1-Mb region surrounding marker DG10S478 for association with diabetes-related quantitative traits in 132 Mexican-American families of a proband with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants were phenotyped by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an intravenous glucose tolerance test and by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan for percentage of body fat. Of the 42 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped, 15 were identified. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, none of the SNPs showed association with diabetes-related quantitative traits. However, rs12255372 showed association with 30' Deltainsulin (OGTT 30' min fasting insulin) in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.027). The effect of adiposity to increase 30' Deltainsulin was greater in subjects with the T allele. This interaction was not associated with acute insulin response to intravenous glucose. rs12255372 also showed an association with beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance based on 30' Deltainsulin in an interaction with percentage of body fat (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.014). rs12255372 was also associated with GDM (odds ratio [OR] 2.49 [95% CI 1.17-5.31]; P = 0.018) in our case-control sample. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that variation in TCF7L2 is associated with GDM and interacts with adiposity to alter insulin secretion in Mexican Americans. Our observations partly explain the increased ORs observed in previous associated studies when analyses were restricted to lean subjects and the variability in quantitative trait association results.

17317781|t|Negative regulation of c-Myc transcription by pancreas duodenum homeobox-1.
17317781|a|The pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 (Pdx1) is essential for pancreatic development and insulin gene transcription, whereas c-Myc has a deleterious effect on islet function. However, the relationship between c-Myc and Pdx1 is poorly concerned. Here we demonstrated that Pdx1 could suppress c-Myc promoter activity, which relied on T cell factor (Tcf) binding elements harbored in c-Myc promoter. Furthermore, the transcription activity of beta-catenin/Tcf was markedly decreased on Pdx1 expression, but cotransfection of Pdx1 short hairpin RNA abrogated this effect. Pdx1 expression did not induce beta-catenin degradation nor did it alter their subcellular distribution. The mutation analysis showed that the amino acids (1-209) of Pdx1 harboring an inhibitory domain, which might lead to the reduction of beta-catenin/Tcf/p300 complex levels and attenuate their binding activity with c-Myc promoter sequences. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated Pdx1 interference caused cell proliferation and cytokine-induced apoptosis via the dysregulation of c-Myc transcription. These results indicated that the Pdx1 functioned as a key regulator for maintenance of beta-cell function, at least in part, through controlling c-Myc expression and the loss of its regulatory function may be an alternative mechanism for beta-cell neogenesis and apoptosis found in diabetes.

17340123|t|Replication study for the association of TCF7L2 with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population.
17340123|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) has been shown to be strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in white populations. To further investigate the involvement of TCF7L2 in conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, we examined the association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analysed four SNPs (rs12255372, rs7903146, rs7901695 and rs11196205) and one tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism (DG10S478) in 1,630 Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1,064 control subjects. RESULTS: All investigated polymorphisms were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes, and rs12255372 showed the strongest association (T vs G, chi2 = 9.20, p = 0.0024, odds ratio = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.20-2.41), although the frequency of the risk allele in our population was much lower than that in white populations. The microsatellite polymorphism showed an almost complete linkage disequilibrium to rs1255372 when the alleles with longer repeats (+8, +12) were considered as minor alleles and showed an association with type 2 diabetes (chi2 = 5.34, p = 0.021, odds ratio = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.06-2.12). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that TCF7L2 might be a strong candidate for conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes across different ethnicities.

17342473|t|A variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.
17342473|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genetic and epidemiological studies suggest an association between gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes. Both are polygenic multifactorial disorders characterised by beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Our aim was to investigate whether common genetic variants that have previously been associated with type 2 diabetes or related phenotypes would also confer risk for gestational diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1,881 unrelated pregnant Scandinavian women (649 women with gestational diabetes mellitus, 1,232 non-diabetic control subjects) we genotyped the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2 rs7903146), adiponectin (ADIPOQ +276G > T), peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor, gamma 2 (PPARG Pro12Ala), PPARG-coactivator, 1 alpha (PPARGC1A Gly482Ser), forkhead box C2 (FOXC2 -512C > T) and beta3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3 Trp64Arg) polymorphisms using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay or RFLP. RESULTS: The CC, CT and TT genotype frequencies of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant differed significantly between women with gestational diabetes mellitus and control women (46.3, 43.6 and 10.1% vs 58.5, 35.3 and 6.2%, p = 3.7 x 10(-6), corrected p value [Pc] for multiple testing Pc = 2.2 x 10(-5)). The T-allele was associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 1.49 [95% CI 1.28-1.75], p = 4.9 x 10(-7) [Pc = 2.8 x 10(-6)]). Compared with wild-type CC-genotype carriers, heterozygous (CT-genotype) and homozygous (TT-genotype) carriers had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.26-1.93, p = 3.7 x 10(-5) [Pc = 0.0002]) and a 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.41-2.99, p = 0.0001 [Pc = 0.0008]) increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, respectively. The other polymorphisms studied were not significantly associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (ADIPOQ +276G > T: 1.17 [1.01-1.36], p = 0.039 [Pc = 0.23]; PPARG Pro12Ala: 1.06 [0.87-1.29], p = 0.53; PPARGC1A Gly482Ser: 0.96 [0.83-1.10], p = 0.54; FOXC2 -512C > T: 1.01 [0.87-1.16], p = 0.94; and ADRB3 Trp64Arg: 1.22 [0.95-1.56], p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in Scandinavian women.

17416797|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms modulate proinsulin levels and beta-cell function in a British Europid population.
17416797|a|Rapidly accumulating evidence shows that common T-cell transcription factor (TCF)7L2 polymorphisms confer risk of type 2 diabetes through unknown mechanisms. We examined the association between four TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs7903146, and measures of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in 1,697 Europid men and women of the population-based MRC (Medical Research Council)-Ely study. The T-(minor) allele of rs7903146 was strongly and positively associated with fasting proinsulin (P = 4.55 x 10(-9)) and 32,33 split proinsulin (P = 1.72 x 10(-4)) relative to total insulin levels; i.e., differences between T/T and C/C homozygotes amounted to 21.9 and 18.4% respectively. Notably, the insulin-to-glucose ratio (IGR) at 30-min oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a frequently used surrogate of first-phase insulin secretion, was not associated with the TCF7L2 SNP (P > 0.7). However, the insulin response (IGR) at 60-min OGTT was significantly lower in T-allele carriers (P = 3.5 x 10(-3)). The T-allele was also associated with higher A1C concentrations (P = 1.2 x 10(-2)) and reduced beta-cell function, assessed by homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (P = 2.8 x 10(-2)). Similar results were obtained for the other TCF7L2 SNPs. Of note, both major genes involved in proinsulin processing (PC1, PC2) contain TCF-binding sites in their promoters. Our findings suggest that the TCF7L2 risk allele may predispose to type 2 diabetes by impairing beta-cell proinsulin processing. The risk allele increases proinsulin levels and diminishes the 60-min but not 30-min insulin response during OGTT. The strong association between the TCF7L2 risk allele and fasting proinsulin but not insulin levels is notable, as, in this unselected and largely normoglycemic population, external influences on beta-cell stress are unlikely to be major factors influencing the efficiency of proinsulin processing.

17429603|t|TCF7L2 in the Go-DARTS study: evidence for a gene dose effect on both diabetes susceptibility and control of glucose levels.
17429603|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been identified as a type 2 diabetes locus from genome-wide linkage studies and subsequent association analysis. We investigated the role of two common variants in TCF7L2 in a large case-control study recruited from the Tayside region of Scotland, UK. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 6,516 participants for rs12255372 and rs7903146 and analysed the role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility using binary logistic regression. Age, sex and obesity status were examined as covariates. The distribution of the genotypes within different treatment groups of cases was examined. RESULTS: Both variants were associated with type 2 diabetes (p < 10(-13)). The variants were present at very similar frequencies and were in strong linkage disequilibrium (R(2) = 0.88, D' = 0.89). A gene dosage effect of the rare allele of both variants was observed, the heterozygote CT group of rs7903146 having an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 1.2-1.5, p=1.54 x 10(-7)) for type 2 diabetes and the TT homozygote having a greater risk (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.7-2.5, p=1.40 x 10(-12)). An interaction with sex was observed, the males displaying a higher degree of genotype-associated risk compared with the females (p = 0.023). The T allele was associated with increased HbA(1c) levels in both cases and controls, and with decreased BMI and waist circumference in case but not controls. The T allele was overrepresented in individuals requiring insulin treatment and underrepresented in the patients being managed by diet alone (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed TCF7L2 to be a diabetes locus in a large case-control study in Tayside, UK. Our data suggest that variants of TCF7L2 may be associated with increased disease severity and therapeutic failure.

17437080|t|Variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene predict conversion to type 2 diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and are associated with impaired glucose regulation and impaired insulin secretion.
17437080|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated the association of variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene with: (1) incident diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS, Study I); (2) type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation (i.e. IGT or IFG) in a cross-sectional study (Study II); and (3) insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue expression of TCF7L2 in offspring of type 2 diabetic probands (III). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study I (the DPS) included 507 individuals with IGT who were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups and followed for an average of 3.9 years to monitor for progression to diabetes. Study II was a population-based cross-sectional study of 1,766 men, aged 50-70 years, randomly selected from the population of Kuopio, eastern Finland. Study III included 238 non-diabetic offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes. Genotyping of rs12255372 and rs7903146 of TCF7L2 was carried out. RESULTS: In the DPS, the TT genotype of rs12255372 was significantly associated with an adjusted 2.85-fold risk (95% CI 1.17-6.95, p = 0.021) of incident diabetes in the control group, but not in the intervention group. In Study II, the adjusted odds ratio in subjects with the TT genotype was 3.40 (1.45-7.97, p = 0.005) for the comparison of diabetic subjects with normoglycaemic subjects. The T allele of rs12255372 was significantly associated with decreased insulin secretion (Studies II, III). Expression of TCF7L2 in adipose tissue tended to be lower in subjects with the TT risk genotypes of rs12255372 and rs7903146. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The variant of rs12255372 of TCF7L2 was associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the DPS and in a separate population-based cross-sectional study. Impaired insulin secretion is likely to be the main cause for our findings.

17460697|t|A variant in CDKAL1 influences insulin response and risk of type 2 diabetes.
17460697|a|We conducted a genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Icelandic cases and controls, and we found that a previously described variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) gene conferred the most significant risk. In addition to confirming two recently identified risk variants, we identified a variant in the CDKAL1 gene that was associated with T2D in individuals of European ancestry (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.27), P = 7.7 x 10(-9)) and individuals from Hong Kong of Han Chinese ancestry (OR = 1.25 (1.11-1.40), P = 0.00018). The genotype OR of this variant suggested that the effect was substantially stronger in homozygous carriers than in heterozygous carriers. The ORs for homozygotes were 1.50 (1.31-1.72) and 1.55 (1.23-1.95) in the European and Hong Kong groups, respectively. The insulin response for homozygotes was approximately 20% lower than for heterozygotes or noncarriers, suggesting that this variant confers risk of T2D through reduced insulin secretion.

17463248|t|A genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in Finns detects multiple susceptibility variants.
17463248|a|Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.

17466512|t|Genetics of type 2 diabetes.
17466512|a|Identification and characterization of genetic variants that either cause or predispose to diabetes are a major focus of biomedical research. As of early 2007, the molecular basis of most forms of monogenic diabetes resulting from beta-cell dysfunction is known and, in particular, there has been recent success in delineating the genetic aetiology of neonatal diabetes. Finding genes predisposing to more common, multifactorial forms of type 2 diabetes represents a far greater challenge, and only a handful of robust, well-replicated examples have been established. Nevertheless, 2006 heralded identification of the most important type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene known so far, TCF7L2, and in 2007 large-scale genome-wide association studies are destined to provide novel insights into the genetic architecture and biology of type 2 diabetes.

17470138|t|Association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes in Mexico City.
17470138|a|Polymorphisms within the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in several recent studies. We characterized three of these polymorphisms (rs12255372, rs7903146 and the microsatellite DG10S478) in an admixed sample of 286 patients with T2D and 275 controls from Mexico City. We also analyzed three samples representative of the relevant parental populations: Native Americans from the state of Guerrero (Mexico), Spanish from Valencia and Nigerians (Bini from the Edo region). In order to minimize potential confounding because of the presence of population stratification in the sample, we evaluated the association of the three TCF7L2 polymorphisms with T2D by using the program admixmap to fit a logistic regression model incorporating individual ancestry, sex, age, body mass index and education. The markers rs12255372, rs7903146 and DG10S478 are in tight disequilibrium in the Mexican sample. We observed a significant association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 and the microsatellite DG10S478 with T2D in the Mexican sample [rs12255372, odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, p = 0.017; DG10S478, OR = 1.62, p = 0.041]. The SNP rs7903146 shows similar trends, but its association with T2D is not as strong (OR = 1.39, p = 0.152). Analysis of the parental samples, as well as other available data, indicates that there are substantial population frequency differences for these polymorphisms: The frequencies of the T2D risk factors are more than 20% higher in European and West African populations than in East Asian and Native American populations.

17476472|t|TCF7L2 is reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes in various ethnic groups: a global meta-analysis.
17476472|a|TCF7L2 variants have been consistently associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in populations of different ethnic descent. Among them, the rs7903146 T allele is probably the best proxy to evaluate the effect of this gene on T2D risk in additional ethnic groups. In the present study, we investigated the association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and T2D in Moroccans (406 normoglycemic individuals and 504 T2D subjects) and in white Austrians (1,075 normoglycemic individuals and 486 T2D subjects). Then, we systematically reviewed the association of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with T2D risk in a meta-analysis, combining our data with data from previous studies. The allelic odds ratios (ORs) for T2D were 1.56 [1.29-1.89] (p = 2.9 x 10(-6)) and 1.52 [1.29-1.78] (p = 3.0 x 10(-7)) in Moroccans and Austrians, respectively. No heterogeneity was found between these two different populations by Woolf test (chi (2) = 0.04, df = 1, p = 0.84). We found 28 original published association studies dealing with the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism in T2D. A meta-analysis was then performed on 29,195 control subjects and 17,202 cases. No heterogeneity in genotypic distribution was found (Woolf test: chi (2) = 31.5, df = 26, p = 0.21; Higgins statistic: I2 = 14.1%). A Mantel-Haenszel procedure was then performed to provide a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.46 [1.42-1.51] (p = 5.4 x 10(-140)). No publication bias was detected, using the conservative Egger's regression asymmetry test (t = -1.6, df = 25, p = 0.11). Compared to any other gene variants previously confirmed by meta-analysis, TCF7L2 can be distinguished by its tremendous reproducibility of association with T2D and its OR twice as high. In the near future, large-scale genome-wide association studies will fully extend the genome coverage, potentially delivering other common diabetes-susceptibility genes like TCF7L2.

17503332|t|Type 2 diabetes TCF7L2 risk genotypes alter birth weight: a study of 24,053 individuals.
17503332|a|The role of genes in normal birth-weight variation is poorly understood, and it has been suggested that the genetic component of fetal growth is small. Type 2 diabetes genes may influence birth weight through maternal genotype, by increasing maternal glycemia in pregnancy, or through fetal genotype, by altering fetal insulin secretion. We aimed to assess the role of the recently described type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2 in birth weight. We genotyped the polymorphism rs7903146 in 15,709 individuals whose birth weight was available from six studies and in 8,344 mothers from three studies. Each fetal copy of the predisposing allele was associated with an 18-g (95% confidence interval [CI] 7-29 g) increase in birth weight (P=.001) and each maternal copy with a 30-g (95% CI 15-45 g) increase in offspring birth weight (P=2.8x10-5). Stratification by fetal genotype suggested that the association was driven by maternal genotype (31-g [95% CI 9-48 g] increase per allele; corrected P=.003). Analysis of diabetes-related traits in 10,314 nondiabetic individuals suggested the most likely mechanism is that the risk allele reduces maternal insulin secretion (disposition index reduced by ~0.15 standard deviation; P=1x10-4), which results in increased maternal glycemia in pregnancy and hence increased offspring birth weight. We combined information with the other common variant known to alter fetal growth, the -30G-->A polymorphism of glucokinase (rs1799884). The 4% of offspring born to mothers carrying three or four risk alleles were 119 g (95% CI 62-172 g) heavier than were the 32% born to mothers with none (for overall trend, P=2x10-7), comparable to the impact of maternal smoking during pregnancy. In conclusion, we have identified the first type 2 diabetes-susceptibility allele to be reproducibly associated with birth weight. Common gene variants can substantially influence normal birth-weight variation.

17519421|a|OBJECTIVE: There is considerable interindividual variation in sulfonylurea response in type 2 diabetes. Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants have been identified to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes risk, probably due to decreased beta-cell function. We hypothesized that variation in TCF7L2 would influence response to sulfonylureas but not metformin. We studied the effect of TCF7L2 rs12255372 and rs7903146 genotypes on glycemic response. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The DARTS/MEMO (Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside/Medicines Monitoring Unit) collaboration database includes prescribing, biochemistry, and clinical phenotype of all patients with diabetes within Tayside, Scotland, from 1992. Of these, the TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 4,469 patients with type 2 diabetes recruited to GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside) between 1997 and July 2006. A total of 901 incident sulfonylurea users and 945 metformin users were identified. A logistic regression was used with treatment failure defined as an A1C >7% within 3-12 months after treatment initiation. Covariates included the TCF7L2 genotype, BMI, sex, age diagnosed, drug adherence, and drug dose. A1C pretreatment was available in a subset of patients (sulfonylurea n = 579; metformin n = 755). RESULTS: Carriers of the risk allele were less likely to respond to sulfonylureas with an odds ratio (OR) for failure of 1.95 (95% CI 1.23-3.06; P = 0.005), comparing rs12255372 T/T vs. G/G. Including the baseline A1C strengthened this association (OR 2.16 [95% CI 1.21-3.86], P = 0.009). A similar, although slightly weaker, association was seen with rs7903146. No association was seen between metformin response and either single nucleotide polymorphism, after adjustment for baseline A1C. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 variants influence therapeutic response to sulfonylureas but not metformin. This study establishes that genetic variation can alter response to therapy in type 2 diabetes.

17561964|t|A new era in finding Type 2 diabetes genes-the unusual suspects.
17561964|a|In 1988 the task of identifying Type 2 diabetes genes was described as a nightmare. For the next 17 years this proved to be largely correct. In the meantime the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes rose sharply due to non-genetic factors, compounding the problem of trying to find genes. Despite a huge amount of effort, progress was disappointing and only two genes, PPARG and KCNJ11, were confirmed beyond doubt as Type 2 diabetes risk factors in multiple studies. The reasons for this have been well documented and mainly consist of the use of inappropriate levels of statistical inference given the many hundreds of thousands of potential risk polymorphisms in the genome and their small effect sizes. The good news is that these problems are now surmountable and prospects for finding many more genes are bright. This year saw the identification of a third gene, TCF7L2, that has a greater impact on risk than the first two and provided important lessons for Type 2 diabetes genetic studies. The most important of these lessons was that previously unsuspected genes may be involved. In this review I discuss why this year is the start of a new era in our understanding of Type 2 diabetes genes and how this may lead to improved patient care.

17563454|t|The new type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2.
17563454|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Common variants in the gene that encodes the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. This highly reproducible association may uncover novel mechanisms of glycemic pathophysiology. RECENT FINDINGS: The initial publication of an association of common variants in TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes in people of European descent has been followed by an avalanche of replication reports. These papers not only confirm the original finding, but also extend it to other populations, fine map the source of the association signal, describe its effect on metabolic parameters in humans, open the door to a more precise molecular characterization, and provide an insight into its possible impact on diabetes therapy. SUMMARY: The discovery of TCF7L2 as a diabetes gene illustrates that novel true diabetes genes can be found, their association with type 2 diabetes replicated and their effect incorporated into risk prediction models. It is hoped that the detection of other such genes in genome-wide association scans will help elucidate the genetic architecture of this disease.

17563458|t|Evaluation of polymorphisms known to contribute to risk for diabetes in African and African-American populations.
17563458|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Populations of direct African ancestry have much greater genetic diversity than do other populations. African-American populations exhibit twice the prevalence of type 2 diabetes as compared with their Caucasian counterparts. African-American populations are likely to have unique genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. This review addresses current knowledge of susceptibility genes that are shared with other groups and those that are unique to populations of African descent. RECENT FINDINGS: When compared with the plethora of Caucasian studies, relatively few studies have been conducted in African or African-American populations. The most exciting findings have been family-based linkage studies, which point to multiple regions that may harbor susceptibility genes. Recent work suggests that the major Caucasian locus, TCF7L2, plays a role in some African-based populations, whereas unique factors remain to be confirmed. SUMMARY: Although progress has been made in finding the genetic cause of type 2 diabetes in African and African-American populations, at this time no variant can be considered unequivocally confirmed as a diabetes susceptibility locus.

17563459|t|Gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and metabolism.
17563459|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gene-environment interaction can be viewed as a departure from an otherwise expected additivity of genetic and environmental factors on a given outcome measure. Important genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and intermediary traits, probably modulated by their complex interaction. This paper provides an update on the current literature investigating gene-environment interactions of type 2 diabetes and metabolic phenotypes, and discusses the future perspectives of this research. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in gene-environment interaction studies of metabolism have involved LIPC, APOA5 and PPARG variation, and nutrition and physical activity, of which the most consistently replicated observations have been obtained for APOA5. Also, intervention studies of the promising TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes gene and possible future strategies are discussed. SUMMARY: Possibly as a result of the complexity of these multifactorial diseases, recent years have seen only limited success in unravelling significant gene-environment interactions, but important insights have been gained and they hold promise for implementation in lifestyle intervention strategies. We need to evolve to more complex, but realistic, scenarios involving several genes and environmental factors. Recent progress in statistical methods allowing for higher-order interactions may make this possible.

17579206|t|Association study of the genetic polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population.
17579206|a|OBJECTIVE: Genetic polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is one of the few validated genetic variants with large effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes in the populations of European ancestry. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of the TCF7L2 polymorphisms in a Han Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the TCF7L2 gene in 1,520 unrelated subjects from a Han Chinese population in Taiwan. The associations of SNPs and haplotypes with type 2 diabetes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the TCF7L2 gene were analyzed. RESULTS: The previously reported SNPs rs7903146 T- and rs12255372 T-alleles of the TCF7L2 gene were rare and were not associated with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population, which may attribute to the low frequencies of these two SNPs. SNP rs290487 located in an LD block close to the 3' end of the gene was associated with type 2 diabetes (allele-specific P = 0.0021; permuted P = 0.03). The odds ratio was 1.36 for the CT genotype (95% CI 1.08-1.71; P = 0.0063) and 1.51 for the CC genotype (1.10 -2.07; P = 0.0085) compared with the TT genotype, corresponding to a population attributable risk fraction of 18.7%. The haplotypes composed of rs290487 were also significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (global P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel risk-conferring genetic variant of TCF7L2 for type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. Our data suggested that the TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms are major determinants for risk of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population.

17579832|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis traits and gene expression in US participants of European and African descent.
17579832|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to determine: (1) the role of previously described transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants in type 2 diabetes in African American individuals and in participants of European ancestry; (2) the physiological impact of these variants on glucose homeostasis; and (3) whether the non-coding variants altered TCF7L2 expression in adipocytes and transformed lymphocytes. METHODS: Association studies were conducted by genotyping 932 Europid and African American diabetic and control participants. Family studies were conducted in 673 members of 68 Europid families ascertained for at least two diabetic siblings. Metabolic studies were conducted in 585 non-diabetic individuals who had undergone frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests to determine insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Gene expression studies were conducted in 74 adipose samples and 64 muscle samples from non-diabetic individuals with known genotypes and also in 55 lymphoblastoid cell lines. RESULTS: TCF7L2 variants were associated with type 2 diabetes in a Europid case-control population and in families, but not in African Americans. Risk alleles increased the 60 min post-challenge glucose value in Europid families and reduced insulin sensitivity by 45% in Europids, but did not alter insulin secretion. TCF7L2 expression was not altered by genotype and did not correlate with insulin sensitivity or BMI. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed TCF7L2 as a risk factor in a population of European descent, where it reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, but not insulin secretion. We found no role in African Americans and could not explain the association by altered adipocyte or muscle gene expression.

17593304|t|TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant does not associate with smallness for gestational age in the French population.
17593304|a|BACKGROUND: In adults, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele, commonly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), has been also associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) in T2D individuals and with a smaller waist circumference in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: The present association study aimed at analyzing the contribution of the rs7903146 SNP to smallness for gestational age (SGA) and metabolic profiles in subjects with SGA or appropriate for gestational age birth weight (AGA). Two groups of French Caucasian subjects were selected on birth data: SGA (birth weight < 10th percentile; n = 764), and AGA (25th < birth weight < 75th percentile; n = 627). Family-based association tests were also performed in 3,012 subjects from 628 SGA and AGA pedigrees. RESULTS: The rs7903146 genotypic distributions between AGA (30.7%) and SGA (29.0%) were not statistically different (allelic OR = 0.92 [0.78-1.09], p = 0.34). Family association-based studies did not show a distortion of T allele transmission in SGA subjects (p = 0.52). No significant effect of the T allele was detected on any of the metabolic parameters in the SGA group. However, in the AGA group, trends towards a lower insulin secretion (p = 0.03) and a higher fasting glycaemia (p = 0.002) were detected in carriers of the T allele. CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant neither increases the risk for SGA nor modulates birth weight and young adulthood glucose homeostasis in French Caucasian subjects born with SGA.

17601994|t|Variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with type 2 diabetes in an African-American population enriched for nephropathy.
17601994|a|OBJECTIVE: Recently, variants in the TCF7L2 gene have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes across multiple Europid populations, but only one small sample of African-American type 2 diabetic patients has been examined. Our objective was to investigate the importance of TCF7L2 in a larger African-American case-control population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six known type 2 diabetes genes in 577 African-American case subjects with type 2 diabetes enriched for nephropathy and 596 African-American control subjects. Additionally, we genotyped 70 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to apply adjustments for differences in ancestral proportions. RESULTS: The most significant associations were observed with TCF7L2 intron 3 SNPs rs7903146 (additive P = 4.10 x 10(-6), odds ratio [OR] 1.51; admixture-adjusted P(a) = 3.77 x 10(-6)) and rs7901695 (P = 0.001, OR 1.30; P(a) = 0.003). The 2-SNP haplotype containing these SNPs was also associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 3 x 10(-5)). Modest associations were also seen with TCF7L2 intron 4 SNPs rs7895340, rs11196205, and rs12255372 (0.01 < P < 0.05; 0.03 < P(a) < 0.08), as well as with ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) SNPs (0.01 < P < 0.05; 0.01 < P(a) < 0.41). No significant associations were detected with genotyped calpain 10 (CAPN10), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), and transcription factor 1 (TCF1) SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that variants in the TCF7L2 gene significantly contribute to diabetes susceptibility in African-American populations.

17609304|t|Replication and identification of novel variants at TCF7L2 associated with type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese.
17609304|a|OBJECTIVE: Variations at a large linkage disequilibrium (LD) block of transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) were reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Icelandic, Danish and European-American populations and further replicated in other populations of European, African, and Asian ancestries. However, data for Chinese and comprehensive survey of the whole gene are lacking. DESIGN: We attempted to examine 22 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning across the TCF7L2 gene for association with T2D in Hong Kong Chinese. We first studied a case-control sample involving 433 hospital cases with familial early-onset T2D and 419 normal controls and further studied the associated SNPs in 450 members of 142 diabetic families. RESULTS: Two of the previously reported risk alleles at rs11196205 (C) and rs7903146 (T) were rare in Chinese (0.013 and 0.024, respectively, in controls). Rs11196205 was associated with T2D [odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 2.11 (1.04-4.26)], whereas the association for rs7903146 [OR (95% CI) = 1.27 (0.71-2.29)] was not significant in the case-control sample. Interestingly, another SNP (rs11196218 G allele) located in adjacent LD block conferred independent risk for T2D [OR (95%CI) =1.43 (1.14-1.79)] and contributed high-population attributable risk of 42%. The association finding of rs11196218 and its haplotype for T2D was also replicated in the family sample (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with others' findings that variations at TCF7L2 contribute to T2D, including Chinese. The presence of association signals spanning several LD blocks warrants further examination of extended regions to reveal the causal variant(s) for this important T2D gene.

17618413|t|Variants of the TCF7L2 gene are associated with beta cell dysfunction and confer an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the ULSAM cohort of Swedish elderly men.
17618413|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In a population-based cohort of elderly men with well-defined phenotypes and biochemical markers related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we analysed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7903146 and rs12255372, in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1,142 subjects were from the population-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort study (see http://www.pubcare.uu.se/ULSAM/, last accessed in May 2007). Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp; fasting intact and 32-33 split proinsulin, immunoreactive insulin and specific insulin were measured in plasma samples. The SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 were genotyped using a fluorescent homogeneous single base extension assay. The SNP genotypes were analysed against diabetes prevalence at age 70 using logistic regression and against quantitative biochemical measures using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: We replicated the association with type 2 diabetes mellitus for both SNPs in this cohort of elderly males. The highest significant odds ratio (2.15, 95% CI 1.20-3.85) was found for SNP rs7903146. The odds ratio for SNP rs12255372 was 1.69 (95% CI 1.20-2.39). Both TCF7L2 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with plasma proinsulin when adjusting for insulin sensitivity, both in the whole cohort and when the diabetic subjects were excluded. Analysis for fasting plasma insulin or insulin sensitivity did not give significant results. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The association between the risk alleles of the two SNPs studied and levels of proinsulin in plasma, identified when adjusting for insulin sensitivity using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp measurements in this study, is an important novel finding.

17653210|t|Genetic variations associated with diabetic nephropathy and type II diabetes in a Japanese population.
17653210|a|Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and type II diabetes. To identify the genetic polymorphisms associated with diabetic nephropathy and type II diabetes, we performed a genome-wide association study using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as genetic markers. We also analyzed polymorphisms within the genes encoding for the renin-angiotensin system that were considered as candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy susceptibility and the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) as a candidate for type II diabetes, in a large cohort of a Japanese population. A genome-wide association study identified SLC12A3 and engulfment and cell motility 1 gene as the new candidates for diabetic nephropathy and transcription factor-activating protein 2beta as a novel susceptibility gene for type II diabetes; this observation was based on the significant association between the polymorphisms within the genes and the corresponding diseases (P<0.0001). Further, we discovered that the genes encoding the angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin II type I receptor have a significant combinational effect on conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, TCF7L2 that has been reported as a convincing susceptibility gene for type II diabetes in Caucasian populations was also shown to be associated with type II diabetes in a Japanese population. These genes could be considered as strong susceptibility genes for diabetic nephropathy and type II diabetes in the Japanese, although the new candidates that have been identified by genome-wide screening need to be examined in greater detail by several replication studies.

17661009|t|Impaired glucagon-like peptide-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms.
17661009|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with type 2 diabetes and reduced insulin secretion. The transcription factor TCF7L2 is an essential factor for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from intestinal L cells. We studied whether a defect in the enteroinsular axis contributes to impaired insulin secretion in carriers of TCF7L2 polymorphisms. METHODS: We genotyped 1,110 non-diabetic German participants for five single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2. All participants underwent an OGTT; GLP-1 secretion was measured in 155 participants. In 210 participants, an IVGTT combined with a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp was performed. In another 160 participants from the Netherlands and 73 from Germany, a hyperglycaemic clamp (10 mmol/l) was performed. In 73 German participants this clamp was combined with a GLP-1 infusion and an arginine bolus. RESULTS: The OGTT data confirmed that variants in TCF7L2 are associated with reduced insulin secretion. In contrast, insulin secretion induced by an i.v. glucose challenge in the IVGTT and hyperglycaemic clamp was not different between the genotypes. GLP-1 concentrations during the OGTT were not influenced by the TCF7L2 variants. However, GLP-1-infusion combined with a hyperglycaemic clamp showed a significant reduction in GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in carriers of the risk allele in two variants (rs7903146, rs12255372, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Variants of TCF7L2 specifically impair GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. This seems to be rather the result of a functional defect in the GLP-1 signalling in beta cells than a reduction in GLP-1 secretion. This defect might explain the impaired insulin secretion in carriers of the risk alleles and confers the increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

17665514|t|Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene and predisposition to type 2 diabetes in UK European Whites, Indian Asians and Afro-Caribbean men and women.
17665514|a|Common variants of TCF7L2, encoding a beta-cell-expressed transcription factor, are strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined this association using both prospective and case-control designs. A total of 2,676 healthy European white middle-aged men from the prospective NPHSII (158 developed T2D over 15 years surveillance) were genotyped for two intronic SNPs [rs 7903146 (IVS3C>T) and rs12255372 (IVS4G>T)] which showed strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.88, p<0.001; R(2)=0.76, p<0.001). The IVS5T allele frequency was 0.28 (95% CI 0.27-0.29) and 0.33 (0.28-0.39) in healthy and T2D, respectively (p=0.04). Compared to CC men, CT and TT men had an adjusted [for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and C-reactive protein levels] hazard ratio for T2D of 1.65 (1.13-2.41) and 1.87 (0.99-3.53), respectively, p<0.01. The population attributable fraction for diabetes risk was 17%. In 1459, European white T2D men and women (60% male), T allele frequency was 0.36 (0.34-0.38), and compared to NPHSII healthy men the OR for T2D for the CT and TT subjects was 1.43 (1.24-1.65) and 2.11 (1.69-2.63), respectively p=<0.0001. A similar effect was observed in 919 T2D Indian Asians [OR=1.50 (1.14-1.99) and 1.64 (1.03-2.63) p=0.003] and 385 Afro-Caribbean subjects [OR=1.25 (0.90-1.75) and 1.32 (0.74-2.33) p=0.17] compared to non-diabetic ethnically matched subjects from South London. Weaker associations were found for the IVS4G>T in all studies. Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was high in Indian Asians (D'=0.94), but much weaker in Afro-Caribbeans (D'=0.17) and haplotype frequencies differed markedly in this group. These results extend previous observations to other ethnic groups, and strongly confirm that TCF7L2 genotype is a major risk factor for development of T2D.

17668382|t|Type 2 diabetes whole-genome association study in four populations: the DiaGen consortium.
17668382|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common, polygenic chronic disease with high heritability. The purpose of this whole-genome association study was to discover novel T2D-associated genes. We genotyped 500 familial cases and 497 controls with >300,000 HapMap-derived tagging single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) markers. When a stringent statistical correction for multiple testing was used, the only significant SNP was at TCF7L2, which has already been discovered and confirmed as a T2D-susceptibility gene. For a replication study, we selected 10 SNPs in six chromosomal regions with the strongest association (singly or as part of a haplotype) for retesting in an independent case-control set including 2,573 T2D cases and 2,776 controls. The most significant replicated result was found at the AHI1-LOC441171 gene region.

17671643|t|Prime suspect: the TCF7L2 gene and type 2 diabetes risk.
17671643|a|Transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the most important type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene identified to date, with common intronic variants strongly associated with diabetes in all major racial groups. This ubiquitous transcription factor in the Wnt signaling pathway was not previously known to be involved in glucose homeostasis, so defining the underlying mechanism(s) will provide new insights into diabetes. In this issue of the JCI, Lyssenko and colleagues report on their human and isolated islet studies and suggest that the risk allele increases TCF7L2 expression in the pancreatic beta cell, reducing insulin secretion and hence predisposing the individual to diabetes (see the related article beginning on page 2155).

17671651|t|Mechanisms by which common variants in the TCF7L2 gene increase risk of type 2 diabetes.
17671651|a|Genetic variants in the gene encoding for transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and impaired beta cell function, but the mechanisms have remained unknown. We therefore studied prospectively the ability of common variants in TCF7L2 to predict future T2D and explored the mechanisms by which they would do this. Scandinavian subjects followed for up to 22 years were genotyped for 3 SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs10885406) in TCF7L2, and a subset of them underwent extensive metabolic studies. Expression of TCF7L2 was related to genotype and metabolic parameters in human islets. The CT/TT genotypes of SNP rs7903146 strongly predicted future T2D in 2 independent cohorts (Swedish and Finnish). The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in T2D, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype. Overexpression of TCF7L2 in human islets reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In conclusion, the increased risk of T2D conferred by variants in TCF7L2 involves the enteroinsular axis, enhanced expression of the gene in islets, and impaired insulin secretion.

17683561|t|The TCF7L2 locus and type 1 diabetes.
17683561|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 belongs to a subfamily of TCF7-like HMG box-containing transcription factors, and maps to human chromosome 10q25.3. A recent study identified genetic association of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with this gene, correlated with diminished insulin secretion. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of genetic association between TCF7L2 and type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: The SNP most significantly associated with T2D, rs7903146, was genotyped in 886 T1D nuclear family trios with ethnic backgrounds of mixed European descent. RESULTS: This study found no T1D association with, and no age-of-onset effect from rs7903146. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a T2D mechanism mediated by TCF7L2 does not participate in the etiology of T1D.

17697858|t|The rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians.
17697858|a|One thousand thirty-eight normal glucose-tolerant and 1031 type 2 diabetic subjects selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay to investigate the association of rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians. The frequency of the "T" allele of both rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms was significantly higher in diabetic subjects (23% and 33%) compared to that in normal glucose-tolerant subjects (19% and 28%; P = .001 and P = .0001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis of the rs12255372(G/T) polymorphism showed that the odds ratio (adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index) was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.37; P = .034) for the TT genotype and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.06-1.58; P = .011) for the TG genotype when compared with the GG genotype. Adjusted odds ratios for the TT and TC genotypes of the rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism were found to be 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08; P = .013) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.18-1.76; P = .0003), respectively, compared with the CC genotype. Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs12255372(G/T) had significantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.1 +/- 1.4 mmol/L) than those with the GG genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .011). Normal glucose-tolerant subjects with the TT genotype of rs7903146(C/T) polymorphism had significantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels (mean +/- SD, 6.0 +/- 1.3 mmol/L) than those with the CC genotype (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P = .004). In conclusion, the T allele of the rs12255372(G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) polymorphisms of TCF7L2 gene confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indians.

17725629|t|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with Type 2 diabetes in UK community-based cases, but the risk allele frequency is reduced compared with UK cases selected for genetic studies.
17725629|a|AIMS: Common polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes. Many studies include a large proportion of cases enriched for family history or young age of diagnosis and may therefore provide an overestimation of the general population risk. We aimed to compare the impact of TCF7L2 in UK community-based Type 2 diabetic subjects with that in subjects ascertained for genetic studies. METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 in 1068 cases from two sources: 487 from 10 GP practices and 601 ascertained for genetic studies, and 2099 control subjects from two sources: 1099 parents from a birth cohort (population control subjects) and 300 subjects with normal fasting glucose aged > or = 45 years (community control subjects). RESULTS: When compared with Type 2 diabetes cases ascertained for genetic studies, the risk allele frequency in community-based cases was lower (40 vs. 36%, P = 0.04), but there was no difference in risk allele frequency between community-based control and population-based control subjects (31 vs. 30%, P = 0.61). The T allele of rs7903146 increased Type 2 diabetes risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.13-1.52; P = 0.0002) in community-based cases, but this OR was lower than the OR of cases enriched for genetic studies [1.58 (95% CI: 1.38-1.80), P = 1.4 x 10(-11)] and the combined OR of meta-analysis of 10 studies to date on rs7903146 [1.48 (95% CI: 1.41-1.54), P < 10(-20)]. CONCLUSION: Common variation in the TCF7L2 gene contributes to Type 2 diabetes risk in UK patients recruited in general practice, but the risk allele frequency may be lower than that in subjects enriched for genetic effects.

17805508|t|Disparate genetic influences on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes revealed by a lack of association between common variants within the TCF7L2 gene and PCOS.
17805508|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Common variants of the gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have a powerful effect on individual risk of type 2 diabetes (per allele odds ratio approximately 1.35). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes are familial conditions sharing common features. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to establish whether variation in TCF7L2 also influences the development of PCOS. METHODS: We conducted a genetic association study of variants of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372) using both case-control and quantitative trait approaches. Case-control analyses were conducted in (1) 369 PCOS cases and 2574 controls of UK British/Irish origin, and (2) 540 women with PCOS symptoms and 1083 controls from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966. Quantitative trait analyses (androgen levels) were also performed (1249 individuals). RESULTS: There was no association between rs7903146 and PCOS in the UK case-control study (Cochran-Armitage test, p = 0.51); nor with symptomatic status in the Finnish cohort (p = 0.36). In addition, there were no relationships between the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 and androgen levels (UK cases, p = 0.99; Finnish controls, p = 0.57; Finnish symptomatic cases, p = 0.80). Results at rs12255372 were similar, reflecting strong linkage disequilibrium with rs7903146. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study was powered to detect an effect on PCOS susceptibility similar to that previously reported for these variants on type 2 diabetes. Failure to detect any evident association with PCOS provides the strongest evidence yet that the genetic architecture of these related conditions is qualitatively distinct.

17888129|t|The importance of TCF7L2.
17888129|a|After many years of frustratingly limited success, the genetic architecture of Type 2 diabetes is finally being uncovered. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified novel genes predisposing to Type 2 diabetes, which are giving fascinating new insights into the pathophysiology of this complex disease. Of the genes so far identified by this approach, one stands out as having by far the biggest effect on disease risk. A common variant of TCF7L2, when present in two copies, is associated with an approximate 2-fold higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. This short review focuses on the TCF7L2 finding and discusses its significance for Type 2 diabetes genetic studies and for clinical practice.

30290420|t|Challenges in studies of the genetic basis of Type 2 diabetes.
30290420|a|The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide in epidemic proportions. This increase is mainly due to increased incidence and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 80-90% of all cases of diabetes. The susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes is determined by genetic and environmental factors. Major genes responsible for Type 2 diabetes have not yet been identified. The most replicated susceptibility gene for Type 2 diabetes is TCF7L2, recently published by investigators from Iceland. The second most widely replicated association between a genetic variation and the risk of Type 2 diabetes is that of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y2 gene. Furthermore, the common E23K polymorphism in the KCJN11 gene, encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium-channel subunit Kir6.2, and variants in the calpain-10 gene have been associated with increased susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes in meta-analyses. Several studies have investigated the possibility that rare, highly penetrant mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes lead to monogenic diabetes, while common polymorphisms increase the susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms in hepatic nuclear factor-4a are significantly associated with the risk of Type 2 diabetes. In this review, different approaches to identify susceptibility genes for Type 2 diabetes are discussed. In particular, the importance of prospective population-based cohort studies and prospective intervention studies are emphasized. Finally, genome-wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms randomly spaced across the entire genome may be useful in the identification of susceptibility genes for Type 2 diabetes.

17903298|t|Genome-wide association with diabetes-related traits in the Framingham Heart Study.
17903298|a|BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes may be conferred by genetic variants having modest effects on risk. Genome-wide fixed marker arrays offer a novel approach to detect these variants. METHODS: We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP array in 1,087 Framingham Offspring Study family members to examine genetic associations with three diabetes-related quantitative glucose traits (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c, 28-yr time-averaged FPG (tFPG)), three insulin traits (fasting insulin, HOMA-insulin resistance, and 0-120 min insulin sensitivity index); and with risk for diabetes. We used additive generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association test (FBAT) models to test associations of SNP genotypes with sex-age-age2-adjusted residual trait values, and Cox survival models to test incident diabetes. RESULTS: We found 415 SNPs associated (at p < 0.001) with at least one of the six quantitative traits in GEE, 242 in FBAT (18 overlapped with GEE for 639 non-overlapping SNPs), and 128 associated with incident diabetes (31 overlapped with the 639) giving 736 non-overlapping SNPs. Of these 736 SNPs, 439 were within 60 kb of a known gene. Additionally, 53 SNPs (of which 42 had r2 < 0.80 with each other) had p < 0.01 for incident diabetes AND (all 3 glucose traits OR all 3 insulin traits, OR 2 glucose traits and 2 insulin traits); of these, 36 overlapped with the 736 other SNPs. Of 100K SNPs, one (rs7100927) was in moderate LD (r2 = 0.50) with TCF7L2 (rs7903146), and was associated with risk of diabetes (Cox p-value 0.007, additive hazard ratio for diabetes = 1.56) and with tFPG (GEE p-value 0.03). There were no common (MAF > 1%) 100K SNPs in LD (r2 > 0.05) with ABCC8 A1369S (rs757110), KCNJ11 E23K (rs5219), or SNPs in CAPN10 or HNFa. PPARG P12A (rs1801282) was not significantly associated with diabetes or related traits. CONCLUSION: Framingham 100K SNP data is a resource for association tests of known and novel genes with diabetes and related traits posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite.

17909099|t|TCF7L2 is not a major susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians: analysis of 3,501 individuals.
17909099|a|OBJECTIVE: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was initially reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in Icelandic, Danish, and U.S. populations. We investigated whether TCF7L2 also has a role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility in Pima Indians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The six variants reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in the Icelandic study were genotyped in a population-based sample of 3,501 Pima Indians (1,561 subjects had type 2 diabetes, and 1,940 did not have diabetes). In addition, the coding and promoter regions of TCF7L2 were sequenced in 24 Pima subjects. The one variant identified by sequencing, 35 additional database variants positioned in introns, and the six variants reported in the Icelandic study were genotyped in Pima families to determine the haplotype structure of TCF7L2 among Pima Indians. Fourteen representative variants were selected and genotyped in 3,501 Pima Indians. RESULTS: The six variants initially reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes were less common in Pima Indians compared with samples of European origin, and none were associated with type 2 diabetes. One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07). However, several variants were associated with BMI; in particular, rs12255372 was associated in both general and within-family analyses (both P = 0.0007). Modest associations were also found with traits predictive for type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Variation within TCF7L2 does not confer major risk for type 2 diabetes among the Pima Indian population.

17934151|t|A variant of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and the risk of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus in renal allograft recipients.
17934151|a|OBJECTIVE: Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a major complication associated with kidney transplantation. Defects in insulin secretion play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PTDM. A polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene was reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes and possibly associated with an insulin secretion defect. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in TCF7L2 and PTDM in renal allograft recipients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 511 unrelated renal allograft recipients without previously known diabetes were enrolled. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs11196205, rs4506565, rs12243326, rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs7901695) were genotyped in the cohort, which consisted of 119 PTDM patients and 392 non-PTDM subjects. The genotyping of TCF7L2 polymorphisms was performed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: rs4506565, rs7901695, and rs7903146 were found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium. The rs7903146 genotype distribution was CC 94.3% and CT 5.7%. The incidence of PTDM was significantly higher in patients with the CT genotype than in patients with the CC genotype (41.4 vs. 22.2%) (odds ratio 2.474 [95% CI 1.146-5.341]; P = 0.024). The effect of this genotype remains significant after adjustment for age, sex, amount of body weight gain, and type of immunosuppressant (2.655 [1.168-6.038]; P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic variation is associated with an increased risk of PTDM in renal allograft recipients.

17971425|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with reduced acute insulin response in Hispanic Americans.
17971425|a|CONTEXT: Genetic variation at the transcription factor 7-like 2 locus has been linked to type 2 diabetes in predominantly European-derived populations. The biological basis of these associations remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate previously associated variants for association with measures of glucose homeostasis in Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans and determine the biological mechanism(s) through which these variants exert their effect. DESIGN: This study was the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Family Study (IRAS-FS). SETTING: The IRAS-FS is a community-based study of Hispanic-Americans (San Antonio, TX, and San Luis Valley, CO) and African-Americans (Los Angeles, CA). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1040 Hispanic-American and 500 African-American individuals from the IRAS-FS formed the basis of this study. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES(S): The primary glucose homeostasis phenotypes of interest in this study were derived from the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test and include insulin sensitivity, acute insulin response, and disposition index. RESULTS: In Hispanic-Americans, significant evidence of association was observed between single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs112255372 with reduced insulin secretion as measured by acute insulin response and adjusted for the degree of insulin sensitivity (P = 0.032 and 0.036, respectively). Other quantitative measures, e.g. insulin sensitivity or disposition index, were not associated with the single nucleotide polymorphisms examined. In African-Americans there was no evidence of association observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transcription factor 7-like 2 variants could play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in the Hispanic-American population through a mechanism involving insulin secretion.

17972059|t|TCF7L2 is associated with high serum triacylglycerol and differentially expressed in adipose tissue in families with familial combined hyperlipidaemia.
17972059|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Common DNA variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes. Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL) is characterised by hypertriacylglycerolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, or both. Additionally, disturbances in glucose metabolism are commonly seen in FCHL. Therefore, we hypothesised that TCF7L2 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for this common dyslipidaemia. METHODS: We investigated the effect of the TCF7L2 variants, rs7903146 and rs12255372, on FCHL and its component traits triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in 759 individuals from 55 Mexican families. As a replication sample, 719 individuals from 60 Finnish FCHL families were analysed. We also used quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate the transcript levels of TCF7L2 in 47 subcutaneous fat biopsies from unrelated Mexican FCHL and normolipidaemic participants. RESULTS: Significant evidence for association was observed for high TG for the T alleles of rs7903146 and rs12255372 (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) in Mexican FCHL families. No evidence for association was observed for FCHL, TC, ApoB or glucose in Mexicans. When testing rs7903146 and rs12255372 for replication in Finnish FCHL families, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with TG (p = 0.01 and p = 0.007). Furthermore, we observed statistically significant decreases in the mRNA levels (p = 0.0002) of TCF7L2 in FCHL- and TG-affected individuals. TCF7L2 expression was not altered by the SNP genotypes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data show that rs7903146 and rs12255372 are significantly associated with high TG in FCHL families from two different populations. In addition, significantly decreased expression of TCF7L2 was observed in TG- and FCHL-affected individuals.

17977958|t|Impact of common type 2 diabetes risk polymorphisms in the DESIR prospective study.
17977958|a|OBJECTIVE: The emerging picture of type 2 diabetes genetics involves differently assembled gene variants, each modestly increasing risk with environmental exposure. However, the relevance of these genes for disease prediction has not been extensively tested. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 19 common polymorphisms of 14 known candidate genes for their contribution to prevalence and incidence of glucose intolerance in the DESIR (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome) prospective study of middle-aged Caucasian subjects, including 3,877 participants (16.8% with hyperglycemia and 7.9% with diabetes after the 9-year study). RESULTS: The GCK (Glucokinase) -30A allele was associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk at the end of the follow-up study (adjusted OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.07-1.69]) under an additive model, as supported in independent French diabetic case subjects (OR 1.22, P = 0.007), with increased fasting glycemia (0.85% per A allele, P = 6 x 10(-5)) and decreased homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (4%, P = 0.0009). IL6 (Interleukin- 6) -174 G/C interacts with age in disease risk and modulates fasting glycemia according to age (1.36% decrease over 56 years, P = 5 x 10(-5)). These polymorphisms together with KCNJ11 (Kir6.2)-E23K and TCF7L2-rs7903146 may predict diabetes incidence in the DESIR cohort. Each additional risk allele at GCK, TCF7L2, and IL6 increased risk by 1.34 (P = 2 x 10(-6)), with an OR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.59-3.86), in carriers of at least four at-risk alleles compared with those with none or one risk allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm several at-risk polymorphisms for type 2 diabetes in a general population and demonstrate that prospective studies are valuable designs to complement classical genetic approaches.

18059616|t|Non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetic subjects: distinct phenotypes requiring special diabetes treatment and (or) prevention?
18059616|a|A major reason for the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across the world is the so-called obesity epidemic, which occurs both in developed and developing countries. However, a large proportion of patients with T2DM in European and, in particular, Asian countries are non-obese. The non-obese T2DM phenotype is characterized by disproportionally reduced insulin secretion and less insulin resistance, as compared with obese patients with T2DM. Importantly, non-obese patients with T2DM have a similar increased risk of cardiovascular disease as obese T2DM patients. The risk of T2DM in non-obese patients is influenced by genetics as well as factors operating in utero indicated by low birth weight. Furthermore, this phenotype is slightly more prevalent among patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, characterized by positive anti-GAD antibodies. The recently identified TCF7L2 gene polymorphism resulting in low insulin secretion influences the risk of T2DM in both obese and non-obese subjects, but is relatively more prevalent among non-obese patients with T2DM. Furthermore, the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR gamma gene influencing insulin action increases the risk of T2DM in non-obese subjects. Despite a "normal" body mass index, non-obese patients with T2DM are generally characterized by a higher degree of both abdominal and total fat masses (adiposity). Prevention of T2DM with lifestyle intervention is at least as effective in non-obese as in obese prediabetic subjects, and recent data suggest that metformin treatment targeting insulin resistance and non-glycemic cardiovascular disease risk factors is as beneficial in non-obese as in obese patients with T2DM. Nevertheless, non-obese patients with T2DM may progress to insulin treatment more rapidly as compared with obese patients with T2DM.

18071026|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 regulates beta-cell survival and function in human pancreatic islets.
18071026|a|OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin secretion in response to increased metabolic demand. This defect in beta-cell compensation seems to result from the interplay between environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Genome-wide association studies reveal that common variants in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to establish whether TCF7L2 plays a role in beta-cell function and/or survival. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate the effects of TCFL7L2 depletion, isolated islets were exposed to TCF7L2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) versus scrambled siRNA, and beta-cell survival and function were examined. For TCF7L2 overexpression, islets were cultured in glucose concentrations of 5.5-33.3 mmol/l and the cytokine mix interleukin-1 beta/gamma-interferon with or without overexpression of TCF7L2. Subsequently, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), beta-cell apoptosis [by transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and Western blotting for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Caspase-3 cleavage], and beta-cell proliferation (by Ki67 immunostaining) were analyzed. RESULTS: Depleting TCF7L2 by siRNA resulted in a 5.1-fold increase in beta-cell apoptosis, 2.2-fold decrease in beta-cell proliferation (P < 0.001), and 2.6-fold decrease in GSIS (P < 0.01) in human islets. Similarly, loss of TCF7L2 resulted in impaired beta-cell function in mouse islets. In contrast, overexpression of TCF7L2 protected islets from glucose and cytokine-induced apoptosis and impaired function. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 is required for maintaining GSIS and beta-cell survival. Changes in the level of active TCF7L2 in beta-cells from carriers of at-risk allele may be the reason for defective insulin secretion and progression of type 2 diabetes.

18072015|t|The DG10S478 variant in the TCF7L2 gene is not associated with microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes.
18072015|a|OBJECTIVE: The DG10S478 variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is a tetranucleotide repeat with six alleles. Alleles 0, 8 and 12 were found to account for 98% of chromosomes in population based controls. The composite allele X (non zero) has been associated with type 2 diabetes while allele 0 (no insertion) was described as protective. However, no data exist about the influence of DG10S478 variants on manifestation of diabetes and development of diabetic complications. METHODS: 250 patients with type 2 diabetes were tested for the DG10S478 allele X and its association with diabetic complications, age at diagnosis of diabetes and BMI. RESULTS: Allele 0 was found in 42.4% of the examined patients, 45.2% of the participants were found to be heterozygous and 12.4% homozygous for the composite allele X. The correlation of allele X with the age at diagnosis of diabetes was not significant. There was also no association of allele X with retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Only the correlation with BMI was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The DG10S478 variant seems to have no influence on manifestation of diabetes and the development of microvascular complications.

18097733|t|Association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in 4,087 Japanese subjects.
18097733|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple ethnic groups. Regarding the Asian population, Horikoshi et al. (Diabetologia 50:747-751, 2007) and Hayashi et al. (Diabetologia 50:980-984, 2007) reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 were associated with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population, while contradictory results were reported for Han Chinese populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes using a relatively large sample size: 2,214 Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1,873 normal controls. The minor alleles of rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372 showed significant associations with type 2 diabetes (OR=1.48, P=2.7 x 10(-4); OR=1.39, P=4.6 x 10(-4); OR=1.70, P=9.8 x 10(-5), respectively) in the combined sample sets. However, neither rs11196218 nor rs290487 showed a significant association. These results indicate that TCF7L2 is an important susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.

18166673|t|Electrophoretic techniques applied to the detection and analysis of the human microsatellite DG10s478.
18166673|a|Short nucleotide repetitions (STRs) are commonly used as genetic markers; thus their detection and analysis constitutes a very important tool for the mapping of genetic diseases, as well as for gathering information about genetic polymorphisms at the population level. STRs can be detected with agarose- or acrylamide-based electrophoretic techniques, followed by visualization of the DNA sample with ethidium bromide, silver nitrate, or fluorophore labeling. In this work, we analyzed genomic DNA from five individuals affected with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and five controls (unaffected individuals) in order to know the most precise and reproducible technique for the analysis of the existing polymorphism in the STR DG10S478 of the TCF7L2 gene. The combination of PCR with labeling of the products with the CY5 fluorophore, followed by detection on an ALFexpress sequencer, offered the required resolution to detect the variability in this STR, based solely on size analysis. Our methodology offers similar accuracy and reproducibility at lower costs than existing methods based on the sequencing of PCR products, and is a faster alternative when applied to genotyping studies.

18203713|t|The effects of myostatin on adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are mediated through cross-communication between Smad3 and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways.
18203713|a|The effects of myostatin on adipogenic differentiation are poorly understood, and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We determined the effects of human recombinant myostatin protein on adipogenesis of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived preadipocytes. For both progenitor cell types, differentiation in the presence of myostatin caused a dose-dependent reduction of lipid accumulation and diminished incorporation of exogenous fatty acid into cellular lipids. Myostatin significantly down-regulated the expression of adipocyte markers PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, leptin, and aP2, but not C/EBPbeta. Overexpression of PPARgamma, but not C/EBPbeta, blocked the inhibitory effects of myostatin on adipogenesis. Myostatin induced phosphorylation of Smad3 in hMSCs; knockdown of Smad3 by RNAi or inhibition of its upstream kinase by an Alk5 inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of myostatin on adipogenesis in hMSCs, implying an important role of Smad3 activation in this event. Furthermore, myostatin enhanced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and formation of the Smad3-beta-catenin-TCF4 complex, together with the altered expression of a number of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway genes in hMSCs. The inhibitory effects of myostatin on adipogenesis were blocked by RNAi silencing of beta-catenin and diminished by overexpression of dominant-negative TCF4. The conclusion is that myostatin inhibited adipogenesis in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes. These effects were mediated, in part, by activation of Smad3 and cross-communication of the TGFbeta/Smad signal to Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF4 pathway, leading to down-regulation of PPARgamma.

18210030|t|Analysis of novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes in a general French population: the D.E.S.I.R. study.
18210030|a|Recently, Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), highly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in several case-control studies of European descent. However, the impact of these markers on glucose homeostasis in a population-based study remains to be clarified. The French prospective D.E.S.I.R. study (N = 4,707) was genotyped for 22 polymorphisms within 14 loci showing nominal to strong association with T2D in recently published GWA analyses (CDKAL1, IGFBP2, CDKN2A/2B, EXT2, HHEX, LOC646279, SLC30A8, MMP26, KCTD12, LDLR, CAMTA1, LOC38776, NGN3 and CXCR4). We assessed their effects on quantitative traits related to glucose homeostasis in 4,283 normoglycemic middle-aged participants at baseline and their contribution to T2D incidence during 9 years of follow-up. Individuals carrying T2D risk alleles of CDKAL1 or SLC30A8 had lower fasting plasma insulin level (rs7756992 P = 0.003) or lower basal insulin secretion (rs13266634 P = 0.0005), respectively, than non-carriers. Furthermore, NGN3 and MMP26 risk alleles associated with higher fasting plasma glucose levels (rs10823406 P = 0.01 and rs2499953 P = 0.04, respectively). However, for these SNPs, only modest associations were found with a higher incidence of T2D: hazard ratios of 2.03 [1.00-4.11] for MMP26 (rs2499953 P = 0.05) and 1.33 [1.02-1.73] for NGN3 (rs10823406 P = 0.03). We confirmed deleterious effects of SLC30A8, CDKAL1, NGN3 and MMP26 risk alleles on glucose homeostasis in the D.E.S.I.R. prospective cohort. However, in contrast to TCF7L2, the contribution of novel loci to T2D incidence seems only modest in the general middle-aged French population and should be replicated in larger cohorts.

18216022|t|Glucagon-like peptide-1 activation of TCF7L2-dependent Wnt signaling enhances pancreatic beta cell proliferation.
18216022|a|The insulinotropic hormone GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a new therapeutic agent that preserves or restores pancreatic beta cell mass. We report that GLP-1 and its agonist, exendin-4 (Exd4), induce Wnt signaling in pancreatic beta cells, both isolated islets, and in INS-1 cells. Basal and GLP-1 agonist-induced proliferation of beta cells requires active Wnt signaling. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, determinants of cell proliferation, are up-regulated by Exd4. Basal endogenous Wnt signaling activity depends on Wnt frizzled receptors and the protein kinases Akt and GSK3beta but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, GLP-1 agonists enhance Wnt signaling via GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of Akt and beta cell independent of GSK3beta. Inhibition of Wnt signaling by small interfering RNAs to beta-catenin or a dominant-negative TCF7L2 decreases both basal and Exd4-induced beta cell proliferation. Wnt signaling appears to mediate GLP-1-induced beta cell proliferation raising possibilities for novel treatments of diabetes.

18230892|t|Polygenic contribution to obesity: genome-wide strategies reveal new targets.
18230892|a|Obesity results from the complex interaction of environmental factors that act on a genetic background that determines the susceptibility to obesity. The identification of such obesity susceptibility genes can provide important insights into the mechanism underlying this condition. While candidate gene approaches have not been tremendously successful in identifying relevant genetic contributors to obesity, except PPAR , the advent of genome-wide strategies has recently revealed novel and unexpected genetic factors with strong associations with obesity and/or diabetes, i.e. FTO, TCF7L2, INSIG2, ENPP1, or FASN (reviewed herein), although some of them are not undebated. Considering the function of the encoded proteins, it will now be of interest to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms, how these genetic variations affect body weight, energy metabolism and/or obesity-associated morbidity.

18239663|t|Effects of TCF7L2 polymorphisms on obesity in European populations.
18239663|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 T allele was previously associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and decreased BMI whereas haplotypes carrying the rs7903146 C and rs10885406 A alleles (HapA) were associated with increased BMI. The functional relevance of TCF7L2 polymorphisms and their effects on T2D and obesity remained to be further investigated. In white European populations, we found that the rs7903146 T allele was more associated with T2D in 3,547 non-obese individuals (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88 (1.69-2.10)) than in 1,110 class III obese subjects (OR = 1.24 (1.03-1.50)). No direct effect of the rs7903146 C allele and HapA was found on any form of obesity in 3,507 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) individuals, 1,106 pedigrees with familial obesity and 5,512 individuals from the French general population. However, in T2D subjects, the rs7903146 C allele was less prevalent in the 1,111 non-obese individuals (55.2%) compared to 659 class III obese subjects (67.5% OR = 1.69 (1.46-1.95)). Functional studies showed that the rs7903146 T allele is less prone to be bound by protein factors than the C allele in 3T3-L1, HepG2 and beta-TC3 cell lines and that TCF7L2 expression decreases in subcutaneous adipose tissue from NGT obese T/T carriers under calorie restriction. In conclusion, TCF7L2 is not a risk factor for obesity in European populations, but its effect on T2D risk is modulated by obesity. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rs7903146 T allele may be possibly functional and associated with a nominal decrease in TCF7L2 expression in adipose tissue of individuals under calorie restriction.

18248681|t|Prevalence of common disease-associated variants in Asian Indians.
18248681|a|BACKGROUND: Asian Indians display a high prevalence of diseases linked to changes in diet and environment that have arisen as their lifestyle has become more westernized. Using 1200 genome-wide polymorphisms in 432 individuals from 15 Indian language groups, we have recently shown that: (i) Indians constitute a distinct population-genetic cluster, and (ii) despite the geographic and linguistic diversity of the groups they exhibit a relatively low level of genetic heterogeneity. RESULTS: We investigated the prevalence of common polymorphisms that have been associated with diseases, such as atherosclerosis (ALOX5), hypertension (CYP3A5, AGT, GNB3), diabetes (CAPN10, TCF7L2, PTPN22), prostate cancer (DG8S737, rs1447295), Hirschsprung disease (RET), and age-related macular degeneration (CFH, LOC387715). In addition, we examined polymorphisms associated with skin pigmentation (SLC24A5) and with the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (TAS2R38). All polymorphisms were studied in a cohort of 576 India-born Asian Indians sampled in the United States. This sample consisted of individuals whose mother tongue is one of 14 of the 22 "official" languages recognized in India as well as individuals whose mother tongue is Parsi, a cultural group that has resided in India for over 1000 years. Analysis of the data revealed that allele frequency differences between the different Indian language groups were small, and interestingly the variant alleles of ALOX5 g.8322G>A and g.50778G>A, and PTPN22 g.36677C>T were present only in a subset of the Indian language groups. Furthermore, a latitudinal cline was identified both for the allele frequencies of the SNPs associated with hypertension (CYP3A5, AGT, GNB3), as well as for those associated with the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (TAS2R38). CONCLUSION: Although caution is warranted due to the fact that this US-sampled Indian cohort may not represent a random sample from India, our results will hopefully assist in the design of future studies that investigate the genetic causes of these diseases in India. Our results also support the inclusion of the Indian population in disease-related genetic studies, as it exhibits unique genotype as well as phenotype characteristics that may yield new insights into the underlying causes of common diseases that are not available in other populations.

18264689|t|Polymorphisms in the TCF7L2, CDKAL1 and SLC30A8 genes are associated with impaired proinsulin conversion.
18264689|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Variation within six novel genetic loci has been reported to confer risk of type 2 diabetes and may be associated with beta cell dysfunction. We investigated whether these polymorphisms are also associated with impaired proinsulin to insulin conversion. METHODS: We genotyped 1,065 German participants for single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 in TCF7L2, rs7754840 in CDKAL1, rs7923837 and rs1111875 in HHEX, rs13266634 in SLC30A8, rs10811661 in CDKN2A/B and rs4402960 in IGF2BP2. All participants underwent an OGTT. Insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide concentrations were measured at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min during the OGTT. Insulin secretion was estimated from C-peptide or insulin levels during the OGTT using validated indices. We used the ratio proinsulin/insulin during the OGTT as indicator of proinsulin conversion. RESULTS: In our cohort, we confirmed the significant association of variants in TCF7L2, CDKAL1 and HHEX with reduced insulin secretion during the OGTT (p<0.05 for all). Variation in SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B and IGF2BP2 was not associated with insulin secretion. The risk alleles of the variants in TCF7L2, CDKAL1 and SLC30A8 reduced proinsulin to insulin conversion (p<0.05 for all), whereas the risk alleles in HHEX, CDKN2A/B and IGF2BP2 were not associated with reduced proinsulin to insulin conversion (p>0.6). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes-associated variants in TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 impair insulin secretion and conversion of proinsulin to insulin. However, both aspects of beta cell function are not necessarily linked, as impaired insulin secretion is specifically present in variants of HHEX and impaired proinsulin conversion is specifically present in a variant of SLC30A8.

18268068|t|Variation in TCF7L2 and increased risk of colon cancer: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.
18268068|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, which influences diabetes risk, is associated with incidence of cancers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We related diabetes and TCF7L2 variation with occurrence of several common cancers in a prospective cohort study of 13,117 middle-aged adults initially free of cancer in 1987-1989. We assessed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TCF7L2 including the putative SNP (rs7903146) for diabetes. We identified incident cancers through 2000 via cancer registries, supplemented by hospital records. RESULTS: Diabetes was associated marginally inversely with incidence of prostate cancer but not with incidence of colorectal, colon, lung, or breast cancer. The T allele of rs7903146 (frequency 30%) was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and, more specifically, colon cancer, with adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.0 for CC, 1.25 (0.85-1.83) for CT, and 2.15 (1.27-3.64) for TT genotypes (P(trend) = 0.009). TCF7L2 variation also was associated with lung cancer incidence in whites but not blacks, but residual confounding by smoking may be present. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who were initially cancer-free and carrying certain genetic variants of TCF7L2, most notably the T allele of rs7903146, have an increased risk of colon cancer. This association appears to be an independent gene effect not explained by diabetes. Because the T allele of rs7903146 is common, if a causal link is established, this variant could account for a sizable proportion ( approximately 17% here) of cases of colon cancer in the general population.

18282631|t|Association of TCF7L2 polymorphism with diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and markers of beta cell function and insulin resistance in a population-based sample of Emirati subjects.
18282631|a|AIMS: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) among Emirati subjects is one of the highest in the world. This has been attributed to rising prevalence of obesity acting on genetically susceptible individuals. We analyzed the associations between TCF7L2 polymorphism and DM, metabolic syndrome, and markers of beta cell function and insulin resistance in a population-based sample of Emirati subjects. METHODS: We genotyped the two TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12255372 and rs7903146 in 368 adult subjects. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to assess beta cell function (HOMA2-%B) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). The SNP genotypes were analyzed against disease stage [normal glucose=0 (n=188), pre-diabetes=1 (n=85), and DM=2 (n=95)] and against clinical and biochemical measures. Age and sex were included as covariates in all association analyses. Additional adjustments were made for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in several analyses. RESULTS: Diabetes disease stage was marginally significantly associated with the frequency of the T variant at rs12255372 (p=0.057; adjusted p=0.017) but not at rs7903146 (p=0.5; adjusted p=0.2). Comparison between subjects with normal glucose and the combined DM/pre-diabetes showed a significant association with rs12255372 (OR 1.47, CI 1.04-2.08; p=0.03) but not with rs7903146 (OR 1.16, CI 0.81-1.64; p=0.4). We found no association with metabolic syndrome, or with insulin and glucose levels, HOMA2-%B or HOMA2-IR. The age-standardized prevalence rate for metabolic syndrome was 43.9% in men and 42.1% in women. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TCF7L2 variants are associated with increased risk for DM in Emirati subjects. We also demonstrate a high prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in this population.

18291022|t|Common variants of the TCF7L2 gene are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a UK-resident South Asian population.
18291022|a|BACKGROUND: Recent studies have implicated variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in several different populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether variants of this gene are also risk factors for type 2 diabetes development in a UK-resident South Asian cohort of Punjabi ancestry. METHODS: We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2 (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372) in 831 subjects with diabetes and 437 control subjects. RESULTS: The minor allele of each variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes; the greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.11 - 1.56, p = 1.96 x 10(-3)). For each variant, disease risk associated with homozygosity for the minor allele was greater than that for heterozygotes, with the exception of rs12255372. To determine the effect on the observed associations of including young control subjects in our data set, we reanalysed the data using subsets of the control group defined by different minimum age thresholds. Increasing the minimum age of our control subjects resulted in a corresponding increase in OR for all variants of the gene (p < or= 1.04 x 10(-7)). CONCLUSION: Our results support recent findings that TCF7L2 is an important genetic risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes in multiple ethnic groups.

18302196|t|Evaluation of a variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and prostate cancer risk in a population-based study.
18302196|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a high mobility group-box containing protein that is a critical member of the Wnt/beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway. In addition to its recently recognized role in diabetes, aberrant TCF7L2 expression has been implicated in cancer through regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis by c-MYC and cyclin D. It has been hypothesized that germline variants within the TCF7L2 gene previously associated with diabetes may affect cancer risk through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Specifically, the same risk allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12255372 that is associated with diabetes (T allele) has recently been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. METHODS: Here, we investigated associations between rs12255372 and prostate cancer risk among 1,457 cases and 1,351 controls from a population-based study. RESULTS: The variant TT genotype was not associated with overall prostate cancer risk. However, there was evidence that men homozygous for the variant T allele had an elevated relative risk of more aggressive prostate cancer, as defined by high Gleason score (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8) or regional/distant stage (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.6) disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that this variant in the TCF7L2 gene may be associated with risk of developing more clinically significant disease. These results need to be confirmed, but provide initial evidence that the TCF7L2 gene may alter risk of developing more aggressive prostate cancer.

18310307|t|Genetic similarities between latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes.
18310307|a|OBJECTIVE: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is often considered a slowly progressing subtype of type 1 diabetes, although the clinical picture more resembles type 2 diabetes. One way to improve classification is to study whether LADA shares genetic features with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To accomplish this, we studied whether LADA shares variation in the HLA locus or INS VNTR and PTPN22 genes with type 1 diabetes or the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes in 361 LADA, 718 type 1 diabetic, and 1,676 type 2 diabetic patients, as well as 1,704 healthy control subjects from Sweden and Finland. RESULTS: LADA subjects showed, compared with type 2 diabetic patients, increased frequency of risk for the HLA-DQB1 *0201/*0302 genotype (27 vs. 6.9%; P < 1 x 10(-6)), with similar frequency as with type 1 diabetes (36%). In addition, LADA subjects showed higher frequencies of protective HLA-DQB1 *0602(3)/X than type 1 diabetic patients (8.1 vs. 3.2%, P = 0.003). The AA genotype of rs689, referring to the class I allele in the INS VNTR, as well as the CT/TT genotypes of rs2476601 in the PTPN22 gene, were increased both in type 1 diabetic (P = 3 x 10(-14) and P = 1 x 10(-10), respectively) and LADA (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002) subjects compared with control subjects. Notably, the frequency of the type 2 diabetes-associated CT/TT genotypes of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 were increased in LADA subjects (52.8%; P = 0.03), to the same extent as in type 2 diabetic subjects (54.1%, P = 3 x 10(-7)), compared with control subjects (44.8%) and type 1 diabetic subjects (43.3%). CONCLUSIONS: LADA shares genetic features with both type 1 (HLA, INS VNTR, and PTPN22) and type 2 (TCF7L2) diabetes, which justifies considering LADA as an admixture of the two major types of diabetes.

18342627|t|Expression of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) in human adipocytes is down regulated by insulin.
18342627|a|Variants in the TCF7L2 gene (transcription factor 7-like 2) have shown strong association with type 2 diabetes with two defined risk haplotypes, HapA and HapB(T2D). TCF7L2 may play a role in both glucose homeostasis and adipogenesis. Our aim was to characterize the TCF7L2 mRNA expression and regulation in human adipose tissue. We quantified TCF7L2 mRNA levels in cultured human adipocytes and in biopsies from visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue from 38 obese non-diabetic subjects, using real-time PCR. The influence of haplotype and clinical traits on TCF7L2 mRNA levels were investigated. In vitro, insulin decreased TCF7L2 mRNA expression. This effect was attenuated in cells incubated with the free fatty acids palmitate or oleate. In vivo, we found significantly higher expression in SAT from more insulin resistant subjects. No correlations between TCF7L2 mRNA expression and obesity measures were observed. TCF7L2 expression was higher in VAT than in SAT and when stratifying for haplotype, this difference was seen in HapA carriers but not in non-HapA carriers. In conclusion, TCF7L2 mRNA levels in adipocytes are decreased by insulin and seem to increase in insulin resistant subjects and in HapA carriers.

18397358|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes in Khatri Sikhs from North India: genetic variation affects lipid levels.
18397358|a|Recently, the transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been identified as the most important type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility gene. Common intronic polymorphisms in this gene have been found to be strongly associated with T2DM susceptibility showing marked reproducibility in multiple populations. The purpose of this study was to confirm the reported association of six TCF7L2 variants in a Khatri Sikh diabetic sample from North India. We genotyped six-associated SNPs in a case-control sample consisting of 556 T2DM cases and 537 controls. We also examined the impact of these variants on body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting insulin, and glucose and lipid levels. We report replication of association of four of the six SNPs with T2DM in this Khatri Sikh sample [rs7903146, (p = 0.010); rs11196205, (p = 0.011); rs10885409, (p = 0.002) and rs4918789, (p = 0.029)], under a dominant model conferring odds ratios (ORs) of 1.39, 1.44, 1.57 and 1.36, respectively. Haplotype analysis provided further evidence of association by showing a significant difference between cases and controls as revealed by the global omnibus test (chi(2)= 19.36; p = 0.0036). Multiple linear regression analysis also revealed the risk allele carriers of three of four significant SNPs (rs7903146, rs11196205, rs10885409) to be significantly associated with increased fasting total cholesterol (p value = 0.019, 0.025, 0.006) and LDL cholesterol levels (p value = 0.021, 0.018, 0.005), respectively. Our findings confirm that the TCF7L2 gene is a major risk factor for development of T2DM in Khatri Sikhs. It also provides new information about the significant impact of TCF7L2 gene variants on plasma cholesterol levels that appear to be independent of BMI.

18398040|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphism and colon cancer.
18398040|a|Polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been associated with insulin sensitivity and diabetes, and the TCF7L2 gene is involved in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, all factors thought to be important in the etiology of colon cancer. In this confirmatory study, we evaluated the rs7903146 TCF7L2 polymorphism with colon cancer using previously collected data on 1,578 cases and 1,966 controls. We did not observe a statistically significant association between the rs7903146 polymorphisms and risk of colon cancer [odds ratio (OR), 1.12; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.98-1.28] when evaluating the total population. We did, however, observe a statistically significant interaction between the rs7903146 TCF7L2 polymorphism and recent use of aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; P = 0.001). Increased colon cancer risk associated with the T allele was restricted to those without recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.35-2.02, relative to recent aspirin users, i.e., use of aspirin/NSAIDS within the 2 years before diagnosis, with the CC genotype). Among individuals who reported recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs, the T allele reduced risk of colon cancer (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98) in a dose-response fashion (P for linear trend across genotypes = 0.03). These data suggest that colon cancer risk associated with the rs7903146 TCF7L2 polymorphism is modified by use of aspirin/NSAIDs.

18437354|t|TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.
18437354|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesised that TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and that the associations differ in diabetic and non-diabetic persons. METHODS: Our analysis included black and white participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study who were free of prevalent CVD at baseline and had been genotyped for rs7903146, rs12255372, rs7901695, rs11196205 and rs7895340 (n=13,369). Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the associations between polymorphisms and incident events; logistic and linear regression were used for associations with baseline risk factor levels. RESULTS: TCF7L2 SNPs were not significantly associated with incident coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, CVD, prevalent peripheral artery disease (PAD) or all-cause mortality in the full cohort or when stratified by race. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the whole cohort, TCF7L2 SNPs were not associated with incident CVD, all-cause mortality or prevalent PAD. This result suggests that the increased health risk associated with rs7903146 genotype is specific to diabetes.

18443202|t|Association analysis in african americans of European-derived type 2 diabetes single nucleotide polymorphisms from whole-genome association studies.
18443202|a|OBJECTIVE: Several whole-genome association studies have reported identification of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in various European-derived study populations. Little investigation of these loci has been reported in other ethnic groups, specifically African Americans. Striking differences exist between these populations, suggesting they may not share identical genetic risk factors. Our objective was to examine the influence of type 2 diabetes genes identified in whole-genome association studies in a large African American case-control population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 loci (e.g., TCF7L2, IDE/KIF11/HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, PKN2, IGF2BP2, FLJ39370, and EXT2/ALX4) associated with type 2 diabetes in European-derived populations were genotyped in 993 African American type 2 diabetic and 1,054 African American control subjects. Additionally, 68 ancestry-informative markers were genotyped to account for the impact of admixture on association results. RESULTS: Little evidence of association was observed between SNPs, with the exception of those in TCF7L2, and type 2 diabetes in African Americans. One TCF7L2 SNP (rs7903146) showed compelling evidence of association with type 2 diabetes (admixture-adjusted additive P [P(a)] = 1.59 x 10(-6)). Only the intragenic SNP on 11p12 (rs9300039, dominant P [P(d)] = 0.029) was also associated with type 2 diabetes after admixture adjustments. Interestingly, four of the SNPs are monomorphic in the Yoruba population of the HAPMAP project, with only the risk allele from the populations of European descent present. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that these variants do not significantly contribute to interindividual susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in African Americans. Consequently, genes contributing to type 2 diabetes in African Americans may, in part, be different from those in European-derived study populations. High frequency of risk alleles in several of these genes may, however, contribute to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in African Americans.

18445358|t|TCF7L2 genetic defect and type 2 diabetes.
18445358|a|After two decades of limited success, the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is finally being revealed. Within only 2 years, an avalanche of studies identified several genes expressed in pancreatic beta cells and involved in the control of insulin secretion, such as transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), a key element of the Wnt signaling pathway. In Europeans, genome-wide association scans showed that TCF7L2 has been the most important locus predisposing to T2D so far. For the first time, a gene is consistently involved in T2D susceptibility in all major ethnic groups. At the individual level, carrying the TCF7L2 risk allele increases T2D risk 50%. However, at the population level, the attributable risk is lower than 25% and varies with the allele frequency. The presence of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk allele increases TCF7L2 gene expression in beta cells, possibly impairing glucagon-like peptide-1-induced insulin secretion and/or the production of new mature beta cells. The tremendous association of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with T2D provides new insights into future genetic predisposition tests but remains the tip of the T2D genetic iceberg.

18461161|t|Post genome-wide association studies of novel genes associated with type 2 diabetes show gene-gene interaction and high predictive value.
18461161|a|BACKGROUND: Recently, several Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies in populations of European descent have identified and validated novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), highly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aims were to validate these markers in other European and non-European populations, then to assess their combined effect in a large French study comparing T2D and normal glucose tolerant (NGT) individuals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the same French population analyzed in our previous GWA study (3,295 T2D and 3,595 NGT), strong associations with T2D were found for CDKAL1 (OR(rs7756992) = 1.30[1.19-1.42], P = 2.3x10(-9)), CDKN2A/2B (OR(rs10811661) = 0.74[0.66-0.82], P = 3.5x10(-8)) and more modestly for IGFBP2 (OR(rs1470579) = 1.17[1.07-1.27], P = 0.0003) SNPs. These results were replicated in both Israeli Ashkenazi (577 T2D and 552 NGT) and Austrian (504 T2D and 753 NGT) populations (except for CDKAL1) but not in the Moroccan population (521 T2D and 423 NGT). In the overall group of French subjects (4,232 T2D and 4,595 NGT), IGFBP2 and CXCR4 synergistically interacted with (LOC38776, SLC30A8, HHEX) and (NGN3, CDKN2A/2B), respectively, encoding for proteins presumably regulating pancreatic endocrine cell development and function. The T2D risk increased strongly when risk alleles, including the previously discovered T2D-associated TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP, were combined (8.68-fold for the 14% of French individuals carrying 18 to 30 risk alleles with an allelic OR of 1.24). With an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, only 15 novel loci were necessary to discriminate French individuals susceptible to develop T2D. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to TCF7L2, SLC30A8 and HHEX, initially identified by the French GWA scan, CDKAL1, IGFBP2 and CDKN2A/2B strongly associate with T2D in French individuals, and mostly in populations of Central European descent but not in Moroccan subjects. Genes expressed in the pancreas interact together and their combined effect dramatically increases the risk for T2D, opening avenues for the development of genetic prediction tests.

18469204|t|Implication of genetic variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, and FTO in type 2 diabetes and obesity in 6,719 Asians.
18469204|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified six novel genes for type 2 diabetes and obesity and confirmed TCF7L2 as the major type 2 diabetes gene to date in Europeans. However, the implications of these genes in Asians are unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 13 associated single nucleotide polymorphisms from these genes in 3,041 patients with type 2 diabetes and 3,678 control subjects of Asian ancestry from Hong Kong and Korea. RESULTS: We confirmed the associations of TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, and FTO with risk for type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios ranging from 1.13 to 1.35 (1.3 x 10(-12) < P(unadjusted) < 0.016). In addition, the A allele of rs8050136 at FTO was associated with increased BMI in the control subjects (P(unadjusted) = 0.008). However, we did not observe significant association of any genetic variants with surrogate measures of insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity indexes in a subset of 2,662 control subjects. Compared with subjects carrying zero, one, or two risk alleles, each additional risk allele was associated with 17% increased risk, and there was an up to 3.3-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes in those carrying eight or more risk alleles. Despite most of the effect sizes being similar between Asians and Europeans in the meta-analyses, the ethnic differences in risk allele frequencies in most of these genes lead to variable attributable risks in these two populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the important but differential contribution of these genetic variants to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Asians compared with Europeans.

18478343|t|Association of the TCF7L2 polymorphism with colorectal cancer and adenoma risk.
18478343|a|We evaluated the association of a polymorphism in TCF7L2 (RS12255372) in the WNT signaling pathway, which previously has been strongly associated with risk of Type II Diabetes, with colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma in the prospective Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) cohorts. Hyperinsulinemia may be related to the risk of colon adenoma and cancer, therefore this variant associated with reduced insulin secretion would be predicted to be inversely associated with colorectal cancer. Overall, in the NHS and HPFS, there was suggestive evidence for an inverse association associated with homozygosity for the minor allele of RS12255372 (TCF7L2 TT) and CRC (conditional and covariate adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.37-1.08; P for heterogeneity 0.52 for the association in women and men). In summary, the marginal association of the TCF7L2 SNP with CRC might be due to chance, but warrants further laboratory and epidemiological investigation.

18481957|t|TCF7L2 controls insulin gene expression and insulin secretion in mature pancreatic beta-cells.
18481957|a|Genetic studies have linked the risk of Type 2 diabetes with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the gene encoding the Wnt signalling-associated transcription factor, TCF7L2 (T-cell factor 7-like 2). The risk alleles have been associated with reduced glucose and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1)-stimulated insulin secretion. Recent evidence has suggested that inheritance of the at-risk T allele at SNP rs7903146 may increase the expression of TCF7L2 in adult human islets. However, the cellular mechanisms by which changes in TCF7L2 levels may affect insulin secretion are unclear. In the present paper, we describe the use of RNA silencing to investigate the role of TCF7L2 on insulin secretion and gene expression in rodent islets. We find that reduced TCF7L2 expression reduces glucose-simulated insulin secretion and insulin gene expression while slightly potentiating glucose stimulated changes in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations.

18493736|t|Exon sequencing and association analysis of polymorphisms in TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population.
18493736|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recently, variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been found to be consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in different populations. In this study, we hypothesized that TCF7L2 also contributed to genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. METHODS: We looked for new variants by direct sequencing of all exons and intron-exon junctions of TCF7L2 in 100 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, and then we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by Snapshot technology in 1,000 Chinese individuals. RESULTS: By sequencing, we identified six SNPs (c.1,637C>A; c.1,674C>G; c.1,709G>A; c.1,846C>G; c.1,888C>T; and c.1,876T>G), and three of them led to non-synonymous polymorphisms (c.1,637C>A, His-->Gln or Pro-->Thr; c.1,674C>G, Pro-->Arg; and c.1,709G>A, Ala-->Thr). All of them are rare except c.1,637C>A, which had a frequency of 0.23 for the minor A allele in 98 sequenced individuals. In a case-control study, one of the newly discovered SNPs (c.1,637C>A), together with four reported ones (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs290487 and rs3814573) were genotyped. Comparison between allele and genotype frequencies of these SNPs in patients and controls showed marginal association for rs7903146 and rs290487 with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.063, OR 1.982, 95% CI 1.128-3.485; p = 0.071, OR 1.237, 95% CI 0.983-1.557, respectively). No association was found for rs12255372, rs3814573, c.1,637C>A and type 2 diabetes (p = 0.278-1.000). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: With the current sample size, we did not find any mutation in the coding sequence of TCF7L2 that confers a genetic risk for type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population, and did not replicate some of the major positive results obtained in other populations.

18498634|t|The genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes may be modulated by obesity status: implications for association studies.
18498634|a|BACKGROUND: Considering that a portion of the heterogeneity amongst previous replication studies may be due to a variable proportion of obese subjects in case-control designs, we assessed the association of genetic variants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in large groups of obese and non-obese subjects. METHODS: We genotyped RETN, KCNJ11, HNF4A, HNF1A, GCK, SLC30A8, ENPP1, ADIPOQ, PPARG, and TCF7L2 polymorphisms in 1,283 normoglycemic (NG) and 1,581 T2D obese individuals as well as in 3,189 NG and 1,244 T2D non-obese subjects of European descent, allowing us to examine T2D risk over a wide range of BMI. RESULTS: Amongst non-obese individuals, we observed significant T2D associations with HNF1A I27L [odds ratio (OR) = 1.14, P = 0.04], GCK -30G>A (OR = 1.23, P = 0.01), SLC30A8 R325W (OR = 0.87, P = 0.04), and TCF7L2 rs7903146 (OR = 1.89, P = 4.5 x 10-23), and non-significant associations with PPARG Pro12Ala (OR = 0.85, P = 0.14), ADIPOQ -11,377C>G (OR = 1.00, P = 0.97) and ENPP1 K121Q (OR = 0.99, P = 0.94). In obese subjects, associations with T2D were detected with PPARG Pro12Ala (OR = 0.73, P = 0.004), ADIPOQ -11,377C>G (OR = 1.26, P = 0.02), ENPP1 K121Q (OR = 1.30, P = 0.003) and TCF7L2 rs7903146 (OR = 1.30, P = 1.1 x 10-4), and non-significant associations with HNF1A I27L (OR = 0.96, P = 0.53), GCK -30G>A (OR = 1.15, P = 0.12) and SLC30A8 R325W (OR = 0.95, P = 0.44). However, a genotypic heterogeneity was only found for TCF7L2 rs7903146 (P = 3.2 x 10-5) and ENPP1 K121Q (P = 0.02). No association with T2D was found for KCNJ11, RETN, and HNF4A polymorphisms in non-obese or in obese individuals. CONCLUSION: Genetic variants modulating insulin action may have an increased effect on T2D susceptibility in the presence of obesity, whereas genetic variants acting on insulin secretion may have a greater impact on T2D susceptibility in non-obese individuals.

18498660|t|Polymorphisms near EXOC4 and LRGUK on chromosome 7q32 are associated with Type 2 Diabetes and fasting glucose; the NHLBI Family Heart Study.
18498660|a|BACKGROUND: The chromosome 7q32 region is linked to metabolic syndrome and obesity related traits in the Family Heart Study. As part of a fine mapping study of the region, we evaluated the relationship of polymorphisms to fasting glucose levels and Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-nine HapMap defined tag SNPs in a 1.08 Mb region and a novel deletion polymorphism were genotyped in 2,603 participants of the NHLBI Family Heart Study (FHS). Regression modeling, adjusting for BMI, age, sex, smoking and the TCF7L2 polymorphism, was used to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with T2D and fasting glucoses levels. RESULTS: The deletion polymorphism confers a protective effect for T2D, with homozygous deletion carriers having a 53% reduced risk compared to non-deleted carriers. Among non-diabetics, the deletion was significantly associated with lower fasting glucose levels in men (p = 0.038) but not women (p = 0.118). In addition, seven SNPs near the deletion were significantly associated (p < 0.01) to diabetes. CONCLUSION: Chromosome 7q32 contains both SNPs and a deletion that were associated to T2D. Although the deletion region contains several islands of strongly conserved sequence, it is not known to contain a transcribed gene. The closest nearby gene, EXOC4, is involved in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and may be a candidate for this association. Further work is needed to determine if the deletion represents a functional variant or may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional mutation influencing EXOC4 or another nearby gene.

18504548|t|Newly identified loci highlight beta cell dysfunction as a key cause of type 2 diabetes: where are the insulin resistance genes?
18504548|a|Although type 2 diabetes has been traditionally understood as a metabolic disorder initiated by insulin resistance, it has recently become apparent that an impairment in insulin secretion contributes to its manifestation and may play a prominent role in its early pathophysiology. The genetic dissection of Mendelian and, more recently, polygenic types of diabetes confirms the notion that primary defects in insulin synthesis, processing and/or secretion often give rise to the common form of this disorder. This concept, first advanced with the discovery and physiological characterisation of various genetic subtypes of MODY, has been extended to other forms of monogenic diabetes (e.g. neonatal diabetes). It has also led to the identification of common risk variants via candidate gene approaches (e.g. the E23K polymorphism in KCNJ11 or common variants in the MODY genes), and it has been validated by the description of the robust physiological effects conferred by polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene. More recently, the completion and integration of genome-wide association scans for this disease has uncovered a number of heretofore unsuspected variants, several of which also affect insulin secretion. This review provides an up-to-date account of genetic loci that influence risk of common type 2 diabetes via impairment of beta cell function, outlines their presumed mechanisms of action, and places them in the context of gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions. Finally, a strategy for the analogous discovery of insulin resistance genes is proposed.

18512226|t|A further example of a distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome comprising neonatal diabetes mellitus, intestinal atresias and gall bladder agenesis.
18512226|a|We report a patient born to consanguineous parents as a further example of a recently described phenotype comprising neonatal diabetes, intestinal atresias and gall bladder agenesis. Other reports have described cases with overlapping patterns including malrotation, biliary atresia and pancreatic hypoplasia (e.g. as described by Mart  nez-Fr  as). We propose that these cases may represent variations of the same syndrome. It is likely that this disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Our case is the first to have neonatal diabetes without a demonstrable structural pancreatic abnormality, showing that a deficit in pancreatic function is involved. We sequenced genes with a recognized role in monogenic forms of diabetes, including KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, IPF1, HNF1beta, NeuroD1 and TCF7L2, as well as a novel candidate gene, HNF6, known to be involved in hepatobiliary and pancreatic development, but did not identify mutations.

18541994|t|New gene variants alter type 2 diabetes risk predominantly through reduced beta-cell function.
18541994|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past 18 months, the number of gene loci robustly associated with type 2 diabetes has risen from three to 18. In this study, we focus on explaining the genome-wide approach that has led to most of these discoveries and discuss some of the early insights the new gene loci have provided into the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent genome-wide association studies have provided an important resource for furthering our understanding of type 2 diabetes disease mechanisms. Genes previously unsuspected of playing a role in diabetes are now implicated in the disease process. These include genes in cell cycling control (CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1), transcription factors (TCF7L2, HHEX), and ion channels (SLC30A8). These variants are all associated with insulin-secretory defects in the general population and show little if any relationship to insulin resistance. Two common variants (near or in FTO and MC4R) alter diabetes risk through a primary effect on obesity. SUMMARY: Recent genome-wide association studies show that there are now 18 gene loci associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Most of these T2D gene loci affect insulin secretion.

18541996|t|The transcription factor 7-like 2 gene and increased risk of type 2 diabetes: an update.
18541996|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the most important type 2 diabetes gene to date, transcription factor 7 like-2. RECENT FINDINGS: An important step to find genetic causes of type 2 diabetes in 2006 was the identification of the fact that variants in the gene encoding transcription factor 7 like-2 reproducibly increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in almost all populations studied. This gene has since then emerged as the most important type 2 diabetes gene. Genetic variants in transcription factor 7 like-2 confer a strong risk of type 2 diabetes possibly mediated by altering expression of transcription factor 7 like-2 in pancreatic islets. Risk variants in the transcription factor 7 like-2 influence insulin secretions both in vitro and in vivo. The risk T allele of this single nucleotide polymorphism also seems to have effects on the enteroinsular axis and the relationship between the incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and its target hormones, glucagon and insulin. Given transcription factor 7 like-2s' central role in the Wnt signaling pathway, it would be important to define whether the variant is associated with increased or decreased Wnt signaling. SUMMARY: The fact that transcription factor 7 like-2 is by far the strongest type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene to date emphasizes the importance of exploring the potential of manipulating this pathway in future treatment of the disease.

18546086|t|TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and predisposition for type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese children.
18546086|a|Polymorphism RS7903146 in transcription factor 7-like2 gene ( TCF7L2) is associated with type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults. Concerned with predisposition for diabetes mellitus in obese children, we tested if risk genotypes TC and TT of rs7903146 are more common in obese children with increased homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) compared to obese controls with normal HOMA-IR. As exploratory analysis, we also calculated beta-cell function for these risk genotypes and measured glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in a subgroup. The cohort was 401 obese children (BMI > 2SDS; 211 female; 59% presenting increased HOMA-IR) from two German outpatient obesity referral centers. Genotype distributions in patients presenting increased HOMA-IR (TT: 10.18%, CT: 35.65%, CC: 54.17%) and in patients with normal HOMA-IR (TT: 8.66%, CT: 42.67%, CC: 48.67%) provided no significant effect of these two risk genotypes (p > 0.2). Correction for possible confounder's gender, age, pubertal stage, and BMI revealed no association with glucose metabolism parameters including GLP-1. However, exploratory HOMA-B% index was comparatively higher in TT-homozygotes (p=0.021) as compared to CC-homozygotes. We conclude that even though TT and CT genotypes were not higher in patients presenting elevated HOMA-IR, the higher HOMA-B% index in TT-homozygotes indicates TCF7L2 to be a susceptibility gene for the development of impaired glucose tolerance in obese children as demonstrated in several adult cohort studies.

18555673|t|The effect of WNT5B IVS3C>G on the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in UK Caucasian subjects.
18555673|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The wnt signaling pathway regulates adipogenesis and insulin secretion. The WNT5B gene has been reported to confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Japanese population, and we therefore evaluated this in Caucasian subjects with respect to obesity status. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two thousand seven hundred and one Caucasian middle-aged men from the prospective Northwick Park Heart Study II (NPHSII) of whom 153 developed T2D over 15 years and 1268 Caucasian middle-aged patients with T2D (60% male) were genotyped using a TaqMan assay for the IVS3C>G variant (rs2270031) in the WNT5B gene. The frequency of the G allele was 0.026 (0.022-0.031) in controls and 0.031 (0.025-0.039) in patients with diabetes, p=0.24. In the prospective analysis, G allele carriers with BMI below 26 kg/m(2) had significantly higher T2D hazard risk [3.46 (1.34-8.96), p=0.01]. Comparing T2D cases with NPHSII controls, the G allele was associated with a significantly higher T2D odds ratio (OR) of 1.50 (1.06-2.12), p=0.02 in subjects with BMI lower than 30 kg/m(2). Increasing BMI had a smaller effect on risk in G allele carriers. The effect on risk was not explained by genotype being associated with any classical T2D risk factor. When the combined effect of this SNP and the TCF7L2 IVS3C>T SNP (rs7903146) was evaluated, a 2.07 (1.40-3.07), p<0.0001 fold higher OR was observed in carriers of both the rare alleles. CONCLUSION: Variation in WNT5B predisposes to T2D in the absence of obesity. The increase in risk conferred by the presence of both WNT5B and TCF7L2 variants strengthens the role of wnt signaling in T2D.

18597214|t|Variants of the PPARG, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, HHEX, and TCF7L2 genes confer risk of type 2 diabetes independently of BMI in the German KORA studies.
18597214|a|Genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified novel gene variants that are associated with type 2 diabetes. However, results were not always consistent across different populations. Thus, the aims of this study were (i) to replicate findings from previous GWA studies in mainly Northern European populations using data from the German KORA 500 K diabetes project and (ii) to assess the impact of BMI on associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and type 2 diabetes. The KORA 500 K diabetes project includes 433 cases with validated type 2 diabetes and 1 438 nondiabetic controls from two population-based KORA surveys. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K Array Set. We investigated associations between SNPs and type 2 diabetes in 10 genes that have been reported to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or were in complete or near-complete linkage disequilibrium with these variants. SNPs in the CDKAL1 gene showed the strongest association with type 2 diabetes [range of age and sex-adjusted odds ratios (OR): 1.30-1.39, p-values 0.0008-0.0004]. In addition, we found evidence for association of SNPs in the genes PPARG, IGF2BP2, HHEX, TCF7L2, and FTO with type 2 diabetes in the same directions as previously described (p<0.05), but not for WFS1, CDKN2A/B, KCNJ11, or EXT2. Adjustment for BMI slightly strengthened the link between CDKAL1 and type 2 diabetes, but had almost no impact on the other associations. We conclude that gene variants of CDKAL1, PPARG, IGF2BP2, HHEX, TCF7L2, and FTO predispose to type 2 diabetes in the German KORA 500 K study population. These associations appear to be independent of BMI.

18598350|t|Impact of nine common type 2 diabetes risk polymorphisms in Asian Indian Sikhs: PPARG2 (Pro12Ala), IGF2BP2, TCF7L2 and FTO variants confer a significant risk.
18598350|a|BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified several unsuspected genes associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with previously unknown functions. In this investigation, we have examined the role of 9 most significant SNPs reported in GWA studies: [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARG2; rs 1801282); insulin-like growth factor two binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2; rs 4402960); cyclin-dependent kinase 5, a regulatory subunit-associated protein1-like 1 (CDK5; rs7754840); a zinc transporter and member of solute carrier family 30 (SLC30A8; rs13266634); a variant found near cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A; rs10811661); hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX; rs 1111875); transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2; rs 10885409); potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 11(KCNJ11; rs 5219); and fat mass obesity-associated gene (FTO; rs 9939609)]. METHODS: We genotyped these SNPs in a case-control sample of 918 individuals consisting of 532 T2D cases and 386 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects of an Asian Sikh community from North India. We tested the association between T2D and each SNP using unconditional logistic regression before and after adjusting for age, gender, and other covariates. We also examined the impact of these variants on body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting insulin, and glucose and lipid levels using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Four of the nine SNPs revealed a significant association with T2D; PPARG2 (Pro12Ala) [odds ratio (OR) 0.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.03-0.52); p = 0.005], IGF2BP2 [OR 1.37; 95% CI (1.04-1.82); p = 0.027], TCF7L2 [OR 1.64; 95% CI (1.20-2.24); p = 0.001] and FTO [OR 1.46; 95% CI (1.11-1.93); p = 0.007] after adjusting for age, sex and BMI. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant association of two of nine investigated loci with diabetes-related quantitative traits. The 'C' (risk) allele of CDK5 (rs 7754840) was significantly associated with decreased HDL-cholesterol levels in both NGT (p = 0.005) and combined (NGT and T2D) (0.005) groups. The less common 'C' (risk) allele of TCF7L2 (rs 10885409) was associated with increased LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.010) in NGT and total and LDL-cholesterol levels (p = 0.008; p = 0.003, respectively) in combined cohort. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is first study reporting the role of some recently emerged loci with T2D in a high risk population of Asian Indian origin. Further investigations are warranted to understand the pathway-based functional implications of these important loci in T2D pathophysiology in different ethnicities.

18599616|t|The Wnt signaling pathway effector TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
18599616|a|Since the relationship between TCF7L2 (also known as TCF-4) polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes mellitus was identified in 2006, extensive genome-wide association examinations in different ethnic groups have further confirmed this relationship. As a component of the bipartite transcription factor beta-catenin/TCF, TCF7L2 is important in conveying Wnt signaling during embryonic development and in regulating gene expression during adulthood. Although we still do not know mechanistically how the polymorphisms within the intron regions of TCF7L2 affect the risk of type 2 diabetes, this transcriptional regulator was shown to be involved in stimulating the proliferation of pancreatic beta-cells and the production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 in intestinal endocrine L cells. In this review, we introduce background knowledge of TCF7L2 as a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, summarize recent findings demonstrating the association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and the risk of type 2 diabetes, outline experimental evidence of the potential function of TCF7L2 in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells, and present our perspective views.

18611970|t|Impact of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on insulin secretion and action in young and elderly Danish twins.
18611970|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the regulation and metabolic effects of TCF7L2 gene expression in human sc fat and skeletal muscle and the impact of the TCF7L2, rs7903146, T-allele on gene expression and measures of glucose metabolism including insulin secretion and peripheral and hepatic insulin action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The rs7903146 was genotyped in 1) a population-based sample of 587 twins (55-64 yr) with glucose tolerance ranging from normal to type 2 diabetes and 2) a population of 196 nondiabetic young (22-31 yr) and elderly (57-66 yr) twins. All subjects underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, and population 2 was additionally examined with iv glucose tolerance tests and hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps. RESULTS: Elderly T-allele carriers had decreased plasma insulin responses and lower disposition index, whereas insulinogenic index was similar between genotype groups. Elderly nondiabetic T-allele carriers had increased peripheral insulin sensitivity (P = 0.03). Young T-allele carriers had impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity (P = 0.04) independent of plasma insulin levels. TCF7L2 gene expression in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was not explained by genotype, sex, aerobic capacity, birth, or adult anthropometry and was not associated with in vivo glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The rs7903146 T-allele associates with hepatic insulin resistance and diminished glucose-stimulated plasma insulin secretion. Our study does not provide evidence of a role of TCF7L2 gene expression in sc fat tissue and muscle tissue in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. This suggests that the primary defect of rs7903146 T-allele carriers is impairment of insulin secretion rather than a defect in insulin action in peripheral tissues.

18650481|t|TCF7L2 variants associate with CKD progression and renal function in population-based cohorts.
18650481|a|Genetic variants may increase susceptibility to both diabetes and kidney disease. Whether known diabetes-associated variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and markers of kidney function is unknown. Participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC; n = 11,061 self-identified white and n = 4014 black), Framingham Heart Offspring Cohort (FHS; n = 2468), and Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study (HAPI; n = 861) were genotyped at five (ARIC) and two (FHS) common TCF7L2 variants. The diabetes-conferring risk alleles at rs7903146 and rs7901695 were significantly associated with CKD progression among ARIC participants overall and among those without baseline diabetes. The overall adjusted hazard ratios per rs7903146 T allele were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.32) for white individuals and 1.20 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.41) for black individuals. Similarly, the overall hazard ratios per rs7901695 C allele were 1.19 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.34) for white individuals and 1.27 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.48) for black individuals. The FHS cohort supported these results: The rs7903146 T allele was significantly associated with lower estimated GFR (P = 0.01) and higher cystatin C (P = 0.004) in adjusted analyses overall and among those without diabetes. In the HAPI cohort, the rs7901695 C allele was significantly associated with lower estimated GFR in adjusted analyses (P = 0.049), as were several variants upstream and downstream of TCF7L2 (P < 0.003). No identified variant in the ARIC or FHS cohorts was associated with albuminuria. In conclusion, several population-based samples suggest that variants in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with reduced kidney function or CKD progression, overall and specifically among participants without diabetes.

18655717|t|Weak or no association of TCF7L2 variants with Type 2 diabetes risk in an Arab population.
18655717|a|BACKGROUND: The rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants of TCF7L2 have been strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in most populations studied to date. Meta-analysis of 27 different studies has resulted in a global OR of 1.46 [1.42-1.51] (rs7903146 variant). Thus far, despite a high incidence of T2D, the role of this variant in Arabs has not been established. METHODS: We performed a case-control association study using 522 Saudi T2D patients (WHO criteria), and 346 controls (age > 60; fasting plasma glucose < 7 mmol/L). Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: For rs7903146, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.415) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.405). The crude odds ratio (OR) was 1.04 with a 95% CI of 0.86-1.27 (P = 0.675). For rs12255372, the T allele frequency of the cases (0.368) was not different from that observed in the controls (0.355). Retrospective power calculations based upon an OR of 1.46 reported in a comprehensive meta-analysis of TCF7L2 risk, indicated this study was sufficiently powered (96.92%; alpha = 0.05) to detect an effect of similar magnitude to that reported for rs7903146. CONCLUSION: Our study is consistent with weak or no association of T2D in Arabs with the two TCF7L2 variants, however it cannot rule out an effect of other SNPs in this gene. Future studies in this population are required to confirm our findings and may indicate the presence of yet to be defined genetic risk factors for T2D.

18689695|t|Predicting diabetes: clinical, biological, and genetic approaches: data from the Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR).
18689695|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide a simple clinical diabetes risk score and to identify characteristics that predict later diabetes using variables available in the clinic setting as well as biological variables and polymorphisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incident diabetes was studied in 1,863 men and 1,954 women, 30-65 years of age at baseline, with diabetes defined by treatment or by fasting plasma glucose >or=7.0 mmol/l at 3-yearly examinations over 9 years. Sex-specific logistic regression equations were used to select variables for prediction. RESULTS: A total of 140 men and 63 women developed diabetes. The predictive clinical variables were waist circumference and hypertension in both sexes, smoking in men, and diabetes in the family in women. Discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating curves (AROCs), were 0.713 for men and 0.827 for women, a little higher than for the Finish Diabetes Risk (FINDRISC) score, with fewer variables in the score. Combining clinical and biological variables, the predictive equation included fasting glucose, waist circumference, smoking, and gamma-glutamyltransferase for men and fasting glucose, BMI, triglycerides, and diabetes in family for women. The number of TCF7L2 and IL6 deleterious alleles was predictive in both sexes, but after including the above clinical and biological variables, this variable was only predictive in women (P < 0.03) and the AROC statistics increased only marginally. CONCLUSIONS: The best clinical predictor of diabetes is adiposity, and baseline glucose is the best biological predictor. Clinical and biological predictors differed marginally between men and women. The genetic polymorphisms added little to the prediction of diabetes.

18694974|t|Predicting type 2 diabetes based on polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies: a population-based study.
18694974|a|OBJECTIVE: Prediction of type 2 diabetes based on genetic testing might improve identification of high-risk subjects. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified multiple new genetic variants that associate with type 2 diabetes. The predictive value of genetic testing for prediction of type 2 diabetes in the general population is unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 18 polymorphisms from recent GWA studies on type 2 diabetes in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based study among homogeneous Caucasian individuals of 55 years and older (genotyped subjects, n = 6,544; prevalent cases, n = 686; incident cases during follow-up, n = 601; mean follow-up 10.6 years). The predictive value of these polymorphisms was examined alone and in addition to clinical characteristics using logistic and Cox regression analyses. The discriminative accuracy of the prediction models was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). RESULTS: Of the 18 polymorphisms, the ADAMTS9, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B-rs1412829, FTO, IGF2BP2, JAZF1, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and WFS1 variants were associated with type 2 diabetes risk in our population. The AUC was 0.60 (95% CI 0.57-0.63) for prediction based on the genetic polymorphisms; 0.66 (0.63-0.68) for age, sex, and BMI; and 0.68 (0.66-0.71) for the genetic polymorphisms and clinical characteristics combined. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that 9 of 18 well-established genetic risk variants were associated with type 2 diabetes in a population-based study. Combining genetic variants has low predictive value for future type 2 diabetes at a population-based level. The genetic polymorphisms only marginally improved the prediction of type 2 diabetes beyond clinical characteristics.

18696049|t|The WNT signalling pathway and diabetes mellitus.
18696049|a|The WNT signalling pathway is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological activities. WNT ligands bind to Frizzled receptors and co-receptors (LDL receptor-related protein 5/6), triggering a cascade of signalling events. The major effector of the canonical WNT signalling pathway is the bipartite transcription factor beta-catenin/T cell transcription factor (beta-cat/TCF), formed by free beta-cat and one of the four TCFs. The WNT pathway is involved in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, and mutations in LRP5 may lead to the development of diabetes and obesity. beta-Cat/TCF is also involved in the production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 in the intestinal endocrine L cells. More recently, genome-wide association studies have identified TCF7L2 as a diabetes susceptibility gene, and individuals carrying certain TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms could be more susceptible to the development of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, beta-cat is able to interact with forkhead box transcription factor subgroup O (FOXO) proteins. Since FOXO and TCF proteins compete for a limited pool of beta-cat, enhanced FOXO activity during ageing and oxidative stress may attenuate WNT-mediated activities. These observations shed new light on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes as an age-dependent disease.

18702948|t|TCF7L2 gene expression in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue is differentially regulated but not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
18702948|a|Variants in the TCF7L2 gene have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the causal variant(s) is still unknown. We studied the TCF7L2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from 49 subjects using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and its relation to obesity and T2DM. All subjects were genotyped for the previously described TCF7L2 diabetes risk variants. Independent of age, sex, obesity, and diabetes status, we found >3-fold higher TCF7L2 mRNA expression in subcutaneous compared with visceral adipose tissue. There was no correlation between visceral and subcutaneous TCF7L2 expression. No differences in adipose tissue TCF7L2 mRNA expression levels were found between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, or between lean and obese subjects (all Ps > .05). In addition, there was no association between TCF7L2 genetic variants and mRNA expression. Based on our data, TCF7L2 mRNA expression is fat-depot specific but does not seem to provide the mechanistic link explaining genetic association with T2DM.

18706099|t|TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms do not predict susceptibility to diabetes in tropical calcific pancreatitis but may interact with SPINK1 and CTSB mutations in predicting diabetes.
18706099|a|BACKGROUND: Tropical calcific pancreatitis (TCP) is a type of chronic pancreatitis unique to developing countries in tropical regions and one of its important features is invariable progression to diabetes, a condition called fibro-calculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD), but the nature of diabetes in TCP is controversial. We analysed the recently reported type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene using a case-control approach, under the hypothesis that TCF7L2 variants should show similar association if diabetes in FCPD is similar to T2D. We also investigated the interaction between the TCF7L2 variants and N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations, since they are strong predictors of risk for TCP. METHODS: Two polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were analyzed by direct sequencing in 478 well-characterized TCP patients and 661 healthy controls of Dravidian and Indo-European ethnicities. Their association with TCP with diabetes (FCPD) and without diabetes was tested in both populations independently using chi-square test. Finally, a meta analysis was performed on all the cases and controls for assessing the overall significance irrespective of ethnicity. We dichotomized the whole cohort based on the presence or absence of N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations and further subdivided them into TCP and FCPD patients and compared the distribution of TCF7L2 variants between them. RESULTS: The allelic and genotypic frequencies for both TCF7L2 polymorphisms, did not differ significantly between TCP patients and controls belonging to either of the ethnic groups or taken together. No statistically significant association of the SNPs was observed with TCP or FCPD or between carriers and non-carriers of N34S SPINK1 and L26V CTSB mutations. The minor allele frequency for rs7903146 was different between TCP and FCPD patients carrying the N34S SPINK1 variant but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.93-2.70, P = 0.09), while, TCF7L2variant showed a statistically significant association between TCP and FCPD patients carrying the 26V allele (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.11-2.56, P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes associated TCF7L2 variants are not associated with diabetes in TCP. Since, TCF7L2 is a major susceptibility gene for T2D, it may be hypothesized that the diabetes in TCP patients may not be similar to T2D. Our data also suggests that co-existence of TCF7L2 variants and the SPINK1 and CTSB mutations, that predict susceptibility to exocrine damage, may interact to determine the onset of diabetes in TCP patients.

18710364|t|Dissecting the nutrigenomics, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disease interface: from risk assessment to health intervention.
18710364|a|The promise of nutrigenomics is of personalized nutrition that will lead to optimization or maintenance of good health and/or prevention of the development of chronic diseases. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading health problem throughout the world. Adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet, regulation of carbohydrate intake, and regular exercise may be desirable. Four key genes were originally identified: KCNJ11, potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 gene; PPAR-gamma, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma; TCF2, transcription factor 2, hepatic; WFS1, Wolfram syndrome 1. However, genome-wide association studies are accelerating our knowledge of the genetics of complex diseases, and have identified seven other key genes in T2DM: CDKAL1, CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein-like 1; CDKN2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; FTO, fat mass and obesity associated; HHEX, haematopoietically expressed homeobox; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; IGF2BP2, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2; SLC30A8, solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8; TCF7L2, transcription factor 7-like 2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box). Gene-nutrient or gene-environment interactions may be important. For example, the PPAR-gamma variant genotype is responsive to different types and levels of lipids, while the effect of the FTO variant can be partly overcome by exercise. Several of these genes act through their effect on the gastrointestinal tract. There are analytical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional datasets relating genes, nutrients, and other variables to their influence on health and disease processes. An even greater challenge may be in implementing population level changes in diet and behavior to fully exploit the potential of this field.

18712344|t|Association of variants of the TCF7L2 gene with increases in the risk of type 2 diabetes and the proinsulin:insulin ratio in the Spanish population.
18712344|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been related to type 2 diabetes in multiple ethnic groups. Here, we investigate whether three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with an impaired proinsulin:insulin ratio. METHODS: In this study we examined the associations between SNPs rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene and metabolic variables affecting type 2 diabetes in a population-based study of 706 unrelated individuals (47% men and 53% women; aged 35-74 years) from the province of Segovia in central Spain (Castille), including 180 individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The minor allele frequency of rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with that in non-diabetic individuals. The T (minor) allele of the variant rs7903146 was significantly associated with a greater OR for type 2 diabetes adjusted for age, sex and BMI in logistic regression analysis: OR 1.29 (95% CI 1.06-1.57, p = 0.01). This risk allele was also associated with an increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after OGTT. Similar results were obtained for the other TCF7L2 SNPs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide further evidence supporting the belief that the TCF7L2 gene is a major determinant of type 2 diabetes risk in Spain, as in other southern European populations. The association with increased proinsulin:insulin ratio after an OGTT suggests that TCF7L2 might be involved in insulin synthesis and processing.

23495871|t|The clinical utility of genetic risk variants in type 2 diabetes.
23495871|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is one of the first success stories in the application of genome-wide linkage and association studies to find genetic variants contributing to its risk. OBJECTIVE: Are the genetic markers found so far useful in predicting which individuals are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes? Can they find which patients with prediabetes are more likely to convert to type 2 diabetes and therefore may benefit the most from lifestyle or pharmacologic prevention strategies? METHODS: The literature pertaining to the discovery and replications of genes contributing to type 2 diabetes was focused on. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Substantial risk for type 2 diabetes is represented by the top 8 genes, including TCF7L2, and in certain circumstances may be useful for prevention strategies targeted to those with highest risk.

18719881|t|Beta cell glucose sensitivity is decreased by 39% in non-diabetic individuals carrying multiple diabetes-risk alleles compared with those with no risk alleles.
18719881|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Novel type 2 diabetes-susceptibility loci have been identified with evidence that individually they mediate the increased diabetes risk through altered pancreatic beta cell function. The aim of this study was to test the cumulative effects of diabetes-risk alleles on measures of beta cell function in non-diabetic individuals. METHODS: A total of 1,211 non-diabetic individuals underwent metabolic assessment including an OGTT, from which measures of beta cell function were derived. Individuals were genotyped at each of the risk loci and then classified according to the total number of risk alleles that they carried. Initial analysis focused on CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and TCF7L2 loci, which were individually associated with a decrease in beta cell function in our cohort. Risk alleles for CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2 and KCNJ11 loci were subsequently included into the analysis. RESULTS: The diabetes-risk alleles for CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and TCF7L2 showed an additive model of association with measures of beta cell function. Beta cell glucose sensitivity was decreased by 39% in those individuals with five or more risk alleles compared with those individuals with no risk alleles (geometric mean [SEM]: 84 [1.07] vs 137 [1.11] pmol min(-1) m(-2) (mmol/l)(-1), p = 1.51 x 10(-6)). The same was seen for the 30 min insulin response (p = 4.17 x 10(-7)). The relationship remained after adding in the other four susceptibility loci (30 min insulin response and beta cell glucose sensitivity, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study shows how individual type 2 diabetes-risk alleles combine in an additive manner to impact upon pancreatic beta cell function in non-diabetic individuals.

18762805|t|Evidence for an influence of TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 on insulin resistance and sensitivity indices in overweight children and adolescents during a lifestyle intervention.
18762805|a|OBJECTIVE: The T allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2 gene) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to analyze whether there is an allele-dosage effect on changes of insulin resistance and sensitivity indices in overweight children participating in a lifestyle intervention. METHODS: We genotyped rs7903146 in 236 overweight children (mean age 10.7 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 28.1 kg/m2) completing a 1-year lifestyle intervention. Degree of overweight as BMI-SDS, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the insulin sensitivity index QUICKI were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention resulted in an overweight reduction of -0.29+/-0.02 BMI-SDS. HOMA-IR (-0.63+/-0.22) and QUICKI (+0.008+/-0.003) indices improved significantly (P<0.05) in the course of the intervention in the 155 children with a decrease of BMI-SDS. There was an additive negative effect of T allele on changes of HOMA-IR (P=0.041) and QUICKI (P=0.001) in linear regression analyses adjusted to changes of weight status, age, gender and pubertal stage. CONCLUSION: Overweight children showed a negative dosage-allele effect per T allele at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in TCF7L2 concerning an improvement of insulin resistance and sensitivity after overweight reduction in a lifestyle intervention. This finding further suggests that this polymorphism might be involved in glucose metabolism.

18781959|t|Genes, environment, and interactions in prevention of type 2 diabetes: a focus on physical activity and lifestyle changes.
18781959|a|Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing public health problems worldwide. Both environmental (e.g. physical activity, obesity, and diet) and genetic factors are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. The associations between physical activity and diabetes risk have been assessed by a number of prospective studies and clinical trials. The results from these studies consistently indicate that the regular physical activity during occupation, commuting, leisure time or daily life reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes by 15-60%; and lifestyle intervention, including counselling for physical activity, nutrition, and body weight, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40-60% among adults with impaired glucose tolerance and by about 20% among general individuals. In the past decade, studies using traditional linkage analysis and candidate-gene association approach have found dozens of genes harboring common variants that were related to the common-form type 2 diabetes. However, most reported associations are lack of reproducibility, except TCF7L2, PPARG, CAPN10, and KCNJ11. Since 2007, seven genome-wide association (GWA) studies emerged to generate a list of new diabetes genes. The genetic effects are largely of moderate size. These findings provide novel insight into the diabetes etiology and pave new avenue for predicting the disease risk using genetic information. In addition, data especially those from intervention trials display preliminary but promising evidence that the genetic variants might interact with physical activity in predisposing to type 2 diabetes. The gene-environment interactions merit extensive exploration in large, prospective studies.

18806947|t|TCF7L2 expression in diabetic patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
18806947|a|INTRODUCTION: The cause of diabetes in morbidly obese patients is multifactorial, including genetic, social, and dietary components. Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a gene that is related to the development of diabetes. This pilot study examines TCF7L2 expression in liver samples obtained from morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. TCF7L2 expression is compared between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. METHODS: Liver samples were obtained from 20 morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Inc, Carlsbad, CA). Using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,CA), cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was done using SYBR Green qPCR Reagents (Stratagene, Cedar Creek TX) and the 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA). Preoperative demographic and gene expression data were correlated using univariate analysis and logistic regression models. Only associations with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: For the entire group, there was no correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TCF7L2 expression. In morbidly obese nondiabetic patients, there was a positive correlation between TCF7L2 expression and BMI (R(2)=0.21). In morbidly obese diabetic patients, there was an inverse correlation between TCF7L2 expression and BMI (R(2)=0.58). There was no significant relationship between TCF7L2 expression and age or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). CONCLUSIONS: The cause of diabetes is multifactorial but the data from our pilot study documents the relationship of TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes in morbidly obese patients.

18839133|t|Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene help to differentiate autoimmune from non-autoimmune diabetes in young (15-34 years) but not in middle-aged (40-59 years) diabetic patients.
18839133|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes in children is characterised by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells and the presence of certain risk genotypes. In adults the same situation is often referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We tested whether genetic markers associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes could help to discriminate between autoimmune and non-autoimmune diabetes in young (15-34 years) and middle-aged (40-59 years) diabetic patients. METHODS: In 1,642 young and 1,619 middle-aged patients we determined: (1) HLA-DQB1 genotypes; (2) PTPN22 and INS variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms; (3) two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7903146 and rs10885406) in the TCF7L2 gene; (4) glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and IA-2-protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein (IA-2) antibodies; and (5) fasting plasma C-peptide. RESULTS: Frequency of risk genotypes HLA-DQB1 (60% vs 25%, p = 9.4 x 10(-34); 45% vs 18%, p = 1.4 x 10(-16)), PTPN22 CT/TT (34% vs 26%, p = 0.0023; 31% vs 23%, p = 0.034), INS VNTR class I/I (69% vs 53%, p = 1.3 x 10(-8); 69% vs 51%, p = 8.5 x 10(-5)) and INS VNTR class IIIA/IIIA (75% vs 63%, p = 4.3 x 10(-6); 73% vs 60%, p = 0.008) was increased in young and middle-aged GAD antibodies (GADA)-positive compared with GADA-negative patients. The type 2 diabetes-associated genotypes of TCF7L2 CT/TT of rs7903146 were significantly more common in young GADA-negative than in GADA-positive patients (53% vs 43%; p = 0.0004). No such difference was seen in middle-aged patients, in whom the frequency of the CT/TT genotypes of TCF7L2 was similarly increased in GADA-negative and GADA-positive groups (55% vs 56%). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene help to differentiate young but not middle-aged GADA-positive and GADA-negative diabetic patients, suggesting that young GADA-negative patients have type 2 diabetes and that middle-aged GADA-positive patients are different from their young GADA-positive counterparts and share genetic features with type 2 diabetes.

18853134|t|The search for putative unifying genetic factors for components of the metabolic syndrome.
18853134|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of factors contributing to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes but unifying mechanisms have not been identified. Our aim was to study whether common variations in 17 genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes or components of the metabolic syndrome and variants in nine genes with inconsistent association with at least two components of the metabolic syndrome would also predict future development of components of the metabolic syndrome, individually or in combination. METHODS: Genetic variants were studied in a large prospective study of 16,143 non-diabetic individuals (mean follow-up time 23 years) from the Malm   Preventive Project. In this study, development of at least three of obesity (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)), dyslipidaemia (triacylglycerol >or= 1.7 mmol/l and/or lipid-lowering treatment), hypertension (blood pressure >or= 140/90 mmHg and/or antihypertensive medication) and hyperglycaemia (fasting plasma glucose >or= 5.6 mmol/l and/or known diabetes) was defined as development of the metabolic syndrome. The risk of developing at least three components of the metabolic syndrome or the individual components was calculated by logistic regression adjusted for age at baseline, follow-up time and sex. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in TCF7L2 (rs7903146, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.17, p = 0.00097), FTO (rs9939609, OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 0.0065), WFS1 (rs10010131, OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13, p = 0.0078) and IGF2BP2 (rs4402960, OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13, p = 0.021) predicted the development of at least three components of the metabolic syndrome in both univariate and multivariate analysis; in the case of TCF7L2, WFS1 and IGF2BP this was due to their association with hyperglycaemia (p < 0.00001, p = 0.0033 and p = 0.027, respectively) and for FTO it was due to its association with obesity (p = 0.004). A polymorphism in the GCKR gene predicted dyslipidaemia (rs1260326, OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.22, p < 0.00001) but not the metabolic syndrome. None of the studied polymorphisms was associated with more than two components of the metabolic syndrome. A composite genotype score of the 17 polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes predicted the development of at least three components of the metabolic syndrome (OR 1.04, p < 0.00001) and the development of hyperglycaemia (OR 1.06, p < 0.00001). Carriers of >or=19 risk alleles had 51 and 72% increased risk of developing at least three components of the metabolic syndrome and hyperglycaemia, respectively, compared with carriers of <or=12 risk alleles (p < 0.00001 for both). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Polymorphisms in susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2, WFS1, IGF2BP2) and obesity (FTO) predispose to the metabolic syndrome by increasing the risk of one specific component of the metabolic syndrome. The findings argue against a unifying genetic component for the metabolic syndrome.

18926717|t|Wnt signaling: relevance to beta-cell biology and diabetes.
18926717|a|Interest in the importance of Wnt signaling in diabetes has risen after identification of the transcription factor TCF7L2, a component of this pathway, as a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Here, we review emerging new evidence that Wnt signaling influences endocrine pancreas development and modulates mature beta-cell functions including insulin secretion, survival and proliferation. Alterations in Wnt signaling might also impact other metabolic tissues involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes, with TCF7L2 proposed to modulate adipogenesis and regulate GLP-1 production. Together, these studies point towards a role for Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of further investigation of this pathway to develop new therapies for this disease.

18931037|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism and context-specific risk of type 2 diabetes in African American and Caucasian adults: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.
18931037|a|OBJECTIVE: Although variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, large population-based studies of African Americans are lacking. Moreover, few studies have investigated the effects of TCF7L2 on type 2 diabetes in the context of metabolic risk factors of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes in 2,727 African American and 9,302 Caucasian participants without diabetes who were inducted into the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study in 1987-1989 and followed for 9 years. RESULTS: A total of 485 and 923 cases of type 2 diabetes were identified in African Americans and Caucasians, respectively. Compared with homozygous CC individuals, heterozygous CT and homozygous TT individuals had higher cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes over 9 years of follow-up: 11.3% (95% CI 10.2-12.4) vs. 21.1% (20.8-21.4) and 27.9% (19.3-36.5) in African Americans, respectively, and 9.7% (8.8-10.6) vs. 11.3% (10.2-12.4) and 13.6% (11.1-16.1), respectively, in Caucasians. Individuals with the risk allele had the highest hazards of diabetes if they were obese and had low HDL cholesterol, followed by individuals with any one and none of the traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first significant evidence of association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes risk in a large African American population and also demonstrates that the diabetes risk conveyed by the rs7903146 risk allele is substantially increased in the context of some metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Our study findings need to be replicated in other large, population-based studies.

18958766|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common reproductive endocrine disorder of premenopausal women, is strongly associated with hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given the phenotypic overlap between PCOS and T2DM, our objective was to investigate whether the TCF7L2 rs7903146(C/T) and the KCNJ11 E23K variants are involved in susceptibility to PCOS and related traits in a Greek population. A total of 183 PCOS patients and 148 healthy controls participated. All participants were Greeks. Blood was taken before hormonal therapy. PCOS patients and healthy controls were genotyped for the TCF7L2 and KCNJ11 variants. The T allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant was found to be marginally over-represented in Greek patients with PCOS. There was no association between KCNJ11 E23K polymorphism and PCOS in the present study. In addition, there were no associations observed between hormone levels and insulin resistance in PCOS carriers of TCF7L2 rs7903146 and KCNJ11 E23K variants. These data provide evidence that the rs7903146 variant of the TCF7L2 gene might influence PCOS predisposition, while no association is observed between the E23K variant of KCNJ11 and susceptibility to PCOS and related traits.

18972257|t|Comparison of genetic risk in three candidate genes (TCF7L2, PPARG, KCNJ11) with traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes in a population-based study--the HUNT study.
18972257|a|We studied the impact of genetic and traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes in a large, population-based study from Nord-Tr  ndelag county in Norway (HUNT), in both cross-sectional and prospective design. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 65,905 individuals participated in the HUNT study. We studied a randomly selected group of 869 individuals with self-reported diabetes or non-fasting serum glucose >or=11.1 mmol/L and 2,080 non-diabetic control subjects with non-fasting serum glucose <5.5 mmol/L. Four candidate polymorphisms in the three genes TCF7L2 (rs12255372 and rs7903146), PPARG (rs1801282), KCNJ11 (rs5219) and traditional risk factors were studied. RESULTS: Risk alleles of the TCF7L2 gene showed increased risk of diabetes even when controlled for traditional diabetes risk factors (diabetes in family, waist circumference, physical activity, BMI, SBP and total and HDL-cholesterol) in both a cross-sectional and prospective setting (cross-sectional: rs12255372 OR 1.61 (1.31-1.99), rs7903146 OR 1.48 (1.20-1.83) and prospective: rs12255372 OR 1.59 (1.22-2.07), rs7903146 OR 1.47 (1.11-1.93)). The risk alleles of TCF7L2 indicated impaired beta-cell function in patients and control subjects. The population attributable risks for diabetes with TCF7L2 risk alleles were 15 % and with diabetes in a first-degree relative 31 %. CONCLUSION: The risk alleles of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 and rs7903146) were strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, even after controlling for traditional risk factors in both a cross-sectional and prospective setting. These risk alleles were associated with indices of reduced beta-cell function.

18984664|t|Common type 2 diabetes risk gene variants associate with gestational diabetes.
18984664|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 11 recently identified type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes risk variants in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX/IDE, CDKN2A/2B, IGF2BP2, FTO, TCF2, PPARG, KCNJ11, and WFS1 loci were genotyped in a cohort of women with a history of GDM (n = 283) and glucose-tolerant women of the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 2446). RESULTS: All the risk alleles in the 11 examined type 2 diabetes risk variants showed an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 for the GDM group compared with the control group ranging from 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.46] to 1.44 (95% CI 1.19-1.74) except for the WFS1 rs10010131 variant with OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.73-1.05). Combined analysis of all 11 variants showed a highly significant additive effect of multiple risk alleles on risk of GDM [OR 1.18 (95% CI 1.10-1.27)] per risk allele, P = 3.2 x 10(-6)). Applying receiver-operating characteristic showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.62 for the genetic test alone and 0.73 when combining information on age, body mass index, and genotypes of the 11 gene variants. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence in a prior GDM group of several previously proven type 2 diabetes risk alleles equals the findings from association studies on type 2 diabetes. This supports the hypothesis that GDM and type 2 diabetes are two of the same entity.

18996470|t|Rapid and cost effective genotyping method for polymorphisms in PPARG, PPARGC1 and TCF7L2 genes.
18996470|a|Polymorphisms (rs1801282, rs8192678, rs7903146) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PPARGC1A) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have recently been associated with different diseases, mainly type 2 diabetes. An assay using unlabeled probes and the LightCycler or Rotor-Gene instruments was developed for genotyping of these three polymorphisms. Asymmetric polymerase chain reaction was used, followed by melting analysis of the unlabeled probe/ssDNA amplicon duplex. Samples with the target genotypes were accurately detected and easily distinguishable. Thus, genotyping using unlabeled probes is a rapid, accurate and cost effective closed-tube method. These assays demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity for the identification of selected polymorphisms in PPARG, PPARGC1A and TCF7L2 genes.

19002430|t|Type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants discovered in the recent genome-wide association studies are related to gestational diabetes mellitus in the Korean population.
19002430|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: New genetic variants associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus have been discovered in recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between these diabetogenic variants and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: The study included 869 Korean women with GDM and 345 female and 287 male Korean non-diabetic controls. We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7756992 and rs7754840 in CDKAL1; rs564398, rs1333040, rs10757278 and rs10811661 in the CDKN2A-CDKN2B region; rs8050136 in FTO; rs1111875, rs5015480 and rs7923837 in HHEX; rs4402960 in IGF2BP2; and rs13266634 in SLC30A8. In addition, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in TCF7L2; rs5215 and rs5219 in KCNJ11; and rs3856806 and rs1801282 in PPARG were genotyped. The genotype frequencies in the GDM patients were compared with those in the non-diabetic controls. RESULTS: Compared with controls (men and women combined), GDM was associated with rs7756992 and rs7754840 (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, p = 4.17 x 10(-9)) in CDKAL1; rs10811661 (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.29-1.72, p = 1.05 x 10(-7)) in the CDKN2A-CDKN2B region; rs1111875 (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.49, p = 0.003), rs5015480, and rs7923837 in HHEX; rs4402960 (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38, p = 0.03) in IGF2BP2; rs13266634 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43, p = 0.005) in SLC30A8; and rs7903146 (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.43, p = 0.038) in TCF7L2. The risk alleles of the SNPs rs7756992 and rs7754840 in CDKAL1; rs10811661 in the CDKN2A-CDKN2B region; and rs1111875, rs5015480 and rs7923837 in HHEX were associated with significant decreases in the insulin AUC during a 100 g OGTT performed at the time of diagnosis of GDM. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Some of the type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants that were discovered in the recent GWA studies are also associated with GDM in Koreans.

19012045|t|Common coding variant in the TCF7L2 gene and study of the association with type 2 diabetes in Japanese subjects.
19012045|a|Genetic variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene affect the risk of type 2 diabetes in populations with multiple ethnic groups. However, a comprehensive survey of this gene has not been done for a Japanese population. Thus, we conducted this gene-based association study, in which the common genetic variants were analyzed. Using 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects, we first screened a 9.5 kb region, which included the entire coding sequence, to assess potential functional variants of TCF7L2. Sequencing revealed a common coding variant (Pro477Thr) in exon 14 of TCF7L2 that was not enrolled in the public SNP database. Nineteen SNPs and the microsatellite DG10S478 were genotyped across the gene in 2,877 unrelated Japanese subjects. This independent screen identified the previously reported rs7903146 with a strongest association (allele P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.59 [95% confidence interval 1.25-2.01]), but there was no significant association between Pro477Thr and type 2 diabetes (allele P = 0.64). Expression of the Pro477Thr variant did not alter TCF7L2 expression in 30 lymphoblast cells. Although a genotypic effect of Pro477Thr on expression of TCF7L2 was not apparent, Pro477Thr was identified as a common variant of TCF7L2 in 2,877 Japanese subjects. Further functional studies are required to determine the possible effect of this coding variant on type 2 diabetes.

19020324|t|Clinical risk factors, DNA variants, and the development of type 2 diabetes.
19020324|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is thought to develop from an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. We examined whether clinical or genetic factors or both could predict progression to diabetes in two prospective cohorts. METHODS: We genotyped 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examined clinical factors in 16,061 Swedish and 2770 Finnish subjects. Type 2 diabetes developed in 2201 (11.7%) of these subjects during a median follow-up period of 23.5 years. We also studied the effect of genetic variants on changes in insulin secretion and action over time. RESULTS: Strong predictors of diabetes were a family history of the disease, an increased body-mass index, elevated liver-enzyme levels, current smoking status, and reduced measures of insulin secretion and action. Variants in 11 genes (TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX) were significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes independently of clinical risk factors; variants in 8 of these genes were associated with impaired beta-cell function. The addition of specific genetic information to clinical factors slightly improved the prediction of future diabetes, with a slight increase in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve from 0.74 to 0.75; however, the magnitude of the increase was significant (P=1.0x10(-4)). The discriminative power of genetic risk factors improved with an increasing duration of follow-up, whereas that of clinical risk factors decreased. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with clinical risk factors alone, common genetic variants associated with the risk of diabetes had a small effect on the ability to predict the future development of type 2 diabetes. The value of genetic factors increased with an increasing duration of follow-up.

19033397|t|Replication study of candidate genes associated with type 2 diabetes based on genome-wide screening.
19033397|a|OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to confirm possible associations between candidate genes from genome-wide association studies and type 2 diabetes in Japanese diabetic patients and a community-based general population. A total of 11 previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, and KCNJ11 genes were analyzed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Candidate SNPs were genotyped in 506 type 2 diabetic patients and 402 control subjects and meta-analyzed with six previous association studies in Japanese patients. Associations with fasting plasma insulin levels were investigated in a general population sample (n = 1,963, 61 +/- 13 years). RESULTS: In our case-control subjects, susceptibility to type 2 diabetes was replicated in TCF7L2 (rs12255372), CDKAL1 (rs7756992, rs7754840), HHEX (rs7923837), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and SLC30A8 (rs13266634). In addition to these polymorphisms, meta-analysis confirmed the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility with KCNJ11 rs5219, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and HHEX rs1111875. The TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism showed the highest odds ratio (OR) for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.714 [1.298-2.263]). Odds ratio of other polymorphisms ranged from 1.13 to 1.41. The risk allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was significantly associated with lower insulin levels in type 2 diabetic patients after adjustment for other confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes susceptibility of seven candidate genes was confirmed in Japanese. Conservation of susceptible loci for type 2 diabetes was independent of ethnic background.

19050058|t|Single nucleotide transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms in antiislet autoantibody-negative patients at onset of diabetes.
19050058|a|CONTEXT: There is controversy as to whether type 2 diabetes genetic susceptibility contributes to type 1 diabetes, and it is not known what proportion of islet autoantibody-negative new onset subjects have type 2 diabetes risk alleles. OBJECTIVES: We designed this study to evaluate whether two type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with the development of islet autoantibody-negative diabetes vs. islet autoantibody-positive diabetes in young patients and whether these SNPs are associated with specific clinical phenotypes. DESIGN: Autoantibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell antibody 512bdc (form of IA-2), insulin, ZnT8 transporter, and cytoplasmic islet cell antibody were assayed in patients with new onset diabetes seen at the Barbara Davis Center using sera obtained within 2 wk of diagnosis. We genotyped two noncoding variants in the TCF7L2 gene, rs12255372 and rs7903146, in diabetic subjects and normal controls. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients (15.7%) were negative for all islet autoantibodies among 893 subjects less than age 25 at the onset of diabetes. The allele and genotype frequencies of two SNPs showed that these are associated (odds ratio up to 4) with the development of diabetes in the autoantibody-negative diabetic cohort, but not in the autoantibody-positive diabetic cohort. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles are associated with islet autoantibody-negative but not autoantibody-positive new onset diabetes in young patients.

19053027|t|Loci of TCF7L2, HHEX and IDE on chromosome 10q and the susceptibility of their genetic polymorphisms to type 2 diabetes.
19053027|a|TCF7L2, HHEX and IDE on chromosome 10q23-25 reside within the linkage region for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies including ours have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms in these three loci are associated with T2D, respectively. But, it is unclear whether TCF7L2, independently or interactively with HHEX and IDE, confer the susceptibility to T2D. In the present study, we first replicated genetic association study of the TCF7L2 gene in a Swedish cohort including 528 non-diabetic healthy controls and 243 T2D patients and then evaluated combining effect from common risk polymorphisms in TCF7L2-HHEX-IDE loci. T2D patients were diagnosed in the intermediate study time. To avoid influence from anti-diabetic treatment, baseline data in all T2D patients were used for analysis. We found that SNPs rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were strongly associated with T2D (p<0.004). In rs7903146, T2D patients carrying genotypes CT or TT had higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (p=0.042) and lower HOMA-beta index (p=0.015) and BMI (p=0.015) compared to the patients carrying CC genotype. Furthermore, the risk alleles from TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism either with IDE rs2251101 polymorphism (p=0.0257, OR=1.398) or with HHEX rs1544210 polymorphism (p=0.0024, OR=1.514) were significantly associated with T2D. When risk alleles from three loci were combined, the association with T2D remained significant (p=0.0018, OR=1.506). The present study thus provides evidence that TCF7L2, as the main gene, together with HHEX and IDE loci have combining effects on genetic predisposition to T2D.

19055834|t|TCF7L2 variant genotypes and type 2 diabetes risk in Brazil: significant association, but not a significant tool for risk stratification in the general population.
19055834|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene are strongly associated with large increments in type 2 diabetes risk in different populations worldwide. In this study, we aimed to confirm the effect of the TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 on diabetes risk in a Brazilian population and to assess the use of this genetic marker in improving diabetes risk prediction in the general population. METHODS: We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene in 560 patients with known coronary disease enrolled in the MASS II (Medicine, Angioplasty, or Surgery Study) Trial and in 1,449 residents of Vitoria, in Southeast Brazil. The associations of this gene variant to diabetes risk and metabolic characteristics in these two different populations were analyzed. To access the potential benefit of using this marker for diabetes risk prediction in the general population we analyzed the impact of this genetic variant on a validated diabetes risk prediction tool based on clinical characteristics developed for the Brazilian general population. RESULTS: SNP rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in the MASS-II population (OR = 1.57 per T allele, p = 0.0032), confirming, in the Brazilian population, previous reports of the literature. Addition of this polymorphism to an established clinical risk prediction score did not increased model accuracy (both area under ROC curve equal to 0.776). CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele is associated with a 1.57 increased risk for type 2 diabetes in a Brazilian cohort of patients with known coronary heart disease. However, the inclusion of this polymorphism in a risk prediction tool developed for the general population resulted in no improvement of performance. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has confirmed this recent association in a South American population and adds to the great consistency of this finding in studies around the world. Finally, confirming the biological association of a genetic marker does not guarantee improvement on already established screening tools based solely on demographic variables.

19056611|t|Adiposity-related heterogeneity in patterns of type 2 diabetes susceptibility observed in genome-wide association data.
19056611|a|OBJECTIVE: This study examined how differences in the BMI distribution of type 2 diabetic case subjects affected genome-wide patterns of type 2 diabetes association and considered the implications for the etiological heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We reanalyzed data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium genome-wide association scan (1,924 case subjects, 2,938 control subjects: 393,453 single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) after stratifying case subjects (into "obese" and "nonobese") according to median BMI (30.2 kg/m(2)). Replication of signals in which alternative case-ascertainment strategies generated marked effect size heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes association signal was sought in additional samples. RESULTS: In the "obese-type 2 diabetes" scan, FTO variants had the strongest type 2 diabetes effect (rs8050136: relative risk [RR] 1.49 [95% CI 1.34-1.66], P = 1.3 x 10(-13)), with only weak evidence for TCF7L2 (rs7901695 RR 1.21 [1.09-1.35], P = 0.001). This situation was reversed in the "nonobese" scan, with FTO association undetectable (RR 1.07 [0.97-1.19], P = 0.19) and TCF7L2 predominant (RR 1.53 [1.37-1.71], P = 1.3 x 10(-14)). These patterns, confirmed by replication, generated strong combined evidence for between-stratum effect size heterogeneity (FTO: P(DIFF) = 1.4 x 10(-7); TCF7L2: P(DIFF) = 4.0 x 10(-6)). Other signals displaying evidence of effect size heterogeneity in the genome-wide analyses (on chromosomes 3, 12, 15, and 18) did not replicate. Analysis of the current list of type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants revealed nominal evidence for effect size heterogeneity for the SLC30A8 locus alone (RR(obese) 1.08 [1.01-1.15]; RR(nonobese) 1.18 [1.10-1.27]: P(DIFF) = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the impact of differences in case ascertainment on the power to detect and replicate genetic associations in genome-wide association studies. These data reinforce the notion that there is substantial etiological heterogeneity within type 2 diabetes.

19057525|a|To investigate candidate genes involved in human type 2 diabetes (T2D) for obesity-related phenotypes in pigs. Statistical association analyses of genes with fat deposition were realized in a pig reference family constructed by two breeds, Berkshire and Yorkshire. Extensive sequencing was then attempted to discover the causative polymorphism. Genes implied in human T2D development, TCF7L2, WFS1, FTO, SLC30A8, and GCKR, were mapped on Sus scrofa chromosomes 14, 8, 6, 4, and 3, respectively. Only TCF7L2 was significantly associated with five fat traits in pigs. Further investigation demonstrated that one haplotype (HapB), but not the HapA (homologous to the region for human T2D susceptibility where single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 is located), is significantly associated with the fat-related traits. In HapB, two SNPs in TCF7L2 exon 8 and intron 10 are significantly associated with five fat traits, and may be in linkage disequilibrium with the causative variant with additive effects on all four backfat traits, and the total lipid percentage. Pigs of genotype TT for the SNP in exon 8 have only one transcript isoform (the one without exon 4), and lower backfat depth. Candidate gene analyses could provide novel ideas about how these genes function in T2D susceptibility in human, and support that the pig can be a suitable model for human obesity and T2D research. Further replication of this research in other pig populations should be considered, so that the possibility of utilizing these genetic markers in pig breeding or in animal model research can be explored.

19082521|t|Association between insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants identified in genome-wide association studies.
19082521|a|Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk have been identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS). The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of these SNPs on T2DM intermediate phenotypes in order to clarify the physiological mechanisms through which they exert their effects on disease etiology. We analysed 23 SNPs in 9 T2DM genes (CDKAL1, CDKN2B, HHEX/IDE, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, TCF2, TCF7L2 and WFS1) in a maximum of 712 men and women from the Quebec Family Study. The participants underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and were measured for glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels. Indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were derived from fasting and OGTT measurements. We confirmed the significant associations of variants in CDKAL1, CDKN2B, HHEX/IDE, KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 with insulin secretion and also found associations of some of these variants with insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. IGF2BP2 and SLC30A8 SNPs were not associated with insulin secretion but were with insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (0.002 <or= P <or= 0.02). To examine the joint effects of these variants and their contribution to T2DM endophenotypes variance, stepwise regression models were used and the model R (2) was computed. The variance in the phenotypes explained by combinations of variants ranged from 2.0 to 8.5%. Diabetes-associated variants in CDKAL1, CDKN2B, HHEX/IDE, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 are associated with physiological alterations leading to T2DM, such as glucose intolerance, impaired insulin secretion or insulin resistance, supporting their role in the disease aetiology. These variants were found to account for 2.0-8.5% of the variance of T2DM-related traits.

19105201|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphism modulates glucose and lipid homeostasis, adipokine profile, and hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH.
19105201|a|Genetic factors underlying the association of NAFLD with diabetes and atherosclerosis are unknown. Recent human studies suggest transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism predisposes to diabetes through modulation of beta-cell function and modulates lipid levels in familial dyslipidemia. Emerging experimental evidence connects TCF7L2 to adipocyte metabolism and lipid homeostasis, as well. We tested if TCF7L2 polymorphism is a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and if it modulates liver injury, glucose homeostasis, lipoprotein, and adipokine profiles in NASH. TCF7L2 genotype and dietary habits of 78 nondiabetic normolipidemic NAFLD subjects and 156 age-, body mass index-, sex-matched healthy controls were assessed. In 39 biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and matched controls TCF7L2 polymorphism was correlated to liver histology and oral glucose tolerance test-derived parameters of glucose homeostasis. Patients with NASH and controls consumed a high-fat meal and TCF7L2 genotype was correlated to postprandial circulating lipoproteins, adipokines, and cytokeratin-18 fragments. The TCF7L2 CT/TT genotype was more frequent in NAFLD and predicted the presence and severity of liver disease, of beta-cell dysfunction, of reduced incretin effect and hepatic insulin resistance in NASH; it also modulated postprandial hepatocyte apoptosis, lipoproteins, and adipokine profiles in both groups. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 polymorphism predisposes to NAFLD and significantly impacts liver injury, glucose homeostasis, and postprandial lipoprotein and adipokine responses to fat ingestion. This polymorphism also modulates a fat-induced increase in circulating markers of hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH. Targeting postprandial lipemia, at least in at-risk TCF7L2 genotypes, may improve liver disease and glucose dysmetabolism in these patients.

19141695|t|Prolonged saturated fat-induced, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide elevation is associated with adipokine imbalance and liver injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: dysregulated enteroadipocyte axis as a novel feature of fatty liver.
19141695|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic and acquired mechanisms underlying the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with diabetes are unknown. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) was recently linked to adipocyte metabolism and obesity-related metabolic disorders, including NAFLD, induced by an excess of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), but its role in vivo, as well as underlying mechanisms, is unknown. We hypothesized that altered GIP secretion may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. OBJECTIVE: We assessed GIP response to SFA ingestion and its effect on glucose and lipid metabolism and on liver injury in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). DESIGN: Thirty-two nonobese, nondiabetic patients with NASH and 32 healthy controls matched for age, body mass index, and sex underwent a 7-d dietary record, an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT), and a high-fat-load test. OGTT-derived indexes of glucose homeostasis were calculated; circulating lipoproteins, total antioxidant status, GIP, adiponectin, resistin, and cytokeratin-18 fragments (markers of hepatocyte apoptosis) after a high-fat meal were assessed. All subjects were genotyped for transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism. RESULTS: Patients with NASH exhibited a prolonged GIP elevation after fat ingestion. GIP response correlated directly with hepatic steatosis, postprandial resistin, and free fatty acid (FFA) increase and inversely with beta cell function and incretin effect. Dietary polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio and TCF7L2 polymorphism independently predicted postprandial GIP response. Cytokeratin-18 fragments increased significantly postprandially in both groups but more consistently in patients with NASH; their increase was predicted by postprandial adiponectin and FFA responses. CONCLUSIONS: GIP response to SFA ingestion is prolonged in nondiabetic patients with NASH and is correlated with liver disease, an unfavorable dynamic adipokine profile, and beta cell dysfunction, which provides a rationale for GIP antagonism in these subjects.

19141698|t|Polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate the effect of TCF7L2 gene variants on postprandial lipemia.
19141698|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been recently associated with diabetes risk, and it may exert its effect through metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits and be subjected to modification by environmental factors. We investigated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs7903146 and rs12255372, within the TCF7L2 locus on postprandial lipemia and other MetS-related traits and their modulation by dietary fat. Data were collected from 1083 European Americans participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study. Carriers of the minor T allele at the C/T rs7903146 SNP had higher fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.012), lower homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function (P = 0.041), higher plasma VLDL (P = 0.035), and lower large LDL particle (P = 0.007) concentrations and higher risk of MetS (P = 0.011) than CC individuals. Moreover, we identified significant interactions between this SNP and PUFA intake modulating fasting VLDL particle concentrations (P = 0.016) and postprandial triglycerides (TG) (P = 0.028), chylomicrons (P = 0.025), total VLDL (P = 0.026), and large VLDL (P = 0.018) concentrations. Thus, only T allele carriers with a PUFA intake > or = 7.36% of energy had elevated fasting plasma VLDL concentrations and postprandial TG-rich lipoproteins. These variables did not differ in T allele carriers and noncarriers in the low-PUFA intake group. Moreover, these significant interactions were due exclusively to (n-6) PUFA intake. In summary, high (n-6) PUFA intakes (> or = 6.62% of energy intake) were associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia in carriers of the minor T allele at the TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP and may predispose them to MetS, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

19149908|t|Whole-grain consumption and transcription factor-7-like 2 ( TCF7L2) rs7903146: gene-diet interaction in modulating type 2 diabetes risk.
19149908|a|Whole grains are known to influence postprandial glucose response and insulin demand and are inversely associated with diabetes risk. Genetic variation of the transcription factor-7-like 2 encoding gene (TCF7L2) is assumed to promote an early insulin secretory defect and has been consistently attributed to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The present study examined the hypothesis that the protective effect of whole grains might be attenuated in the presence of the rs7903146 risk-conferring T-allele. We employed a case-cohort study of 2318 randomised individuals and 724 incident type 2 diabetes cases from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate relative risks of diabetes including product terms testing for the genotype-specific effect modification of dietary whole grain. Dietary intake of whole grains was assessed by a validated FFQ. The TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-allele was associated with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio=1.51; 95 % CI 1.21, 1.87) and modified the inverse association between whole-grain intake and diabetes risk (P=0.016 for interaction). While whole-grain intake was inversely associated with diabetes risk among rs7903146 CC homozygote carriers (hazard ratio for 50 g portion per d=0.86; 95 % CI 0.75, 0.99), the T-allele negated the protective effect of whole-grain intake (hazard ratio among T-allele carriers for 50 g portion per d=1.08; 95 % CI 0.96, 1.23). These data provide evidence that the beneficial effect of whole-grain intake on diabetes risk is modified by TCF7L2 rs7903146.

19156536|t|In vitro modulation of TCF7L2 gene expression in human pancreatic cells.
19156536|a|Several studies have recently reported strong association between type 2 diabetes and variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, which has been confirmed by several other genome-wide studies. However, the physiological implications of this transcription factor on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not yet known. The aim of this study was to investigate the alteration in TCF7L2 gene expression in human pancreatic cell line in response to various factors in vitro. MIA Paca-2 cell line (Human Pancreas cell line) was cultured in the presence of curcumin, lipopolysaccaride and glucose (low and high concentration). TCF7L2 gene expression was determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Treatment with curcumin significantly increased TCF7L2 gene expression to 3.24 fold (1.7-log fold) (P = 0.003) compared to the controls while treatment with LPS decreased TCF7L2 gene expression to 0.88-fold (-0.18-log). On the other hand, glucose increased TCF7L2 gene expression in pancreatic cell line. Our data suggest a role for TCF7L2 in glucose homeostasis. The contrary effect of curcumin and LPS on expression of TCF7L2 in pancreatic cells supports a role for TCF7L2 in their survival and function in inflammatory conditions.

19165345|t|Islet specific Wnt activation in human type II diabetes.
19165345|a|The Wnt pathway effector gene TCF7L2 has been linked to type II diabetes, making it important to study the role of Wnt signaling in diabetes pathogenesis. We examined the expression of multiple Wnt pathway components in pancreases from normal individuals and type II diabetic individuals. Multiple members of the Wnt signaling pathway, including TCF7L2, Wnt2b, beta-catenin, pGSK3beta, TCF3, cyclinD1, and c-myc, were undetectable or expressed at low levels in islets from nondiabetic individuals, but were also upregulated specifically in islets of type II diabetic patients. Culture of pancreatic tissue and islet isolation led to Wnt activation that was reversed by the Wnt antagonist sFRP, demonstrating that Wnt activation in that setting was due to soluble Wnt factors. These data support a model in which the Wnt pathway plays a dynamic role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes and suggest manipulation of Wnt signaling as a new approach to beta-cell-directed diabetes therapy.

19168596|t|TCF7L2 regulates late events in insulin secretion from pancreatic islet beta-cells.
19168596|a|OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms in the human TCF7L2 gene are associated with reduced insulin secretion and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms by which TCF7L2 affect insulin secretion are still unclear. We define the effects of TCF7L2 expression level on mature beta-cell function and suggest a potential mechanism for its actions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TCF7L2 expression in rodent islets and beta-cell lines was altered using RNAi or adenoviral transduction. Beta-cell gene profiles were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and the effects on intracellular signaling and exocytosis by live cell imaging, electron microscopy, and patch clamp electrophysiology. RESULTS: Reducing TCF7L2 expression levels by RNAi decreased glucose- but not KCl-induced insulin secretion. The glucose-induced increments in both ATP/ADP ratio and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were increased compared with controls. Overexpression of TCF7L2 exerted minor inhibitory effects on glucose-regulated changes in [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Gene expression profiling in TCF7L2-silenced cells revealed increased levels of mRNA encoding syntaxin 1A but decreased Munc18-1 and ZnT8 mRNA. Whereas the number of morphologically docked vesicles was unchanged by TCF7L2 suppression, secretory granule movement increased and capacitance changes decreased, indicative of defective vesicle fusion. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 is involved in maintaining expression of beta-cell genes regulating secretory granule fusion. Defective insulin exocytosis may thus underlie increased diabetes incidence in carriers of the at-risk TCF7L2 alleles.

19169495|t|Allele-specific PCR assay to genotype SNP rs7903146 in TCF7L2 gene for rapid screening of diabetes susceptibility.
19169495|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to validate a rapid and simple allele-specific PCR that genotypes TCF7/L2 rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism with standard PCR instruments. METHODS: Two forward primers with variations in their 3' nucleotides were designed in such a way that each was specific for one of the two variants. They were combined with a common reverse primer into two PCR reactions. Specific amplification indicates the presence of the allele. One hundred and four DNA samples were genotyped by this method. To evaluate the assay, the polymorphism spanning region of 63 DNA samples representing the three possible genotypes was sequenced. RESULTS: The rs7903146 allele assignments derived from the allele-specific PCR were in complete agreement with sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: The assay described here is a suitable strategy for the TCF7/L2 rs7903146 (C/T) genotyping also allowing rapid and reliable identification.

19172244|t|The risk allele load accelerates the age-dependent decline in beta cell function.
19172244|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Among the novel type 2 diabetes risk loci identified by genome-wide association studies, TCF7L2, HHEX, SLC30A8 and CDKAL1 appear to affect beta cell function. In the present study we examined the effect of these genes' risk alleles on the age-dependent decline in insulin secretion. METHODS: The SNPs rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs7754840(CDKAL1), rs7923837 (HHEX) and rs13266634 (SLC30A8) were genotyped in 1,412 non-diabetic patients, who were subsequently grouped according to their number of risk alleles. All participants underwent an OGTT. Insulin secretion was assessed by validated indices and proinsulin conversion by calculating AUC(proinsulin)/AUC(insulin). RESULTS: The number of risk alleles revealed a Gaussian distribution, with most participants carrying four risk alleles. Stratification into groups with low (LAL, up to three alleles), median (MAL, four alleles) and high (HAL, five to eight alleles) allele load resulted in MAL and HAL participants displaying significantly lower insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion than LAL participants (p <or= 0.0014 and p = 0.0185, respectively). In the overall cohort, age was negatively associated with insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion (both p < 0.0001). MAL and HAL participants showed a significantly more pronounced decline in insulin secretion with increasing age than LAL participants (p <or= 0.0325; analysis of covariance), and after stratification for BMI this relationship was maintained in obese, but not non-obese, participants. Proinsulin conversion decreased with increasing age in MAL and HAL, but not LAL, participants (p <or= 0.0003 vs p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The risk allele load significantly accelerates the age-dependent decline in beta cell function, and this might be of particular importance in obese people.

19183934|t|TCF7L2 variants are associated with increased proinsulin/insulin ratios but not obesity traits in the Framingham Heart Study.
19183934|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Common variants in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes via impaired insulin secretion. One hypothesis is that variation in TCF7L2 impairs insulin processing in the beta cell. In contrast, the association of related TCF7L2 polymorphisms with obesity is controversial in that it has only been shown in cohorts susceptible to ascertainment bias. We reproduced the association of diabetes-associated variants with proinsulin/insulin ratios, and also examined the association of a TCF7L2 haplotype with obesity in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). METHODS: We genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 (previously associated with type 2 diabetes) and rs10885406 and rs7924080 (which tag haplotype A [HapA], a haplotype reported to be associated with obesity) in 2,512 FHS participants. We used age- and sex-adjusted linear mixed-effects models to test for association with glycaemic traits, proinsulin/insulin ratios and obesity measures. RESULTS: As expected, the T risk allele of rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.01). T/T homozygotes had a 23.5% increase in the proinsulin/insulin ratio (p = 1 x 10(-7)) compared with C/C homozygotes. There was no association of HapA with BMI (p = 0.98), waist circumference (p = 0.89), subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 0.32) or visceral adipose tissue (p = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed that the risk allele of rs7903146 is associated with hyperglycaemia and a higher proinsulin/insulin ratio. We did not detect any association of the TCF7L2 HapA with adiposity measures, suggesting that this may have been a spurious association from ascertainment bias, possibly induced by the evaluation of obesity in separate groups of glycaemic cases and controls.

19184112|t|Identification of susceptibility genes for complex diseases using pooling-based genome-wide association scans.
19184112|a|The success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify risk loci of complex diseases is now well-established. One persistent major hurdle is the cost of those studies, which make them beyond the reach of most research groups. Performing GWAS on pools of DNA samples may be an effective strategy to reduce the costs of these studies. In this study, we performed pooling-based GWAS with more than 550,000 SNPs in two case-control cohorts consisting of patients with Type II diabetes (T2DM) and with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). In the T2DM study, the results of the pooling experiment were compared to individual genotypes obtained from a previously published GWAS. TCF7L2 and HHEX SNPs associated with T2DM by the traditional GWAS were among the top ranked SNPs in the pooling experiment. This dataset was also used to refine the best strategy to correctly identify SNPs that will remain significant based on individual genotyping. In the CRS study, the top hits from the pooling-based GWAS located within ten kilobases of known genes were validated by individual genotyping of 1,536 SNPs. Forty-one percent (598 out of the 1,457 SNPs that passed quality control) were associated with CRS at a nominal P value of 0.05, confirming the potential of pooling-based GWAS to identify SNPs that differ in allele frequencies between two groups of subjects. Overall, our results demonstrate that a pooling experiment on high-density genotyping arrays can accurately determine the minor allelic frequency as compared to individual genotyping and produce a list of top ranked SNPs that captures genuine allelic differences between a group of cases and controls. The low cost associated with a pooling-based GWAS clearly justifies its use in screening for genetic determinants of complex diseases.

19203201|t|Risk loci for type 2 diabetes - quo vadis?
19203201|a|Reduced insulin sensitivity plays a role in the early pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, and defects in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells are instrumental in hyperglycemic progression. There is strong evidence that genetic factors play an important role in both of these components. Several of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes are hypothesized to influence beta-cell function. The aim of the present study was to describe the function of the latter genes, to analyze the implications of the SNP positions within or near these genes, and to evaluate the suggested primary role of pancreatic beta-cells in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.

19211816|t|TCF7L2, dietary carbohydrate, and risk of type 2 diabetes in US women.
19211816|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 is the strongest type 2 diabetes (T2D) locus identified to date, and evidence suggests it plays an important role in insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion. Dietary factors that increase the insulin demand might enhance the risk of T2D associated with TCF7L2 variants. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the risk of T2D associated with TCF7L2 is modified by the glycemic load (GL), glycemic index (GI), cereal fiber content, and total carbohydrate content of the diet. DESIGN: T2D cases (n = 1140) and controls (n = 1915) from the Nurses' Health Study were genotyped for TCF7L2 (rs12255372). Dietary intake was assessed with a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Significant differences in odds ratios (ORs) of T2D associated with the TCF7L2 genotype between high and low strata of GL (P = 0.03) and GI (P = 0.05) were suggested. Compared with the GG genotype, multivariate-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of T2D associated with the TT genotype were 2.71 (1.64, 4.46) and 2.69 (1.64, 4.43) among individuals in the highest tertile of GL and GI, respectively. Corresponding ORs (95% CIs) among individuals in the lowest tertiles of GL and GI were 1.66 (0.95, 2.88) and 1.82 (1.11, 3.01). The risk of T2D associated with the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism did not significantly differ by cereal fiber or carbohydrate intake. CONCLUSION: Carbohydrate quality and quantity modified risk of T2D associated with TCF7L2, which suggests that changes in risk attributable to the TCF7L2 variant are magnified under conditions of increased insulin demand.

19214925|t|Wnt-signalling and the metabolic syndrome.
19214925|a|The Wnt-signalling pathway plays a well-established role in embryogenesis and tumourigenesis. However, recent data puts Wnt-signalling in the context of metabolic disease. In vitro and in vivo data characterised the role of Wnt-signalling molecules in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). Furthermore, Wnts play a pivotal role in regulating pancreatic beta-cell function and mass. In addition, studies found polymorphisms within the gene encoding TCF7L2, a Wnt-regulated transcription factor, to contribute an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans. This review will summarise recent aspects of Wnt-signalling in these pathophysiologic events and discuss the contributions of dysregulation in Wnt-signalling to features of the metabolic syndrome.

19225753|t|Interaction between prenatal growth and high-risk genotypes in the development of type 2 diabetes.
19225753|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Early environmental factors and genetic variants have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an interaction between birthweight and common variants in the TCF7L2, HHEX, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 2,003 participants from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, 311 of whom were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by an OGTT, were genotyped for the specified variants. Indices for insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated. RESULTS: Low birthweight was associated with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.008) and impaired insulin secretion (p = 0.04). Of the tested variants, the risk variant in HHEX showed a trend towards a low birthweight (p = 0.09) and the risk variant in the CDKN2A/2B locus was associated with high birthweight (p = 0.01). The TCF7L2 risk allele was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Pooling across all nine genes, each risk allele increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 14%. [corrected] Risk variants in the HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes interacted with birthweight, so that the risk of type 2 diabetes was highest in those with lower birthweight (p <or= 0.05). The interaction was also present in the pooled data. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low birthweight might affect the strength of the association of some common variants (HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1) with type 2 diabetes. These findings need to be replicated in independent cohorts.

19228405|t|Association between TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus: a large Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) review and meta-analysis.
19228405|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2MD) in multiple ethnic groups in the past two years, but, contradictory results were reported for Chinese and Pima Indian populations. The authors then performed a large meta-analysis of 36 studies examining the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene in various ethnicities, containing rs7903146 C-to-T (IVS3C>T), rs7901695 T-to-C (IVS3T>C), a rs12255372 G-to-T (IVS4G>T), and rs11196205 G-to-C (IVS4G>C) polymorphisms and to evaluate the size of gene effect and the possible genetic mode of action. METHODS: Literature-based searching was conducted to collect data and three methods, that is, fixed-effects, random-effects and Bayesian multivariate mete-analysis, were performed to pool the odds ratio (OR). Publication bias and study-between heterogeneity were also examined. RESULTS: The studies included 35,843 cases of T2DM and 39,123 controls, using mainly primary data. For T2DM and IVS3C>T polymorphism, the Bayesian OR for TT homozygotes and TC heterozygotes versus CC homozygote was 1.968 (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.790, 2.157), 1.406 (95% CrI: 1.341, 1.476), respectively, and the population attributable risk (PAR) for the TT/TC genotypes of this variant is 16.9% for overall. For T2DM and IVS4G>T polymorphism, TT homozygotes and TG heterozygotes versus GG homozygote was 1.885 (95%CrI: 1.698, 2.088), 1.360 (95% CrI: 1.291, 1.433), respectively. Four ORs among these two polymorphisms all yielded significant between-study heterogeneity (P < 0.05) and the main source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences. Data also showed significant associations between T2DM and the other two polymorphisms, but with low heterogeneity (P > 0.10). Pooled ORs fit a codominant, multiplicative genetic model for all the four polymorphisms of TCF7L2 gene, and this model was also confirmed in different ethnic populations when stratification of IVS3C>T and IVS4G>T polymorphisms except for Africans, where a dominant, additive genetic mode is suggested for IVS3C>T polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that four variants of TCF7L2 gene are all associated with T2DM, and indicates a multiplicative genetic model for all the four polymorphisms, as well as suggests the TCF7L2 gene involved in near 1/5 of all T2MD. Potential gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions by which common variants in the TCF7L2 gene influence the risk of T2MD need further exploration.

19247372|t|Construction of a prediction model for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Japanese population based on 11 genes with strong evidence of the association.
19247372|a|Prediction of the disease status is one of the most important objectives of genetic studies. To select the genes with strong evidence of the association with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we validated the associations of the seven candidate loci extracted in our earlier study by genotyping the samples in two independent sample panels. However, except for KCNQ1, the association of none of the remaining seven loci was replicated. We then selected 11 genes, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, HHEX, GCKR, HNF1B, KCNJ11 and PPARG, whose associations with diabetes have already been reported and replicated either in the literature or in this study in the Japanese population. As no evidence of the gene-gene interaction for any pair of the 11 loci was shown, we constructed a prediction model for the disease using the logistic regression analysis by incorporating the number of the risk alleles for the 11 genes, as well as age, sex and body mass index as independent variables. Cumulative risk assessment showed that the addition of one risk allele resulted in an average increase in the odds for the disease of 1.29 (95% CI=1.25-1.33, P=5.4 x 10(-53)). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, an estimate of the power of the prediction model, was 0.72, thereby indicating that our prediction model for type 2 diabetes may not be so useful but has some value. Incorporation of data from additional risk loci is most likely to increase the predictive power.

19247628|t|Unique splicing pattern of the TCF7L2 gene in human pancreatic islets.
19247628|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intronic variation in the TCF7L2 gene exhibits the strongest association to type 2 diabetes observed to date, but the mechanism whereby this genetic variation translates into altered biological function is largely unknown. A possible explanation is a genotype-dependent difference in the complex splicing pattern; however, this has not previously been characterised in pancreatic or insulin target tissues. Here, the detailed TCF7L2 splicing pattern in five human tissues is described and dependence on risk genotype explored. METHODS: RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were employed to characterise TCF7L2 splicing in pancreatic islets, blood lymphocytes, skeletal muscle and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: The mapping of TCF7L2 splice variants shows a specific pattern in pancreatic islets, with four predominant transcripts and high usage of the variable exons 4 and 15. The overall concentration of TCF7L2 mRNA is highest in islets and fat and lower in blood and muscle. No significant difference in overall amount or splicing pattern was observed between carriers and non-carriers of the rs7903146 risk (T) allele. However, incorporation of exon 4 in islets correlates positively with plasma HbA(1c) levels (r = 0.758; p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: There were pronounced tissue-specific differences in the splicing of TCF7L2 with forms containing exon 4 and 15 being most abundant in islets. The incorporation of exon 4 in islets correlated with HbA(1c) levels. Further experiments will be needed to determine the direction of this correlation, and larger cohorts needed to unequivocally resolve whether there is a relationship between genotype and splicing in islets.

19251050|t|Role of Wnt signaling in the development of type 2 diabetes.
19251050|a|Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, insulin deficiency, and hyperglycemia. Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes has been linked to Wnt signaling, which plays an important role in intestinal tumorigenesis. Carriers of variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene, an important component of the Wnt pathway, are at enhanced risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The modulation of proglucagon expression by Wnt activity may partially explain the link between Wnt signaling and diabetes, and one of the transcriptional and processing products of the proglucagon gene, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), exhibits a wide variety of antidiabetogenic activities. GLP-1 stimulates Wnt signaling in pancreatic beta cells, enhancing cell proliferation; thus, positive feedback between GLP-1 and Wnt signaling may result in increased proliferation, and suppressed apoptosis, of pancreatic cells. Since beta-cell protection is a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes, stimulation of Wnt activity may represent a valid therapeutic approach.

19252133|t|Interrogating type 2 diabetes genome-wide association data using a biological pathway-based approach.
19252133|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have resulted in a dramatic increase in our knowledge of the genetic loci involved in type 2 diabetes. In a complementary approach to these single-marker studies, we attempted to identify biological pathways associated with type 2 diabetes. This approach could allow us to identify additional risk loci. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used individual level genotype data generated from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) type 2 diabetes study, consisting of 393,143 autosomal SNPs, genotyped across 1,924 case subjects and 2,938 control subjects. We sought additional evidence from summary level data available from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) studies. Statistical analysis of pathways was performed using a modification of the Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm (GSEA). A total of 439 pathways were analyzed from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, and BioCarta databases. RESULTS: After correcting for the number of pathways tested, we found no strong evidence for any pathway showing association with type 2 diabetes (top P(adj) = 0.31). The candidate WNT-signaling pathway ranked top (nominal P = 0.0007, excluding TCF7L2; P = 0.002), containing a number of promising single gene associations. These include CCND2 (rs11833537; P = 0.003), SMAD3 (rs7178347; P = 0.0006), and PRICKLE1 (rs1796390; P = 0.001), all expressed in the pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: Common variants involved in type 2 diabetes risk are likely to occur in or near genes in multiple pathways. Pathway-based approaches to genome-wide association data may be more successful for some complex traits than others, depending on the nature of the underlying disease physiology.

19258404|t|The inhibitory effect of recent type 2 diabetes risk loci on insulin secretion is modulated by insulin sensitivity.
19258404|a|CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: Recently novel type 2 diabetes risk loci were identified and reported to associate with beta-cell dysfunction. We assessed whether the risk alleles in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKN2A/2B, JAZF1, and WFS1 reduce insulin secretion in an additive manner and whether their impact is influenced by insulin sensitivity. DESIGN/METHODS: We genotyped 1397 nondiabetic subjects for the aforementioned risk alleles and performed risk allele summation. Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test and in a subgroup also an iv glucose tolerance test with C-peptide and insulin measurements. In our cohort, only polymorphisms in SLC30A8, HHEX, TCF7L2, and CDKAL1 influenced insulin secretion. So we tested only these polymorphisms and, in a separate analysis, all above-mentioned polymorphisms. RESULTS: We observed a 28% decline in insulin secretion with increment of risk alleles (P <or= 0.0018). Subjects with two to four risk alleles displayed a progressive decline in ss-cell function, which was not further enhanced in carriers of five to seven alleles. After stratification for insulin sensitivity, subjects with low insulin sensitivity revealed a significant decline in insulin secretion with increment of risk alleles (P = 0.0086), whereas this was not seen in subjects with high insulin sensitivity (P = 0.07). The additional study with eight risk alleles provided similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The negative effects of the risk alleles on ss-cell function appear additive in subjects with low insulin sensitivity but not in subjects with high insulin sensitivity. Effective compensatory mechanisms may exist in subjects with high insulin sensitivity that limit the impact of these genes.

19258437|t|Genetic variant in the IGF2BP2 gene may interact with fetal malnutrition to affect glucose metabolism.
19258437|a|OBJECTIVE: Fetal malnutrition may predispose to type 2 diabetes through gene programming and developmental changes. Previous studies showed that these effects may be modulated by genetic variation. Genome-wide association studies discovered and replicated a number of type 2 diabetes-associated genes. We investigated the effects of such well-studied polymorphisms and their interactions with fetal malnutrition on type 2 diabetes risk and related phenotypes in the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The rs7754840 (CDKAL1), rs10811661 (CDKN2AB), rs1111875 (HHEX), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs5219 (KCNJ11), rs13266634 (SLC30A8), and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms were genotyped in 772 participants of the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study (n = 328 exposed, n = 444 unexposed). Logistic and linear regression models served to analyze their interactions with prenatal exposure to famine on type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and area under the curves (AUCs) for glucose and insulin during oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). RESULTS: In the total population, the TCF7L2 and IGF2BP2 variants most strongly associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes/IGT and increased AUC for glucose, while the CDKAL1 polymorphism associated with decreased AUC for insulin. The IGF2BP2 polymorphism showed an interaction with prenatal exposure to famine on AUC for glucose (beta = -9.2 [95% CI -16.2 to -2.1], P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The IGF2BP2 variant showed a nominal interaction with exposure to famine in utero, decreasing OGTT AUCs for glucose. This may provide a clue that modulation of the consequences of fetal environment depends on an individual's genetic background.

19273354|t|Pharmacogenetics and future strategies in treating hyperglycaemia in diabetes.
19273354|a|This review focuses on current evidence for pharmacogenetics for the 3 commonly used drug classes in treating diabetes: metformin, sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Currently, metformin pharmacogenetics is focussing on drug transport with the recent finding that variation in OCT transporters might affect metformin response. An aetiological approach has identified monogenic patients with diabetes due to TCF1 mutations who are particularly sensitive to the hypoglycaemic effects of sulphonylureas, and KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations in which sulphonylureas can be used in place of insulin treatment. In Type 2 diabetes sulphonylurea response has been shown to be associated with variants TCF7L2 associated with type 2 diabetes risk. For thiazolidinediones, focus has been on PPARgamma variants although with no consistent result. Genome wide association studies offer great potential to unravel what genetic factors influence response and side effects of diabetes therapies. Large numbers of well phenotyped patients for response and side effect as well as similarly sized similarly phenotyped replication cohorts are required. Establishing such cohorts is a priority in diabetes pharmacogenetics research.

19286335|t|TCF7L2 is associated with type 2 diabetes in nonobese individuals from Tunisia.
19286335|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 T allele was associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in most populations worldwide. In individuals of European descent, the association with T2D was recently found to be modulated by obesity status. However, further studies are necessary to clarify if whether interaction exists among subjects of non-European descent. In the present study, we analyzed the association of rs7903146 with T2D in 90 nonobese (Body Mass Index [BMI] <25kg/m(2)), 171 overweight (25 <=BMI<30kg/m(2)) et 98 obese (BMI>= 30kg/m(2)) individuals from Tunisia. The T allele was nominally associated with T2D in nonobese subjects (Odds Ratio [OR]=3.24 [1.10-9.53], P=0.021) whereas no effect was detected in overweight (P=0.3) and obese (P=0.22) individuals. Consequently, the same risk allele decreased susceptibility to obesity in T2D subjects (OR=0.47 [0.23-0.94], P=0.029) but not in normoglycemic controls (P=0.44). When analyzed all together, no allelic association was observed with T2D (P=0.20) whereas an artefactual association with decreased obesity (0.59 [0.38-0.90], P=0.013) was detected. As in Europeans, TCF7L2 is therefore not a risk factor for obesity in Tunisians, but its effect on T2D risk is modulated by obesity. In conclusion, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele is nominally associated with T2D susceptibility in nonobese individuals from Tunisia.

19288077|t|The T allele of rs7903146 TCF7L2 is associated with impaired insulinotropic action of incretin hormones, reduced 24 h profiles of plasma insulin and glucagon, and increased hepatic glucose production in young healthy men.
19288077|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We studied the physiological, metabolic and hormonal mechanisms underlying the elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in carriers of TCF7L2 gene. METHODS: We undertook genotyping of 81 healthy young Danish men for rs7903146 of TCF7L2 and carried out various beta cell tests including: 24 h glucose, insulin and glucagon profiles; OGTT; mixed meal test; IVGTT; hyperglycaemic clamp with co-infusion of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP); and a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp combined with glucose tracer infusion to study hepatic and peripheral insulin action. RESULTS: Carriers of the T allele were characterised by reduced 24 h insulin concentrations (p < 0.05) and reduced insulin secretion relative to glucose during a mixed meal test (beta index: p < 0.003), but not during an IVGTT. This was further supported by reduced late-phase insulinotropic action of GLP-1 (p = 0.03) and GIP (p = 0.07) during a 7 mmol/l hyperglycaemic clamp. Secretion of GLP-1 and GIP during the mixed meal test was normal. Despite elevated hepatic glucose production, carriers of the T allele had significantly reduced 24 h glucagon concentrations (p < 0.02) suggesting altered alpha cell function. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Elevated hepatic glucose production and reduced insulinotropic effect of incretin hormones contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in carriers of the rs7903146 risk T allele of TCF7L2.

19323963|t|Pharmacogenetics in diabetes.
19323963|a|Genetic variation can impact on efficacy and risk of adverse events to commonly used oral agents in -diabetes. Metformin is not metabolized and its mechanism of action remains debated; however, several cation transporters have been identified. Variation in these pharmacokinetic genes might influence metformin response. Conversely, although the cytochrome P450 system has been implicated in sulfonylurea response in some small studies, to date variants affecting pharmacodynamics, including those in ABCC8 (SUR1) and TCF7L2, are the most promising. For thiazolidinedione response, variants in PPARG or ADIPOQ (adiponectin) have been variably associated with response. With increasing well-phenotyped cohorts and new methods, including genome-wide association studies, the next few years offer great hope to use pharmacogenetics to unravel drug and disease mechanisms, as well as the possibility to individualize therapy by genotype.

19351735|t|Evidence for association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and TCF7L2 and glucose intolerance in women with PCOS and TCF7L2.
19351735|a|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Of the recently identified type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) susceptibility loci, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) confers the greatest relative risk for T2D and significantly predicts conversion to T2D in persons with impaired glucose tolerance. TCF7L2 is, therefore, also a strong candidate gene for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder characterized by androgen excess and menstrual irregularities and associated with insulin resistance and a 7-fold increased risk for T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested for association between 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to TCF7L2 and PCOS in 624 index (PCOS) cases and 553 control women of European ancestry. Furthermore, in the women with PCOS, we tested for association with seven reproductive and metabolic quantitative traits. RESULTS: Although we did not detect evidence for association between the previously described TCF7L2 T2D locus, the proinsulin:insulin molar ratio, a marker of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, was strongly associated with this locus (P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). We also observed evidence for association between PCOS and two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs11196236 (P = 9.0 x 10(-4)) and rs11196229 (P = 0.0027) mapping more than 100 kb centromeric to the previously published T2D susceptibility loci. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed evidence of association with two independent TCF7L2 loci in a PCOS cohort: 1) association between the proinsulin:insulin molar ratio and the T2D locus; and 2) association with reproductive PCOS phenotype and a novel locus. This study suggests that variation in different regions of a susceptibility gene contributes to distinct phenotypes.

19368707|t|Contribution of type 2 diabetes associated loci in the Arabic population from Tunisia: a case-control study.
19368707|a|BACKGROUND: Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have both reproducibly identified several common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that confer type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in European populations. Our aim was to evaluate the contribution to T2D of five of these established T2D-associated loci in the Arabic population from Tunisia. METHODS: A case-control design comprising 884 type 2 diabetic patients and 513 control subjects living in the East-Center of Tunisia was used to analyze the contribution to T2D of the following SNPs: E23K in KCNJ11/Kir6.2, K121Q in ENPP1, the -30G/A variant in the pancreatic beta-cell specific promoter of Glucokinase, rs7903146 in TCF7L2 encoding transcription factor 7-like2, and rs7923837 in HHEX encoding the homeobox, hematopoietically expressed transcription factor. RESULTS: TCF7L2-rs7903146 T allele increased susceptibility to T2D (OR = 1.25 [1.06-1.47], P = 0.006) in our study population. This risk was 56% higher among subjects carrying the TT genotype in comparison to those carrying the CC genotype (OR = 1.56 [1.13-2.16], P = 0.002). No allelic or genotypic association with T2D was detected for the other studied polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: In the Tunisian population, TCF7L2-rs7903146 T allele confers an increased risk of developing T2D as previously reported in the European population and many other ethnic groups. In contrast, none of the other tested SNPs that influence T2D risk in the European population was associated with T2D in the Tunisian Arabic population. An insufficient power to detect minor allelic contributions or genetic heterogeneity of T2D between different ethnic groups can explain these findings.

19386626|t|Decreased TCF7L2 protein levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus correlate with downregulation of GIP- and GLP-1 receptors and impaired beta-cell function.
19386626|a|Recent human genetics studies have revealed that common variants of the TCF7L2 (T-cell factor 7-like 2, formerly known as TCF4) gene are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have shown that TCF7L2 expression in the beta-cells is correlated with function and survival of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cell. In order to understand how variations in TCF7L2 influence diabetes progression, we investigated its mechanism of action in the beta-cell. We show robust differences in TCF7L2 expression between healthy controls and models of T2DM. While mRNA levels were approximately 2-fold increased in isolated islets from the diabetic db/db mouse, the Vancouver Diabetic Fatty (VDF) Zucker rat and the high fat/high sucrose diet-treated mouse compared with the non-diabetic controls, protein levels were decreased. A similar decrease was observed in pancreatic sections from patients with T2DM. In parallel, expression of the receptors for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP-R) was decreased in islets from humans with T2DM as well as in isolated human islets treated with siRNA to TCF7L2 (siTCF7L2). Also, insulin secretion stimulated by glucose, GLP-1 and GIP, but not KCl or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was impaired in siTCF7L2-treated isolated human islets. Loss of TCF7L2 resulted in decreased GLP-1 and GIP-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, and AKT-mediated Foxo-1 phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. Our findings suggest that beta-cell function and survival are regulated through an interplay between TCF7L2 and GLP-1R/GIP-R expression and signaling in T2DM.

19401414|t|Confirmation of multiple risk Loci and genetic impacts by a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.
19401414|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify novel type 2 diabetes gene variants and confirm previously identified ones, a three-staged genome-wide association study was performed in the Japanese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the stage 1 scan, we genotyped 519 case and 503 control subjects with 482,625 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers; in the stage 2 panel comprising 1,110 case subjects and 1,014 control subjects, we assessed 1,456 SNPs (P < 0.0025, stage 1); additionally to direct genotyping, 964 healthy control subjects formed the in silico control panel. Along with genome-wide exploration, we aimed to replicate the disease association of 17 SNPs from 16 candidate loci previously identified in Europeans. The associated and/or replicated loci (23 SNPs; P < 7 x 10(-5) for genome-wide exploration and P < 0.05 for replication) were examined in the stage 3 panel comprising 4,000 case subjects and 12,569 population-based samples, from which 4,889 nondiabetic control subjects were preselected. The 12,569 subjects were used for overall risk assessment in the general population. RESULTS: Four loci-1 novel with suggestive evidence (PEPD on 19q13, P = 1.4 x 10(-5)) and three previously reported-were identified; the association of CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and KCNQ1 were confirmed (P < 10(-19)). Moreover, significant associations were replicated in five other candidate loci: TCF7L2, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, HHEX, and KCNJ11. There was substantial overlap of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes between the two populations, whereas effect size and explained variance tended to be higher in the Japanese population. CONCLUSIONS: The strength of association was more prominent in the Japanese population than in Europeans for more than half of the confirmed type 2 diabetes loci.

19455305|t|No association of multiple type 2 diabetes loci with type 1 diabetes.
19455305|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We used recently confirmed type 2 diabetes gene regions to investigate the genetic relationship between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, in an average of 7,606 type 1 diabetic individuals and 8,218 controls, providing >80% power to detect effects as small as an OR of 1.11 at a false-positive rate of 0.003. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the most convincing evidence of association in 12 type 2 diabetes-associated gene regions, PPARG, CDKAL1, HNF1B, WFS1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A-CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, FTO, HHEX-IDE and THADA, were analysed in type 1 diabetes cases and controls. PPARG and HHEX-IDE were additionally tested for association in 3,851 type 1 diabetes families. Tests for interaction with HLA class II genotypes, autoantibody status, sex, and age-at-diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were performed with all 12 gene regions. RESULTS: Only PPARG and HHEX-IDE showed any evidence of association with type 1 diabetes cases and controls (p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, respectively; p > 0.05 for other SNPs). The potential association of PPARG was supported by family analyses (p = 0.003; p (combined) = 1.0 x 10(-4)). No SNPs showed evidence of interaction with any covariate (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found no convincing genetic link between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. An association of PPARG (rs1801282/Pro12Ala) could be consistent with its known function in inflammation. Hence, our results reinforce evidence suggesting that type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, rather than being due to inherited defects in beta cell function or regeneration or insulin resistance.

19473183|t|Interactions between TCF7L2 genotype and growth hormone-induced changes in glucose homeostasis in small for gestational age children.
19473183|a|CONTEXT: The Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 gene polymorphism has been associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly by decreasing insulin secretion. Small for gestational age (SGA) birth has been associated with type 2 DM in later life. Growth hormone (GH) treatment reduces insulin sensitivity and increases insulin secretion. Therefore, GH-treated SGA children are an ideal group to investigate whether the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype is associated with changes in glucose homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism on changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity during 4 years of GH treatment in children born SGA. SUBJECTS: A total of 246 Caucasian short children born SGA, with a median age of 7.8 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) (n = 68) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculations (all). RESULTS: There was no association between rs7903146 genotype and insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion at baseline but after adjustment for possible confounders, insulin secretion was higher in the CT/TT group than in the CC group. During GH treatment, carriers of the rs7903146 T allele had an increase in insulin secretion similar to that of carriers of the CC genotype. The decrease in insulin sensitivity was only significant in the CT/TT group, but the difference in decrease between genotype groups did not reach significance (P = 0.06). The disposition index (insulin secretion x insulin sensitivity), which is an estimate of beta cell function, was not associated with genotype and did not change during GH treatment. CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is not associated with the change in insulin secretion during GH treatment in short SGA children.

19482368|t|Meta-analysis of the association between SNPs in TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes in East Asian population.
19482368|a|AIMS: To evaluate the effect of TCF7L2 on genetic susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in East Asian population by using the meta-analysis. METHODS: Search all the publications about the association between TCF7L2 and T2DM in East Asian population from PubMed, CNKI and abstracts of major diabetes conferences. Perform the meta-analysis of all the validated studies and evaluate the association between rs7903146 T allele, rs12255372 T allele, rs11196205 C allele, rs290487 C allele and rs11196218 G allele of TCF7L2 and the risk of T2DM. RESULTS: Eleven studies from nine eligible papers and one unpublished study of ours were included in the meta-analysis. Ten eligible studies were analyzed for rs7903146, five were analyzed for rs12255372 and rs11196205, and three were analyzed for rs290487 and rs11196218. We found that four SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs290487) in TCF7L2 were significantly associated with T2DM in East Asian populations. The rs11196218 also showed a marginal association. The estimated population-attributable risk (PAR) associated with analyzed SNPs ranged from 2% to 7%. CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in TCF7L2 were strongly associated with the risk of T2DM in East Asian population. But the contribution of its genetic variants to the epidemic of type 2 diabetes in East Asian was relatively low.

19482541|t|Emerging therapies for metabolic diseases--the focus is on diabetes and obesity.
19482541|a|Type 2 diabetes and obesity remain the focus of investigational drugs for metabolic disease. Only one new class of agents (Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 Inhibitors) has been approved in this field for control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. Significant progress has been made in the elucidation of pathways of interest for new therapies in diabetes and obesity, partly through advances in human genetics that have highlighted genetic loci relevant to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and hypothalamic control of food intake, respectively. Investigational drugs targeting these pathways are in early clinical investigation, including GPR119 agonists. Compounds targeting lipid partitioning and lipid biosynthetic enzymes also have emerged, including inhibitors of the enzymes DGAT1 and SCD1.

19502414|t|Association of 18 confirmed susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes with indices of insulin release, proinsulin conversion, and insulin sensitivity in 5,327 nondiabetic Finnish men.
19502414|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of 18 confirmed type 2 diabetes risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and conversion of proinsulin to insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 5,327 nondiabetic men (age 58 +/- 7 years, BMI 27.0 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)) from a large population-based cohort were included. Oral glucose tolerance tests and genotyping of SNPs in or near PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, LOC387761, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, HNF1B, WFS1, JAZF1, CDC123, TSPAN8, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B were performed. HNF1B rs757210 was excluded because of failure to achieve Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. RESULTS: Six SNPs (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2B, CDKAL1, and MTNR1B) were significantly (P < 6.9 x 10(-4)) and two SNPs (KCNJ11 and IGF2BP2) were nominally (P < 0.05) associated with early-phase insulin release (InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30)), adjusted for age, BMI, and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda ISI). Combined effects of these eight SNPs reached -32% reduction in InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30) in carriers of >or=11 vs. <or=3 weighted risk alleles. Four SNPs (SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, and TCF7L2) were significantly or nominally associated with indexes of proinsulin conversion. Three SNPs (KCNJ11, HHEX, and TSPAN8) were nominally associated with Matsuda ISI (adjusted for age and BMI). The effect of HHEX on Matsuda ISI became significant after additional adjustment for InsAUC(0-30)/GluAUC(0-30). Nine SNPs did not show any associations with examined traits. CONCLUSIONS: Eight type 2 diabetes-related loci were significantly or nominally associated with impaired early-phase insulin release. Effects of SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, and TCF7L2 on insulin release could be partially explained by impaired proinsulin conversion. HHEX might influence both insulin release and insulin sensitivity.

19506043|t|Association and interaction analyses of genetic variants in ADIPOQ, ENPP1, GHSR, PPARgamma and TCF7L2 genes for diabetic nephropathy in a Taiwanese population with type 2 diabetes.
19506043|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes. In this study, we aimed to explore both primary effects of single-locus and multilocus interactions to test the hypothesis that the type 2 diabetes (T2D) genes may contribute to the aetiology of DN in T2D independently and/or through complex interactions in a Taiwanese population with T2D. METHODS: We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for five common T2D genes including adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing (ADIPOQ), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2). There were 216 T2D patients diagnosed with DN and 178 age-similar T2D without DN (control) subjects. To investigate gene-gene interactions, we employed both generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Single-locus analyses showed significant main effects of ENPP1 (P = 0.0032; adjusted OR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.17-2.92) on the risk of DN in T2D. Furthermore, a potential gene-gene interaction involving ENPP1 and GHSR was suggested in the best two-locus GMDR model (P = 0.021). The significant three-locus GMDR model (P < 0.001) was also identified among ADIPOQ, GHSR and TCF7L2. Analyses using logistic regression models confirmed the gene-gene interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the SNPs from the T2D-related genes may contribute to the risk of DN in T2D independently and/or in an interactive manner in Taiwanese T2D patients.

19509102|t|Genetic variants of TCF7L2 are associated with insulin resistance and related metabolic phenotypes in Taiwanese adolescents and Caucasian young adults.
19509102|a|OBJECTIVES: The effect of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on glucose homeostasis is considered primarily due to impaired insulin secretion in European populations. Because we previously demonstrated that TCF7L2 rs290487 near the 3' end of TCF7L2 was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Taiwanese subjects, we aimed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the associations of rs290487 with T2D. METHODS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with glucose/insulin homeostasis as well as other quantitative metabolic phenotypes using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test in 525 Taiwanese adolescent twin-pairs and siblings. The results were further replicated in 116 nondiabetic normotensive Caucasian young adults. RESULTS: Among the 18 SNPs, rs290487 C allele was significantly associated with higher 60-, 90-, and 120-min glucose concentrations (P = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively); higher 60- and 90-min insulin concentrations (P = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively); and a lower insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.04). No association was found for rs290487 with measures of insulin secretion. The rs290487 C allele was also associated with HOMA-IR (P = 0.005) and insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.01) in Caucasian young adults. Another SNP, rs10749127 C allele located in intron 4, was also associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, including elevated systolic (P = 0.02) and diastolic (P = 2.0 x 10(-4)) blood pressure, triglycerides (P = 7.0 x 10(-4)), and uric acid (P = 0.03). In a meta-analysis, the rs290487 C allele was confirmed to be associated with an increased risk of T2D (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.19; P = 0.005) across East Asian populations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an important role for T2D risk-conferring gene TCF7L2 in insulin resistance in both Taiwanese and Caucasian youth and underscore the emerging role of Wnt signaling in insulin resistance.

19526209|t|Is the thrifty genotype hypothesis supported by evidence based on confirmed type 2 diabetes- and obesity-susceptibility variants?
19526209|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: According to the thrifty genotype hypothesis, the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity is a consequence of genetic variants that have undergone positive selection during historical periods of erratic food supply. The recent expansion in the number of validated type 2 diabetes- and obesity-susceptibility loci, coupled with access to empirical data, enables us to look for evidence in support (or otherwise) of the thrifty genotype hypothesis using proven loci. METHODS: We employed a range of tests to obtain complementary views of the evidence for selection: we determined whether the risk allele at associated 'index' single-nucleotide polymorphisms is derived or ancestral, calculated the integrated haplotype score (iHS) and assessed the population differentiation statistic fixation index (F (ST)) for 17 type 2 diabetes and 13 obesity loci. RESULTS: We found no evidence for significant differences for the derived/ancestral allele test. None of the studied loci showed strong evidence for selection based on the iHS score. We find a high F (ST) for rs7901695 at TCF7L2, the largest type 2 diabetes effect size found to date. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide some evidence for selection at specific loci, but there are no consistent patterns of selection that provide conclusive confirmation of the thrifty genotype hypothesis. Discovery of more signals and more causal variants for type 2 diabetes and obesity is likely to allow more detailed examination of these issues.

19533015|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2-gene polymorphism is related to fasting C peptide in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).
19533015|a|Common polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes in different populations and recently with LADA, but not with type 1 diabetes. The aim of our study was to investigate association between the rs7903146 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene and LADA in Polish patients. Link between the "high risk for type 2 diabetes genotype" with clinical features was analyzed. 68 newly diagnosed patients with LADA and 195 healthy controls were genotyped for the rs7903146 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene using the PCR-based RFLP method. Fasting C peptide level was measured by ELISA. We observed increased frequencies of the TT genotype of the rs7903146 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene in LADA patients compared to controls (15 vs. 6%, P = 0.03). Fasting C peptide serum concentration was significantly lower in group of patients with LADA carrying the TT genotype (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the data from this study confirmed previous results showing genetic similarities between patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes. Non-autoimmune mechanism may be related to beta cell dysfunction in patients with LADA.

19573884|t|Preliminary report: No association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and euglycemic-clamp-derived insulin sensitivity in a mixed-age cohort.
19573884|a|There are conflicting reports about the significance of TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146, a single nucleotide polymorphism found to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in several genomewide association studies, and insulin sensitivity. The association of rs7903146 and euglycemic-clamp-derived insulin sensitivity was tested in a cohort of children and their parents. Four hundred seventy whites (from 226 families) and 89 African Americans (from 48 families) were included in the analysis. No significant associations were seen between rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity. Adjusted genotype means were consistent across races and generational subgroups.

19585101|t|A susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes confers substantial risk for diabetes complicating cystic fibrosis.
19585101|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin-requiring diabetes affects 25-50% of young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the cause of diabetes in CF is unknown, recent heritability studies in CF twins and siblings indicate that genetic modifiers play a substantial role. We sought to assess whether genes conferring risk for diabetes in the general population may play a risk modifying role in CF. METHODS: We tested whether a family history of type 2 diabetes affected diabetes risk in CF patients in 539 families in the CF Twin and Sibling family-based study. A type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene (transcription factor 7-like 2, or TCF7L2) was evaluated for association with diabetes in CF using 998 patients from the family-based study and 802 unrelated CF patients in an independent case-control study. RESULTS: Family history of type 2 diabetes increased the risk of diabetes in CF (OR 3.1; p = 0.0009). A variant in TCF7L2 associated with type 2 diabetes (the T allele at rs7903146) was associated with diabetes in CF in the family study (p = 0.004) and in the case-control study (p = 0.02; combined p = 0.0002). In the family-based study, variation in TCF7L2 increased the risk of diabetes about three-fold (HR 1.75 per allele, 95% CI 1.3-2.4; p = 0.0006), and decreased the mean age at diabetes diagnosis by 7 years. In CF patients not treated with systemic glucocorticoids, the effect of TCF7L2 was even greater (HR 2.9 per allele, 95% CI 1.7-4.9, p = 0.00011). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A genetic variant conferring risk for type 2 diabetes in the general population is a modifier of risk for diabetes in CF.

19592620|t|Examination of type 2 diabetes loci implicates CDKAL1 as a birth weight gene.
19592620|a|OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have found that reduced birth weight is associated with type 2 diabetes later in life; however, the underlying mechanism for this correlation remains unresolved. Recently, association has been demonstrated between low birth weight and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE loci, regions that were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In order to investigate whether type 2 diabetes risk-conferring alleles associate with low birth weight in our Caucasian childhood cohort, we examined the effects of 20 such loci on this trait. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 5,465 Caucasian children with recorded birth weights, we investigated the association of the previously reported type 2 diabetes-associated variation at 20 loci including TCF7L2, HHEX-IDE, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, and JAZF1 with birth weight. RESULTS: Our data show that the minor allele of rs7756992 (P = 8 x 10(-5)) at the CDKAL1 locus is strongly associated with lower birth weight, whereas a perfect surrogate for variation previously implicated for the trait at the same locus only yielded nominally significant association (P = 0.01; r(2) rs7756992 = 0.677). However, association was not detected with any of the other type 2 diabetes loci studied. CONCLUSIONS: We observe association between lower birth weight and type 2 diabetes risk-conferring alleles at the CDKAL1 locus. Our data show that the same genetic locus that has been identified as a marker for type 2 diabetes in previous studies also influences birth weight.

19602480|t|Tissue-specific alternative splicing of TCF7L2.
19602480|a|Common variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been identified as the strongest genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms by which these non-coding variants increase risk for T2D are not well-established. We used 13 expression assays to survey mRNA expression of multiple TCF7L2 splicing forms in up to 380 samples from eight types of human tissue (pancreas, pancreatic islets, colon, liver, monocytes, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines) and observed a tissue-specific pattern of alternative splicing. We tested whether the expression of TCF7L2 splicing forms was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7903146 and rs12255372, located within introns 3 and 4 of the gene and most strongly associated with T2D. Expression of two splicing forms was lower in pancreatic islets with increasing counts of T2D-associated alleles of the SNPs: a ubiquitous splicing form (P = 0.018 for rs7903146 and P = 0.020 for rs12255372) and a splicing form found in pancreatic islets, pancreas and colon but not in other tissues tested here (P = 0.009 for rs12255372 and P = 0.053 for rs7903146). Expression of this form in glucose-stimulated pancreatic islets correlated with expression of proinsulin (r(2) = 0.84-0.90, P < 0.00063). In summary, we identified a tissue-specific pattern of alternative splicing of TCF7L2. After adjustment for multiple tests, no association between expression of TCF7L2 in eight types of human tissue samples and T2D-associated genetic variants remained significant. Alternative splicing of TCF7L2 in pancreatic islets warrants future studies. GenBank Accession Numbers: FJ010164-FJ010174.

19615048|t|Type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2 polymorphism is not associated with fetal and postnatal growth in two birth cohort studies.
19615048|a|BACKGROUND: An inverse association between birth weight and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood has been reported. This association may be explained by common genetic variants related to insulin secretion and resistance, since insulin is the most important growth factor in fetal life. The objective of this study was to examine whether T2D gene polymorphism TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with growth patterns from fetal life until infancy. METHODS: This study was performed in two independent birth cohort studies, one prospective population-based (Generation R), and one of subjects born small-for-gestational-age (SGA cohort). Fetal growth was assessed by ultrasounds in second and third trimesters of pregnancy in Generation R. Growth in infancy was assessed in both cohorts at birth and at 6, 12 and 24 months postnatally. TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 3,419 subjects in Generation R and in 566 subjects in the SGA cohort. RESULTS: Minor allele frequency did not differ significantly (p = 0.47) between Generation R (T-allele: 28.7%) and the SGA cohort (T-allele: 29.8%). No differences at birth were found in gestational age or size (head circumference, length, weight) between the genotypes in either cohort. TCF7L2 genotype was also not associated with any pre- or postnatal growth characteristic in either Generation R or the SGA cohort. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for an association between TCF7L2 genotype and fetal and early postnatal growth. Furthermore, this TCF7L2 polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of SGA.

19636253|t|Evaluation of risk prediction updates from commercial genome-wide scans.
19636253|a|PURPOSE: Commercial internet-based companies offer genome-wide scans to predict the risk of common diseases and personalize nutrition and lifestyle recommendations. These risk estimates are updated with every new gene discovery. METHODS: To assess the benefits of updating risk information in commercial genome-wide scans, we compared type 2 diabetes risk predictions based on TCF7L2 alone, 18 polymorphisms alone, and 18 polymorphisms plus age, sex, and body mass index. Analyses were performed using data from the Rotterdam study, a prospective, population-based study among individuals aged 55 years and older. Data were available from 5297 participants. RESULTS: The actual prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the study population was 20%. Predicted risks were below average for carriers of the TCF7L2 CC genotype (predicted risk 17.6%) and above average for the CT and TT genotypes (20.8% and 28.0%). Adding the other 17 polymorphisms caused 34% of participants to be reclassified (i.e., switched between below and above average): 24% of the CC carriers changed to increased risk, 52% and 6% of the CT and TT carriers changed to decreased risk. Including information on age, sex, and body mass index caused 29% to change categories (27%, 31%, and 19% for CC, CT, and TT carriers, respectively). In total, 39% of participants changed categories once when risk factors were updated, and 11% changed twice, i.e., back to their initial risk category. CONCLUSION: Updating risk factors may produce contradictory information about an individual's risk status over time, which is undesirable if lifestyle and nutritional recommendations vary accordingly.

19643578|t|Genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes with pharmacologic intervention in African-American patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
19643578|a|An increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients has been observed. Exposure to antipsychotics (APs) has been shown to induce metabolic dysregulation in some patients but not all treated patients. We hypothesized that important candidate genes for T2D may increase risk for T2D in African-American patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. The PAARTNERS study comprises African-American families with at least one proband with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. The current study of PAARTNERS SCZ and schizoaffective disorder cases (N=820) examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within select T2D candidate genes including transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), calpain 10 (CAPN10), and ectoenzyme nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENNP1) for association with prevalent T2D. We report the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) with T2D under both additive and recessive models for the risk allele T. Specifically, the odds ratio (OR) for having T2D was 1.4 (p=0.03) under an additive model and 2.4 (p=0.004) under a recessive model. We also report a marginally significant TCF7L2 by AP treatment interaction that should be investigated in future studies. CAPN10 (rs3792267) was marginally associated with T2D with OR=1.5 (p=0.08) when considering the model GG vs. AG/AA with risk allele G. ENPP1 (rs1044498) was not associated with T2D. We conclude TCF7L2, a risk factor for T2D in the general population, is also a risk factor for T2D in African-American patients with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. Research is needed to determine if T2D associated polymorphisms are of interest in the pharmacogenetics and future treatment choices of antipsychotics in African-American patients.

19713311|t|TCF7L2 polymorphism associates with new-onset diabetes after transplantation.
19713311|a|New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious and frequent complication in transplant recipients. Whether NODAT shares the same susceptibility genes as type 2 diabetes is unknown. In this multicenter study, we genotyped 1076 white patients without diabetes at transplantation for 11 polymorphisms that associate with type 2 diabetes. We defined NODAT as a fasting plasma glucose > or =126 mg/dl on at least two occasions or de novo hypoglycemic therapy. We compared clinical and genetic factors between patients who developed NODAT within 6 mo of transplantation (n = 118; incidence 11%) and patients without diabetes (n = 958). In multivariate analysis, NODAT significantly associated with the following characteristics: TCF7L2 polymorphism (odds ratio [OR] 1.60 per each T allele; P = 0.002), age (OR 1.03 per year; P < 0.001), body mass index at transplantation (OR 1.09 per unit; P < 0.001), tacrolimus use (OR 2.26; P < 0.001), and the occurrence of a corticoid-treated acute rejection episode (OR 2.78; P < 0.001). In summary, our data show that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes in the general population, also associates with NODAT.

19741467|t|Association of common type 2 diabetes risk gene variants and posttransplantation diabetes mellitus in renal allograft recipients in Korea.
19741467|a|BACKGROUND: Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a major metabolic complication in renal transplant recipients. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several genes associated with type 2 diabetes. Here, we examined the association between PTDM and 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 15 genes in a cohort of renal allograft recipients in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 589 patients who received kidney transplants between 1989 and 2007, without a history of diabetes and had a pretransplant fasting glucose less than 5.5 mmol/L were included in this study. We analyzed the association between the PTDM development and the following SNPs: TCF7L2 rs7903146, SLC30A8 rs13266634, HHEX (rs1111875, rs7923837, and rs5015480), CDKAL1 rs10946398, CDKN2A/B rs10811661, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, FTO rs8050136, WFS1 rs734312, JAZF1 rs864745, CDC123/CAMK1D rs12779790, TSPAN8 rs7961581, THADA rs7578597, ADAMTS9 rs4607103, NOTCH2 rs1092391, and KCNQ1 rs2237892. RESULTS: Eight SNPs in six genes were significantly associated with the PTDM development: TCF7L2 rs7903146 (odds ratio [OR]=2.20, P =0.016), SLC30A8 rs13266634 (OR=1.52, P =0.003), HHEX rs1111875 (OR=1.47, P =0.007), HHEX rs7923837 (OR=2.32, P =0.014), HHEX rs5015480 (OR=1.59, P =0.003), CDKAL1 rs10946398 (OR=1.43, P =0.008), CDKN2A/B rs10811661 (OR=1.33, P =0.039), and KCNQ1 rs2237892 (OR=1.46, P =0.009). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that genetic variations in TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and KCNQ1 are associated with PTDM in Korea.

19789636|t|Alternative splicing of TCF7L2 gene in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue and risk of type 2 diabetes.
19789636|a|BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146 and rs12255372 located within TCF7L2 gene have been identified as the strongest common genetic risk factors for development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We hypothesized that these genetic variants might increase the risk of T2D through regulation of alternative splicing or expression level of TCF7L2 in human adipose tissue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Expression of 13 assays detecting alternatively spliced forms of TCF7L2 was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) in paired biopsies of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue from 159 obese individuals (BMI 54.6+/-12.2 kg/m(2)). TCF7L2 expression in both types of adipose tissue was not associated with SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372, T2D status and blood levels of glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Expression of assays "ex12-13", "ex12-14" and "ex13-13a" detecting C-terminal alternative exons of TCF7L2 was higher in subcutaneous compared to omental adipose tissue by 1.46 fold (p = 6.5x10(-15)), 1.41 fold (p = 1.4x10(-9)) and 1.26 fold (p = 4.7x10(-6)) in the control group and by 1.86 fold (p = 1.7x10(-4)), 1.77 fold (p = 7.3x10(-4)) and 1.58 fold (p = 6.1x10(-4)) in the T2D group. A pathway enrichment analysis on transcripts significantly co-expressed with TCF7L2 in a microarray set combined with individual expression assays, suggested tissue-specific roles of TCF7L2 splicing forms in regulation of transcription, signal transduction and cell adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of TCF7L2 alternatively spliced forms may have different functional roles in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue but is not associated with SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 or T2D status.

19799532|t|Influence of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-dynamics of sulfonylurea drugs.
19799532|a|Sulfonylurea drugs including chlorpropamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide, glipizide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and glimepiride are the most widely used oral hypoglycaemic agents in people with type 2 diabetes. This review investigates the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulfonylurea drugs. CYP2C9 is the major enzyme involved in sulfonylurea drug metabolism. CYP2C9 variant allele carriers have significant lower apparent clearance of these medicines. CYP2C19 genotype is more influential for gliclazide pharmacokinetics when compared to CYP2C9. Sulfonylurea pharmacodynamics is affected by several genes. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1, ABCC8 gene) and K+ inward rectifier Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have been correlated to significant variation in sulfonylurea response. Diabetics with the SUR1 exon 33 G allele are more sensitive to gliclazide and the rs5210 variant of the KCNJ11 gene was associated with improved clinical efficacy of gliclazide. Carriers of Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants are more likely to fail sulfonylurea therapy. On the other hand, patients with HNF-1alpha mutations had a significant greater response to gliclazide when compared to those with type 2 diabetes. The Arg972 polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) may lead to secondary failure of sulfonylurea therapy. Calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) polymorphism has also been linked to sulfonylurea drug response. Despite the available evidence, larger population studies that investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulfonylurea drugs are needed to investigate the influence of key SNPs amidst all potential contributing factors to variability in response to these which inturn will provide information to optimise sulfonylurea use in people with diabetes.

19806338|t|TCF7L2 genetic variants and progression to diabetes in the Chinese population: pleiotropic effects on insulin secretion and insulin resistance.
19806338|a|TCF7L2 genetic variants were associated with progression to type 2 diabetes in Europeans. However, the role of TCF7L2 in type 2 diabetes remained uncertain in Chinese. Seventeen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,094 subjects of Chinese origin from the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance family study. At baseline, the rs7903146 T allele in the exon 4 linkage disequilibrium (LD) block were associated with lower insulinogenic index at 60 min (P = 0.01), while the rs290481 G allele near the 3' end was associated with higher 2-h post-challenge glucose (P = 0.003) and insulin concentration (P = 0.02), elevated systolic (P = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.006), lower waist circumference (P = 0.01), and increased steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration measured with modified insulin suppression test (P = 0.02). Over an average follow-up period of 5.43 years, participants with the rs7903146 T allele or variants in the same LD block, but not those with the rs290481 G allele, were more likely to progress to diabetes (hazard ratio = 2.61, 95% confidence interval, 1.27-5.39, P = 0.009) than were non-carriers. TCF7L2 gene expression was inversely associated with SSPG in human visceral (r = -0.73, P = 0.006) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (r = -0.62, P = 0.03). TCF7L2 may exert pleiotropic effects on insulin secretion or insulin resistance. However, only variants associated with impaired beta-cell function predict progression to diabetes in Chinese.

19808892|t|Combined risk allele score of eight type 2 diabetes genes is associated with reduced first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps.
19808892|a|OBJECTIVE: At least 20 type 2 diabetes loci have now been identified, and several of these are associated with altered beta-cell function. In this study, we have investigated the combined effects of eight known beta-cell loci on insulin secretion stimulated by three different secretagogues during hyperglycemic clamps. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 447 subjects originating from four independent studies in the Netherlands and Germany (256 with normal glucose tolerance [NGT]/191 with impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) underwent a hyperglycemic clamp. A subset had an extended clamp with additional glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and arginine (n = 224). We next genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms in TCF7L2, KCNJ11, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, HHEX/IDE, CDKN2A/B, SLC30A8, and MTNR1B and calculated a risk allele score by risk allele counting. RESULTS: The risk allele score was associated with lower first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (P = 7.1 x 10(-6)). The effect size was equal in subjects with NGT and IGT. We also noted an inverse correlation with the disposition index (P = 1.6 x 10(-3)). When we stratified the study population according to the number of risk alleles into three groups, those with a medium- or high-risk allele score had 9 and 23% lower first-phase GSIS. Second-phase GSIS, insulin sensitivity index and GLP-1, or arginine-stimulated insulin release were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: A combined risk allele score for eight known beta-cell genes is associated with the rapid first-phase GSIS and the disposition index. The slower second-phase GSIS, GLP-1, and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion are not associated, suggesting that especially processes involved in rapid granule recruitment and exocytosis are affected in the majority of risk loci.

19825152|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms and inflammatory markers before and after treatment with fenofibrate.
19825152|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation is implicated in causing diabetes. We tested whether transcription factor 7 like-2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms (rs12255372 and rs7903146), consistently associated with type 2 diabetes, are associated with plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers before and after three weeks of daily treatment with fenofibrate. METHODS: Men and women in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study (n = 1025, age 49 +/- 16 y) were included. All participants suspended use of lipid-lowering drugs for three weeks and were then given 160 mg/day of fenofibrate for three weeks. Inflammatory markers and lipids were measured before and after fenofibrate. ANOVA was used to test for differences across TCF7L2 genotypes. RESULTS: Under the additive or dominant model, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the concentrations of inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1) across TCF7L2 genotypes in the period before or after treatment. For both rs12255372 and rs7903146, homozygote T-allele carriers had significantly higher (P < 0.05) post-fenofibrate concentrations of MCP-1 in the recessive model. No other significant associations were detected. CONCLUSION: Overall these data show no association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and the inflammatory markers suggesting that the effects of TCF7L2 on diabetes may not be via inflammation.

19845015|t|Expression of the diabetes-associated gene TCF7L2 in adult mouse brain.
19845015|a|Polymorphisms of the gene TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) are strongly associated with the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 is important in the development of peripheral organs such as adipocytes, pancreas, and the intestine. However, very little is known about its expression elsewhere. In this study we used in situ hybridization histochemistry to show that TCF7L2 has a unique expression pattern in the mouse brain. TCF7L2 is expressed in two distinct populations. First, it is highly expressed in thalamic and tectal structures. Additionally, TCF7L2 mRNA is expressed at moderate to low levels in specific cells of the hypothalamus, preoptic nucleus, and circumventricular organs. Collectively, these patterns of expression suggest that TCF7L2 has distinct functions within the brain, with a general role in the development and maintenance of thalamic and midbrain neurons, and then a distinct role in autonomic homeostasis.

19864407|t|Effects of TCF7L2 polymorphisms on glucose values after a lifestyle intervention.
19864407|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 is the strongest locus linked to type 2 diabetes that has been identified thus far, and rs7903146 is the most significantly associated variant. Few intervention studies have shown that it has negative effects on metabolic improvement after lifestyle programs. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the effects of this variant on lifestyle intervention-induced changes in glucose values and metabolic variables at 1- and 4-y follow-ups. DESIGN: The rs7903146 variant was genotyped in 335 nondiabetic, dysmetabolic participants in a randomized lifestyle intervention trial. RESULTS: Subjects with the unfavorable TT genotype showed higher values of fasting glucose and lower homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function at baseline. Lifestyle modifications were successful in the amelioration of metabolic traits in all genetic subgroups after 1 y. At 4-y follow-up most of the metabolic benefits had disappeared. In a multiple regression model, values for glucose and homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function at 4 y were significantly associated with the T allele (for glucose and homeostasis model assessments, respectively: beta = 6.6; 95% CI: 2.5, 10.7; P = 0.001; and beta = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.54, -0.20; P < 0.001) but not with intervention. There was no interaction between genotype and intervention. After 1 y, impaired fasting glucose and diabetes incidence were inversely associated with intervention. After 4 y, the presence of a T allele was associated with impaired fasting glucose (odds ratio: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.53, 6.04; P = 0.001) and diabetes (odds ratio: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.00, 6.96; P = 0.05) but not with intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modifications improved the metabolic pattern in all genetic subgroups. At the end of the trial, however, weight gain occurred, and carriers of the T allele developed first hyperglycemia and decreased insulin secretion, which suggests the need for different "after-care" preventive approaches tailored to each genotype's metabolic risk.

19885641|t|Association of a common variant in TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Palestinian population.
19885641|a|Recent genome-wide association studies have provided an important resource for furthering our understanding of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) disease mechanisms. Most of these T2DM gene loci affect insulin secretion. We examined the association of rs7903146 variant in the transcription factor 7 like 2 gene (TCF7L2) with T2DM in 333 Palestinian subjects (219 were type 2 diabetic patients and 114 normoglycemic subjects). The rs7903146 variant of TCF7L2 significantly increased T2DM risk with an allelic odds ratio of 3.34 (95% CI [1.99-5.60], P < 0.0001). No significant association was observed between TCF7L2 genotypes and covariates of age, gender and BMI or any tested metabolic trait (total cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose) in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals (P > 0.05). Among the diabetic group, the TT genotype carrier have earlier age at diagnosis compared with CC and CT carriers (P = 0.013). This is the first study conducted on this gene in the Palestinian population and provides valuable information for comparison with other ethnic groups.

19898815|t|Regulation of wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signalling in pancreatic islets from wild-type and obese mice.
19898815|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: TCF7L2 is a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene and downstream effector of canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signalling. However, it is unknown whether this pathway is active in adult pancreatic islets in vivo, and whether it is regulated in obesity. METHODS: We analysed activation of endogenous WNT signalling in the endocrine pancreas from wild-type and obese mice (ob/ob) using a reporter transgene (Topgal). Regulation of WNT signalling was compared using gene chip experiments from isolated pancreatic islets. Activation of canonical WNT signalling in pancreatic islets and the mouse beta cell line MIN6 was measured using immunoblotting for cytosolic beta-catenin. RESULTS: Endogenous canonical WNT signalling was absent in the adult endocrine pancreas in both wild-type and obese mice. We identified WNT4 as an abundant WNT signalling molecule in adult pancreatic islets that is induced in two different insulin-resistant mouse models. Increased expression of WNT4 inhibited canonical WNT signalling in pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Canonical WNT signalling is not active in adult beta cells in vivo. WNT4 provides a potential mechanism for suppression of canonical WNT signalling in obese mice.

19915463|t|Interactions between genetic factors that predict diabetes and dietary factors that ultimately impact on risk of diabetes.
19915463|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of the present review is to summarize recent advances in investigations of interactions between established genetic and dietary risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies reported that dietary factors related to carbohydrate quality and quantity, such as whole grains and glycemic load, might interact with transcription factor 7-like 2 variants in relation to T2D risk. The genetic predisposition defined by the combination of 10 established T2D risk alleles was found to modulate the association between Western dietary pattern (high intakes of red meat, processed meat, and low fiber) and T2D; a stronger association was observed in those with a high-risk genetic profile. Variants in genes HHEX, CDKN2A/2B, JAZF1, and IGF2BP2 were found to interact with prenatal nutrition in relation to T2D risk and glucose levels in later life. SUMMARY: The available data provide preliminary support for the gene-diet interactions in determining T2D. However, most findings have yet to be validated. Future studies will need agreed standards of study design and statistical power, dietary measurement, analytical methods, and replication strategies.

19920216|t|Neonatal growth and regeneration of beta-cells are regulated by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in normal and diabetic rats.
19920216|a|Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is critical for a variety of fundamental cellular processes. Here, we investigated the implication of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the in vivo regulation of beta-cell growth and regeneration in normal and diabetic rats. To this aim, TCF7L2, the distal effector of the canonical Wnt pathway, was knocked down in groups of normal and diabetic rats by the use of specific antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides. In other groups of diabetic rats, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was activated by the inhibition of its negative regulator GSK-3beta. GSK-3beta was inactivated by either LiCl or anti-GSK-3beta oligonucleotides. The beta-cell mass was evaluated by morphometry. beta-cell proliferation was assessed in vivo and in vitro by BrdU incorporation method. In vivo beta-cell neogenesis was estimated by the evaluation of PDX1-positive ductal cells and GLUT2-positive ductal cells and the number of beta cells budding from the ducts. We showed that the in vivo disruption of the canonical Wnt pathway resulted in the alteration of normal and compensatory growth of beta-cells mainly through the inhibition of beta-cell proliferation. Conversely, activation of the Wnt pathway through the inhibition of GSK-3beta had a significant stimulatory effect on beta-cell regeneration in diabetic rats. In vitro, GSK-3beta inactivation resulted in the stimulation of beta-cell proliferation. This was mediated by the stabilization of beta-catenin and the induction of cyclin D. Taken together, our results demonstrate the involvement of the canonical Wnt signaling in the neonatal regulation of normal and regenerative growth of pancreatic beta-cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that activation of this pathway by pharmacological maneuvers can efficiently improve beta-cell regeneration in diabetic rats. These findings might have potential clinical applications in the regenerative therapy of diabetes.

19924244|t|TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 is associated with coronary artery disease severity and mortality.
19924244|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 polymorphisms have been consistently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in different populations and type 2 diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery disease. This study aimed to evaluate the association between TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and coronary artery disease in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: two populations were studied in order to assess severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events incidence. Eight-hundred and eighty nine subjects who were referred for cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease diagnosis were cross-sectionally evaluated for coronary lesions (atherosclerotic burden) and 559 subjects from the MASS-II Trial were prospectively followed-up for 5 years and assessed for major cardiovascular events incidence. As expected, rs7903146 T allele was associated with diabetes. Although diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of coronary lesions, no association between TCF7L2 genotype and coronary lesions was found in this subgroup. However, non-diabetic individuals carrying the T allele were associated with a significantly higher frequency of coronary lesions than non-diabetic non-carriers of the risk allele (adjusted OR = 2.32 95%CI 1.27-4.24, p = 0.006). Moreover, presence of multi-vessel coronary artery disease was also associated with the CT or TT genotypes in non-diabetics. Similarly, from the prospective sample analysis, non-diabetics carrying the CT/TT genotypes had significantly more composite cardiovascular end-points events than CC carriers (p = 0.049), mainly due to an increased incidence of death (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: rs7903146 T allele is associated with diabetes and, in non-diabetic individuals, with a higher prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events. name of registry site (see list below), registration number, trial registration URL in brackets.

19924301|t|Control of TCF-4 expression by VDR and vitamin D in the mouse mammary gland and colorectal cancer cell lines.
19924301|a|BACKGROUND: The vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway is important in the prevention and potentially in the treatment of many cancers. One important mechanism of VDR action is related to its interaction with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Agonist-bound VDR inhibits the oncogenic Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF pathway by interacting directly with beta-catenin and in some cells by increasing cadherin expression which, in turn, recruits beta-catenin to the membrane. Here we identify TCF-4, a transcriptional regulator and beta-catenin binding partner as an indirect target of the VDR pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this work, we show that TCF-4 (gene name TCF7L2) is decreased in the mammary gland of the VDR knockout mouse as compared to the wild-type mouse. Furthermore, we show 1,25(OH)2D3 increases TCF-4 at the RNA and protein levels in several human colorectal cancer cell lines, the effect of which is completely dependent on the VDR. In silico analysis of the human and mouse TCF7L2 promoters identified several putative VDR binding elements. Although TCF7L2 promoter reporters responded to exogenous VDR, and 1,25(OH)2D3, mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, showed that the increase in TCF7L2 did not require recruitment of the VDR to the identified elements and indicates that the regulation by VDR is indirect. This is further confirmed by the requirement of de novo protein synthesis for this up-regulation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although it is generally assumed that binding of beta-catenin to members of the TCF/LEF family is cancer-promoting, recent studies have indicated that TCF-4 functions instead as a transcriptional repressor that restricts breast and colorectal cancer cell growth. Consequently, we conclude that the 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR-mediated increase in TCF-4 may have a protective role in colon cancer as well as diabetes and Crohn's disease.

19933996|t|Examination of all type 2 diabetes GWAS loci reveals HHEX-IDE as a locus influencing pediatric BMI.
19933996|a|OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have found that BMI in early life influences the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Our goal was to investigate if any type 2 diabetes variants uncovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) impact BMI in childhood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing GWAS of pediatric BMI in our cohort, we investigated the association of pediatric BMI with 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 18 type 2 diabetes loci uncovered through GWAS, consisting of ADAMTS9, CDC123-CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, EXT2, FTO, HHEX-IDE, IGF2BP2, the intragenic region on 11p12, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, MTNR1B, NOTCH2, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, THADA, and TSPAN8-LGR5. We randomly partitioned our cohort exactly in half in order to have a discovery cohort (n = 3,592) and a replication cohort (n = 3,592). RESULTS: Our data show that the major type 2 diabetes risk-conferring G allele of rs7923837 at the HHEX-IDE locus was associated with higher pediatric BMI in both the discovery (P = 0.0013 and survived correction for 20 tests) and replication (P = 0.023) sets (combined P = 1.01 x 10(-4)). Association was not detected with any other known type 2 diabetes loci uncovered to date through GWAS except for the well-established FTO. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the same genetic HHEX-IDE variant, which is associated with type 2 diabetes from previous studies, also influences pediatric BMI.

19934000|t|TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 affects the risk of type 2 diabetes by modulating incretin action.
19934000|a|OBJECTIVE: Common variants in the gene TCF7L2 confer the largest effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes. The present study was undertaken to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which this gene affects type 2 diabetes risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight subjects with risk-conferring TCF7L2 genotypes (TT or TC at rs7903146) and 10 matched subjects with wild-type genotype (CC) underwent 5-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion, and graded glucose infusion (GGI). Mathematical modeling was used to quantify insulin-secretory profiles during OGTT and glucose infusion protocols. The incretin effect was assessed from ratios of the insulin secretory rates (ISR) during oral and isoglycemic glucose infusions. Dose-response curves relating insulin secretion to glucose concentrations were derived from the GGI. RESULTS: beta-cell responsivity to oral glucose was 50% lower (47 +/- 4 vs. 95 +/- 15 x 10(9) min(-1); P = 0.01) in the group of subjects with risk-conferring TCF7L2 genotypes compared with control subjects. The incretin effect was also reduced by 30% (32 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 4%; P = 0.02) in the at-risk group. The lower incretin effect occurred despite similar glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) responses to oral glucose. The ISR response to intravenous glucose over a physiologic glucose concentration range (5-9 mmol/l) was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 appears to affect risk of type 2 diabetes, at least in part, by modifying the effect of incretins on insulin secretion. This is not due to reduced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP but rather due to the effect of TCF7L2 on the sensitivity of the beta-cell to incretins. Treatments that increase incretin sensitivity may decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes.

20002468|t|Role of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity in the pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and emerging treatment strategies.
20002468|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by persistent and progressive deterioration of glucose tolerance. Both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion contribute to development of Type 2 diabetes. However, whilst insulin resistance is fully apparent in the pre-diabetic condition, impairment of insulin secretion worsens over the time, being paralleled by a progressive decline in both pancreatic B-cell function and B-cell mass. Intense research has identified a number of genetic variants that may predispose to impaired B-cell function, but such predisposition can be precipitated and worsened by toxic effects of hyperglycaemia (glucotoxicity) and elevated levels of free fatty acids (lipotoxicity). All these aspects of the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review. Moreover, treatments that target reduction in glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity are outlined, including emerging strategies that target the role of glucagon-like peptide 1 and sodium glucose co-transporter 2.

20007922|t|Can the genetics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes shed light on the genetics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults?
20007922|a|The pathophysiology of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is considered less understood than its much better characterized counterparts of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), where its clinical presentation exhibits some features of each of these two main diseases, earning it a reputation as being "type 1.5 diabetes". The etiology of LADA remains unknown, but a genetic component has been implicated from recent reports of T1D and T2D genes playing a role in its pathogenesis. One way to shed much needed light on the classification of LADA is to determine the discrete genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of this specific phenotype and to determine to what extent LADA shares genetic similarities with T1D and T2D. For instance, no conclusive support for a role of the T1D-associated INS gene has been reported in T2D; conversely, but similarly, no evidence has been found for the role of the T2D-associated genes IDE/HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, and TCF7L2 in T1D. However, and somewhat at odds with current thinking, TCF7L2, the most strongly associated gene with T2D to date, is strongly associated with LADA, a disorder considered by the World Health Organization to be a slowly progressing form of T1D. In this review, we address recent advances in the genetics of T1D and T2D and how such discoveries have in turn shed some light on the genetics of LADA as being potentially at the "genetic intersection" of these two major diseases.

20018066|t|Epistatic interactions of CDKN2B-TCF7L2 for risk of type 2 diabetes and of CDKN2B-JAZF1 for triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio longitudinal change: evidence from the Framingham Heart Study.
20018066|a|Fifteen known type 2 diabetes (T2D) gene variants were assessed for their associations with T2D status in 228 T2D families from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Original, Offspring, and Children Cohorts. Bayesian approach was used to test single-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association followed by logistic regression. Bayesian and logic regression approaches were used to test multiple SNP association searching for the best combinations of variants followed by logistic regression reconfirmation. The significant variants for T2D risk were also tested for their main and interacting effects on triglyceride (TG)/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio change derived from four point measures across time. This slope phenotype was made available using mixed model growth curve approach from 155 T2D families in the FHS Offspring Cohort. RESULTS: CDKN2B rs10811661 (p = 0.042), TCF7L2 rs4506565 (p = 0.004), and JAZF1 rs864745 (p = 0.04) were individually associated with risk of T2D (OR = 1.0-2.0; effect size <1%). CDKN2B and TCF7L2 were found with significant main (p = 0.02, 0.01) and interacting (p = 0.05) effects for increased (OR = 3.0) risk of T2D. CDKN2B and JAZF1 were found with significant main (p = 0.0002 and 0.034) and interacting (p = 0.001) effects on increased (beta = 0.42) TG/HDL ratio longitudinal change. These interacting effects were independent of effects of age and sex with effect sizes of 0.3-0.4% for risk of T2D or TG/HDL ratio longitudinal change. CONCLUSION: These synthetic approaches allowed for successful detection of CDKN2B and TCF7L2 interacting effect for T2D risk and CDKN2B and JAZF1 interacting effect on TG/HDL ratio increase over time among T2D families in the FHS. These interacting effects were consistent in conferring risk of T2D or progressive insulin resistance with modest effect sizes.

20028944|t|Gene variants of TCF7L2 influence weight loss and body composition during lifestyle intervention in a population at risk for type 2 diabetes.
20028944|a|OBJECTIVE: The impact of the diabetes risk gene transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) on body weight is unclear. As TCF7L2 is expressed in adipose tissue and involved in Wnt-dependent regulation of adipogenesis, we studied the impact of TCF7L2 variants on body composition and weight loss during lifestyle intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 309 German subjects at increased risk for type 2 diabetes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, and rs7895340 in TCF7L2 and performed oral glucose tolerance tests before and after a 9-month lifestyle intervention. Fat distribution was quantified using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy in a subgroup of 210 subjects. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding variables, we observed a negative impact of the type 2 diabetes allele of SNP rs7903146 on change in BMI (P = 0.0034) and on changes in nonvisceral (P = 0.0032) and visceral fat (P = 0.0165) during lifestyle intervention. An association of rs7903146 with lifestyle intervention-induced changes in insulin secretion, glucose concentrations, liver fat, or insulin sensitivity were not detected (all P > 0.2). Essentially the same results were obtained with SNP rs1255372. In contrast, we found no effects of SNPs rs11196205 and rs7895340 on change in BMI (all P > or = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that diabetes-associated alleles of TCF7L2 are associated with less weight loss in response to lifestyle intervention. Thus, diabetes-associated TCF7L2 gene variation predicts the success of lifestyle intervention in terms of weight loss and determines individual susceptibility toward environmental factors.

20032493|t|TCF7L2 rs7903146-macronutrient interaction in obese individuals' responses to a 10-wk randomized hypoenergetic diet.
20032493|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 associates with type 2 diabetes and may operate via impaired glucagon-like peptide 1 secretion, which is stimulated more by fat than by carbohydrate ingestion. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the interaction between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and dietary fat and carbohydrate [high-fat, low-carbohydrate: 40-45% of energy as fat (HF); compared with low-fat, high-carbohydrate: 20-25% of energy as fat (LF)] in obese individuals' responses to a 10-wk hypoenergetic diet (-600 kcal/d). DESIGN: European, obese participants (n = 771) were randomly assigned to receive an HF or an LF diet. Body weight, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), waist circumference (WC), resting energy expenditure (REE), fasting fat oxidation in percentage of REE (FatOx), homeostasis model assessed insulin release (HOMA-beta), and HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined at baseline and after the intervention; 739 individuals were genotyped for rs7903146. RESULTS: Average weight loss was 6.9 kg with the LF and 6.6 kg with the HF (difference between diets, NS) diet. Among individuals who were homozygous for the T-risk allele, those in the HF diet group experienced smaller weight losses (Deltaweight) (2.6 kg; P = 0.009; n = 622), smaller DeltaFFM (1.6 kg; P = 0.027; n = 609), smaller DeltaWC (3.3 cm; P = 0.010; n = 608), and a smaller DeltaHOMA-IR (1.3 units; P = 0.004; n = 615) than did the LF diet group. For C allele carriers, there were no differences between the HF and LF diet groups. For the HF diet group, each additional T allele was associated with a reduced loss of FM (0.67 kg; P = 0.019; n = 609). TCF7L2 rs7903146 was not associated with DeltaREE, DeltaFatOx, DeltaHOMA-beta, or dropout. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that obese individuals who are homozygous for the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-risk allele are more sensitive to LF than to HF weight-loss diets.

20033802|t|Evidence for neuroendocrine function of a unique splicing form of TCF7L2 in human brain, islets and gut.
20033802|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Variants in the TCF7L2 gene remain the strongest genetic associations with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Recently, we identified a unique splicing form of TCF7L2 expressed in pancreatic islets, pancreas and colon and detected by assay 'ex13-13b'. The expression of ex13-13b strongly correlated with proinsulin in glucose-stimulated pancreatic islets, suggesting a potential role for this form in the development of type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study was to further characterise this unique TCF7L2 splicing form in human tissues. METHODS: We used a panel of 34 human tissues and 80 human cell lines to measure the expression of assay ex13-13b with use of quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The highest expression of assay ex13-13b was detected in several areas of the brain (hypothalamus/thalamus, occipital lobe) and in neuronal cell line SHS5Y5. Low expression was confirmed in pancreatic islets, small intestine, pancreas and colon, while no expression was detected in other human tissues and cell lines. The expression of assay ex13-13b correlated with the gene for cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART, also known as CARTPT) in a panel of human tissues (n = 12, r = 0.85, p = 0.00046), pancreatic islets (n = 23, r = 0.62, p = 0.0016) and colon (n = 98, r = 0.54, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The significant correlation between expression of a unique splicing form of TCF7L2, named here TCF7L2-NE, and CART, the gene for an anorexigenic neurohormone expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, suggests that these transcripts may share neuroendocrine functions important for brain, gut and pancreatic islets.

20043145|t|Improvements in glucose homeostasis in response to regular exercise are influenced by the PPARG Pro12Ala variant: results from the HERITAGE Family Study.
20043145|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Exercise training improves glucose homeostasis, but large inter-individual differences are reported, suggesting a role of genetic factors. We investigated whether variants either confirmed or newly identified as diabetes susceptibility variants through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) modulate changes in phenotypes derived from an IVGTT in response to an endurance training programme. METHODS: We analysed eight polymorphisms in seven type 2 diabetes genes (CDKAL1 rs7756992; CDKN2A and CDKN2B rs10811661 and rs564398; HHEX rs7923837; IGF2BP2 rs4402960; KCNJ11 rs5215; PPARG rs1801282; and TCF7L2 rs7903146) in a maximum of 481 sedentary, non-diabetic white individuals, who participated in a 20-week endurance training programme. Associations were tested between the variants and changes in IVGTT-derived phenotypes. RESULTS: The only evidence of association with training response was found with PPARG rs1801282 (Pro12Ala). We observed that Ala carriers experienced greater increase in overall glucose tolerance (Deltaglucose disappearance index Ala/Ala 0.22 +/- 0.22, Pro/Ala 0.14 +/- 0.06, Pro/Pro 0.004 +/- 0.03; p = 0.0008), glucose effectiveness (Ala/Ala 0.28 +/- 0.41, Pro/Ala 0.44 +/- 0.14, Pro/Pro 0.09 +/- 0.06; p = 0.004), acute insulin response to glucose (Ala/Ala 64.21 +/- 37.73, Pro/Ala -11.92 +/- 40.30, Pro/Pro -46.30 +/- 14.70; p = 0.03) and disposition index (Ala/Ala 551.8 +/- 448.5, Pro/Ala 534.6 +/- 218.3, Pro/Pro -7.44 +/- 88.18; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Compared with Pro/Pro individuals, PPARG Ala carriers experienced greater improvements in glucose and insulin metabolism in response to regular endurance training. However, we did not find evidence of association between type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants recently identified through GWAS and glucose homeostasis response to exercise. Our results extend those of previous studies showing that Ala carriers appear to be more responsive to beneficial health effects of lifestyle interventions.

20043853|t|Prioritizing genes for follow-up from genome wide association studies using information on gene expression in tissues relevant for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
20043853|a|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful approach for identifying susceptibility loci associated with polygenetic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is still a daunting task to prioritize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from GWAS for further replication in different population. Several recent studies have shown that genetic variation often affects gene-expression at proximal (cis) as well as distal (trans) genomic locations by different mechanisms such as altering rate of transcription or splicing or transcript stability. METHODS: To prioritize SNPs from GWAS, we combined results from two GWAS related to T2DM, the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), with genome-wide expression data from pancreas, adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle of individuals with or without T2DM or animal models thereof to identify T2DM susceptibility loci. RESULTS: We identified 1,170 SNPs associated with T2DM with P < 0.05 in both GWAS and 243 genes that were located in the vicinity of these SNPs. Out of these 243 genes, we identified 115 differentially expressed in publicly available gene expression profiling data. Notably five of them, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, TCF7L2 and TSPAN8, have subsequently been shown to be associated with T2DM in different populations. To provide further validation of our approach, we reversed the approach and started with 26 known SNPs associated with T2DM and related traits. We could show that 12 (57%) (HHEX, HNF1B, IGF2BP2, IRS1, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, NOTCH2, PPARG, TCF7L2, THADA, TSPAN8 and WFS1) out of 21 genes located in vicinity of these SNPs were showing aberrant expression in T2DM from the gene expression profiling studies. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing of gene expression profiling data from different tissues of individuals with or without T2DM or animal models thereof is a powerful tool for prioritizing SNPs from WGAS for further replication studies.

20049090|t|Association between type 2 diabetes loci and measures of fatness.
20049090|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and insulin resistance. The majority of T2D patients are obese and obesity by itself may be a cause of insulin resistance. Our aim was to evaluate whether the recently identified T2D risk alleles are associated with human measures of fatness as characterized with Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genotypes and phenotypes of approximately 3,000 participants from cross-sectional ERF study were analyzed. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDKN2AB, CDKAL1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARG, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 were genotyped. We used linear regression to study association between individual SNPs and the combined allelic risk score with body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), fat percentage (FAT), waist circumference (WC) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Significant association was observed between rs8050136 (FTO) and BMI (p = 0.003), FMI (p = 0.007) and WC (p = 0.03); fat percentage was borderline significant (p = 0.053). No other SNPs alone or combined in a risk score demonstrated significant association to the measures of fatness. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: From the recently identified T2D risk variants only the risk variant of the FTO gene (rs8050136) showed statistically significant association with BMI, FMI, and WC.

20054294|t|KCNJ11 Lys23Glu and TCF7L2 rs290487(C/T) polymorphisms affect therapeutic efficacy of repaglinide in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.
20054294|a|This study showed that the polymorphisms KCNJ11 Lys23Glu and TCF7L2 rs290487(C/T) are associated with a heightened risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We also explored the effects of these polymorphisms on the efficacy of repaglinide therapy in Chinese patients with T2DM. A total of 259 patients with T2DM and 188 healthy controls were genotyped. Forty patients with various genotypes were randomly selected to undergo an 8-week repaglinide treatment regimen. Patients with the G allele of the KCNJ11 Lys23Glu polymorphism showed higher levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) (P < 0.05). After repaglinide treatment, patients with the GA or AA genotype showed higher levels of FPG, PPG, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) compared with patients with the GG genotype (P < 0.05). Patients with the C allele of TCF7L2 rs290487(C/T) had higher total cholesterol levels and lower body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.05). In patients with the TT genotype, the drug showed better efficacy with respect to levels of fasting insulin, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) than in patients with the CC or CT genotype (P < 0.05). The KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 polymorphisms were associated with repaglinide efficacy.

20056134|t|Insulin alters the expression of components of the Wnt signaling pathway including TCF-4 in the intestinal cells.
20056134|a|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological and experimental evidence that support the correlation between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and increased risks of colorectal cancer formation have led us to hypothesize the existence of molecular crosstalk between insulin and canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Insulin was shown to stimulate Wnt target gene expression, utilizing the effector of the Wnt signaling pathway. Whether insulin affects expression of components of Wnt pathway has not been extensively examined. METHODS: cDNA microarray was utilized to assess the effect of insulin on gene expression profile in the rat intestinal non-cancer IEC-6 cell line, followed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and reporter gene analyses in intestinal cancer and non-cancer cells. RESULTS: Insulin was shown to alter the expression of a dozen of Wnt pathway related genes including TCF-4 (=TCF7L2) and frizzled- (Fzd-4). The stimulatory effect of insulin on TCF-4 expression was then confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and luciferase reporter analyses, while the activation on Fzd-4 was confirmed by real-time PCR. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations suggest that insulin may crosstalk with the Wnt signaling pathway in a multi-level fashion, involving insulin regulation of the expression of Wnt target genes, a Wnt receptor, as well as mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway.

20081857|t|Genetic variation in GIPR influences the glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.
20081857|a|Glucose levels 2 h after an oral glucose challenge are a clinical measure of glucose tolerance used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We report a meta-analysis of nine genome-wide association studies (n = 15,234 nondiabetic individuals) and a follow-up of 29 independent loci (n = 6,958-30,620). We identify variants at the GIPR locus associated with 2-h glucose level (rs10423928, beta (s.e.m.) = 0.09 (0.01) mmol/l per A allele, P = 2.0 x 10(-15)). The GIPR A-allele carriers also showed decreased insulin secretion (n = 22,492; insulinogenic index, P = 1.0 x 10(-17); ratio of insulin to glucose area under the curve, P = 1.3 x 10(-16)) and diminished incretin effect (n = 804; P = 4.3 x 10(-4)). We also identified variants at ADCY5 (rs2877716, P = 4.2 x 10(-16)), VPS13C (rs17271305, P = 4.1 x 10(-8)), GCKR (rs1260326, P = 7.1 x 10(-11)) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 4.2 x 10(-10)) associated with 2-h glucose. Of the three newly implicated loci (GIPR, ADCY5 and VPS13C), only ADCY5 was found to be associated with type 2 diabetes in collaborating studies (n = 35,869 cases, 89,798 controls, OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.09-1.15, P = 4.8 x 10(-18)).

20082465|t|Pancreatic hypoplasia presenting with neonatal diabetes mellitus in association with congenital heart defect and developmental delay.
20082465|a|Congenital pancreatic hypoplasia is a rare cause of neonatal diabetes. We report on a series of three patients with pancreatic agenesis and congenital heart defects. All had abdominal scan evidence of pancreatic agenesis. In addition, Patient 1 had a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis; Patient 2 had a truncus arteriosus and Patient 3 had tetralogy of Fallot. Two of the three patients have developmental delay. All three patients were isolated cases within the family. Investigations included sequencing of GCK, ABCC8, IPF1, NEUROD1, PTF1A, HNF1B, INS, ISL1, NGN3, HHEX, G6PC2, TCF7L2, SOX4, FOXP3 (Patients 1 and 2), GATA4 and KCNJ11 genes (all three patients), but no mutations were found. Genetic investigation to exclude paternal UPD 6, methylation aberrations and duplications of 6q24 was also negative in all three. 22q11 deletion was excluded in all three patients. Array CGH in Patient (1) showed a approximately 250 kb, paternally inherited duplication of chromosome 12q [arr cgh 12q24.33 (B35:CHR12:131808577-132057649++) pat], not found in the other two patients. Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to pancreatic hypoplasia with congenital heart defects has been reported before and may represent a distinct condition. We discuss this rare association and review previously reported literature.

20092643|t|Large effects on body mass index and insulin resistance of fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) variants in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
20092643|a|BACKGROUND: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women of child-bearing age, mainly characterised by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, is often associated with insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. Its etiology and the role of IR and obesity in PCOS are not fully understood. We examined the influence of validated genetic variants conferring susceptibility to obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metabolic and PCOS-specific traits in patients with PCOS. METHODS: We conducted an association study in 386 patients with PCOS (defined by the Rotterdam-criteria) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or in proximity to the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), insulin-induced gene-2 (INSIG2), transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) and melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R). To compare the effect of FTO obesity risk alleles on BMI in patients with PCOS to unselected females of the same age range we genotyped 1,971 females from the population-based KORA-S4 study (Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung im Raum Augsburg, Survey 4). RESULTS: The FTO risk allele was associated with IR traits and measures of increased body weight. In addition, the TCF7L2 SNP was associated with body weight traits. For the SNPs in the vicinity of INSIG2 and MC4R and for the other examined phenotypes there was no evidence for an association. In PCOS the observed per risk allele effect of FTO intron 1 SNP rs9939609 on BMI was +1.56 kg/m2, whereas it was +0.46 kg/m2 in females of the same age range from the general population as shown previously. CONCLUSION: The stronger effect on body weight of the FTO SNP in PCOS might well have implications for the etiology of the disease.

20097709|t|Genotype and tissue-specific effects on alternative splicing of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene in humans.
20097709|a|CONTEXT: Noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TCF7L2 gene are confirmed risk factors for type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism by which they increase risk is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that associated SNPs alter TCF7L2 splicing and that splice forms have altered biological roles. DESIGN: Splice forms and 5' and 3' untranslated regions were characterized in sc adipose, muscle, liver, HepG2 cells, pancreas, and islet. Isoform-specific transcript levels were quantified in sc adipose. Alternative splice forms were characterized in HepG2 liver cells under glucose and insulin conditions and in SGBS cells with differentiation. Major isoforms were characterized by transfection. SETTING: The study was conducted at an ambulatory general clinical research center. PATIENTS: PATIENTS included 78 healthy, nondiabetic study subjects characterized for insulin sensitivity and secretion. RESULTS: We identified 32 alternatively spliced transcripts and multiple-length 3' untranslated region transcripts in adipose, muscle, islet, and pancreas. Alternative exons 3a, 12, 13, and 13a were observed in all tissues, whereas exon 13b was islet specific. Transcripts retaining exons 13 and 13a but not total TCF7L2 transcripts were significantly correlated with both obesity measures (P < 0.01) and rs7903146 genotype (P < 0.026) in sc adipose. Insulin (5-10 nm) suppressed all TCF7L2 isoforms in SGBS cells but suppressed exon 13a-containing isoforms most significantly (P < 0.001). The isoform distribution differed throughout SGBS cell differentiation. Isoforms with predicted early stop codons yielded stable proteins of the predicted size, bound beta-catenin, and targeted correctly to the nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Intronic TCF7L2 variants may regulate alternative transcript isoforms, which in turn may have distinct physiologic roles.

20099993|t|Understanding the genetic basis for adverse drug effects: the calcineurin inhibitors.
20099993|a|The calcineurin inhibitors-cyclosporine and tacrolimus-are the mainstay of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantation. These drugs produce severe adverse drug effects (ADEs) such as nephrotoxicity, posttransplantation diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Accumulated evidence suggests that the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure may be associated with specific DNA genotypes. In this review, the genes involved with the development of these disease processes are compared with those implicated in calcineurin inhibitor-induced ADEs. The renin-angiotensin system genes, cytokine-encoding genes, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 genes have been implicated in calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity, as well as in development of renal failure. A number of genes are implicated in contributing to diabetes, and these include the vitamin D receptor gene, VDR; hepatocyte nuclear factor genes, HNF; transcription factor 7-like 2 gene, TCF7L2; angiotensin-converting enzyme gene, ACE; cytokines; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene, PPARG; and others. Studies have suggested that the VDR, PPARG, HNF1A, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding cassette ABCC8 (which encodes the sulfonylurea receptor) genes are associated with calcineurin inhibitor-induced diabetes. The genes encoding for the angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase, and cytochrome P450 3A isoenzyme have been involved in the development of hypertension and in calcineurin inhibitor-induced hypertension. The genetic study of disease states can be the stepping stones for thoroughly understanding the genetic basis of ADEs. Gene polymorphisms are implicated in the development of diseases and corresponding disease-like ADEs. The disease-associated genes provide candidate genes for exploring ADEs and may provide genomic biomarkers for assessing the risk for developing severe calcineurin inhibitor-related ADEs as well as for developing preventive strategies.

20107109|t|The T-allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146 associates with a reduced compensation of insulin secretion for insulin resistance induced by 9 days of bed rest.
20107109|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the type 2 diabetes-associated T-allele of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 associates with impaired insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance induced by bed rest. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 38 healthy young Caucasian men were studied before and after bed rest using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique combined with indirect calorimetry preceded by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The TCF7L2 rs7903146 was genotyped using allelic discrimination performed with an ABI 7900 system. The genetic analyses were done assuming a dominant model of inheritance. RESULTS: The first-phase insulin response (FPIR) was significantly lower in carriers of the T-allele compared with carriers of the CC genotype before bed rest, with and without correction for insulin resistance. The incremental rise of FPIR in response to insulin resistance induced by bed rest was lower in carriers of the T-allele (P < 0.001). Fasting plasma glucagon levels were significantly lower in carriers of the T-allele before and after bed rest. While carriers of the CC genotype developed increased hepatic insulin resistance, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 did not influence peripheral insulin action or the rate of lipolysis before or after bed rest. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy carriers of the T-allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146 exhibit a diminished increase of insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose to compensate for insulin resistance as induced by bed rest. Reduced paracrine glucagon stimulation may contribute to the impairment of beta-cell function in the carriers TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-allele associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

20118932|t|A map of open chromatin in human pancreatic islets.
20118932|a|Tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is central to human disease. To identify regulatory DNA active in human pancreatic islets, we profiled chromatin by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements coupled with high-throughput sequencing (FAIRE-seq). We identified approximately 80,000 open chromatin sites. Comparison of FAIRE-seq data from islets to that from five non-islet cell lines revealed approximately 3,300 physically linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which typically encompassed single genes that have islet-specific expression. We mapped sequence variants to open chromatin sites and found that rs7903146, a TCF7L2 intronic variant strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, is located in islet-selective open chromatin. We found that human islet samples heterozygous for rs7903146 showed allelic imbalance in islet FAIRE signals and that the variant alters enhancer activity, indicating that genetic variation at this locus acts in cis with local chromatin and regulatory changes. These findings illuminate the tissue-specific organization of cis-regulatory elements and show that FAIRE-seq can guide the identification of regulatory variants underlying disease susceptibility.

20142250|t|Diabetes genes and prostate cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.
20142250|a|There is a known inverse association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prostate cancer (PrCa) that is poorly understood. Genetic studies of the T2D-PrCa association may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of this association. We evaluated associations in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study between PrCa and nine T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies of T2D (in CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARG, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and four T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms from pre-genome-wide association studies (in ADRB2, CAPN10, SLC2A2, and UCP2). From 1987 to 2000, there were 397 incident PrCa cases among 6,642 men ages 45 to 64 years at baseline. We used race-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between PrCa and increasing number of T2D risk-raising alleles. PrCa was positively associated with the CAPN10 rs3792267 G allele [hazard ratio (HR) 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.44] and inversely associated with the SLC2A2 rs5400 Thr110 allele (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72, 1.00), the UCP2 rs660339 Val55 allele (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73, 0.97) and the IGF2BP2 rs4402960 T allele (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; blacks only). The TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele was inversely associated with PrCa using a dominant genetic model (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Further knowledge of T2D gene-PrCa mechanisms may improve understanding of PrCa etiology.

20161779|t|Investigation of type 2 diabetes risk alleles support CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, and TCF7L2 as susceptibility genes in a Han Chinese cohort.
20161779|a|BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported several genetic variants to be reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes. Additional variants have also been detected from a metaanalysis of three GWASs, performed in populations of European ancestry. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of 17 genetic variants from 15 candidate loci, identified in type 2 diabetes GWASs and the metaanalysis, in a Han Chinese cohort. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Selected type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants were genotyped in 1,165 type 2 diabetic patients and 1,136 normoglycemic control individuals of Southern Han Chinese ancestry. The OR for risk of developing type 2 diabetes was calculated using a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Genotype-phenotype associations were tested using a multivariate linear regression model. Genetic variants in CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, TCF7L2, TCF2, MC4R, and PPARG showed a nominal association with type 2 diabetes (P<or=0.05), of whom the three first would stand correction for multiple testing: CDKN2A/B rs10811661, OR: 1.26 (1.12-1.43) P = 1.8*10(-4); CDKAL1 rs10946398, OR: 1.23 (1.09-1.39); P = 7.1*10(-4), and TCF7L2 rs7903146, OR: 1.61 (1.19-2.18) P = 2.3 * 10(-3). Only nominal phenotype associations were observed, notably for rs8050136 in FTO and fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.002), postprandial plasma glucose (P = 0.002), and fasting C-peptide levels (P = 0.006) in the diabetic patients, and with BMI in controls (P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified significant association between variants in CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1 and TCF7L2, and type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese cohort, indicating these genes as strong candidates conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes across different ethnicities.

20185807|t|Detailed physiologic characterization reveals diverse mechanisms for novel genetic Loci regulating glucose and insulin metabolism in humans.
20185807|a|OBJECTIVE Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed loci associated with glucose and insulin-related traits. We aimed to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their role in regulation of glucose control, insulin secretion and/or action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084). RESULTS The glucose-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels, but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)). Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in glucose-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and C2CD4B. Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in glucose-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin or insulin sensitivity). Two loci previously associated with fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS Genetic loci identified through their effect on hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and sensitivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed physiological characterization of such loci for improved understanding of pathways associated with alterations in glucose homeostasis and eventually type 2 diabetes.

20215779|t|Evidence of interaction between type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes and dietary fat intake for adiposity and glucose homeostasis-related phenotypes.
20215779|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of several susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes and adiposity and glucose homeostasis-related phenotypes are influenced by dietary fat intake. METHODS: Thirty-three SNPs in 9 T2DM genes (CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, HHEX, HNF1B, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, TCF7L2 and WFS1) were tested in a maximum of 669 subjects from the Quebec Family Study. Subjects were measured for several adiposity indices and underwent a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test. Total fat intake was estimated from a 3-day dietary record. RESULTS: We observed 13 significant (p < or = 0.01) SNP-dietary fat interactions. Among them, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, alone or in interaction with dietary fat intake, influenced abdominal total fat (ATF: SNP effect, p = 0.006, interaction effect, p = 0.009) and abdominal visceral fat (AVF: SNP effect, p = 0.007, interaction effect, p = 0.01). Similarly, TCF7L2 rs12573128 alone or in interaction with dietary fat intake, influenced insulin sensitivity (SNP effect and interaction effect, p < or = 0.008) and glucose tolerance (SNP effect p < or= 0.009 and interaction effect, p < or = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that gene-dietary fat interactions may influence glucose homeostasis-related phenotypes and play an important role in determining the increased risk of diabetes associated with the T2DM susceptibility genes.

20217507|t|Wnt signaling in pancreatic islets.
20217507|a|The Wnt signaling pathway is critically important not only for stem cell amplification, differentiation, and migration, but also is important for organogenesis and the development of the body plan. Beta-catenin/TCF7L2-dependent Wnt signaling (the canonical pathway) is involved in pancreas development, islet function, and insulin production and secretion. The glucoincretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 and the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 modulate canonical Wnt signaling in beta-cells which is obligatory for their mitogenic and cytoprotective actions. Genome-wide association studies have uncovered 19 gene loci that confer susceptibility for the development of type 2 diabetes. At least 14 of these diabetes risk alleles encode proteins that are implicated in islet growth and functioning. Seven of them are either components of, or known target genes for, Wnt signaling. The transcription factor TCF7L2 is particularly strongly associated with risk for diabetes and appears to be fundamentally important in both canonical Wnt signaling and beta-cell functioning. Experimental loss of TCF7L2 function in islets and polymorphisms in TCF7L2 alleles in humans impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting that perturbations in the Wnt signaling pathway may contribute substantially to the susceptibility for, and pathogenesis of, type 2 diabetes. This review focuses on considerations of the hormonal regulation of Wnt signaling in islets and implications for mutations in components of the Wnt signaling pathway as a source for risk-associated alleles for type 2 diabetes.

20299486|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism and hyperglycemia in an adult Italian population-based cohort.
20299486|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess whether TCF7L2 polymorphism has a role in the deterioration of glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Metabolic variables were evaluated at baseline and after 6-year follow-up in 1,480 Caucasian subjects from a population-based cohort. RESULTS: At baseline, T-allele carriers showed significantly lower BMI and homeostasis model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA-B) values and higher fasting glycemia and diabetes prevalence. At follow-up, fasting glucose and HOMA-B index were increased and reduced, respectively, in carriers of the T-allele. Incident impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and incident diabetes were 5.7, 10.7, 16.9% and 1.6, 1.7, 3.0% in the CC, CT, and TT genotypes, respectively. In a multiple logistic regression model, the association between incident IFG and the T-allele was significant (odds ratio [OR] 2.08 [95% CI 1.35-3.20] and 3.56 [2.11-5.98] in CT and TT genotypes, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The T-allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism was independently associated with increasing fasting glucose values toward hyperglycemia in the follow-up.

20361036|t|Gene-gene interactions lead to higher risk for development of type 2 diabetes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population.
20361036|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has accumulated that multiple genetic and environmental factors play important roles in determining susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although variants from candidate genes have become prime targets for genetic analysis, few studies have considered their interplay. Our goal was to evaluate interactions among SNPs within genes frequently identified as associated with T2D. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Logistic regression was used to study interactions among 4 SNPs, one each from HNF4A[rs1884613], TCF7L2[rs12255372], WFS1[rs10010131], and KCNJ11[rs5219] in a case-control Ashkenazi sample of 974 diabetic subjects and 896 controls. Nonparametric multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized MDR (GMDR) were used to confirm findings from the logistic regression analysis. HNF4A and WFS1 SNPs were associated with T2D in logistic regression analyses [P<0.0001, P<0.0002, respectively]. Interaction between these SNPs were also strong using parametric or nonparametric methods: the unadjusted odds of being affected with T2D was 3 times greater in subjects with the HNF4A and WFS1 risk alleles than those without either (95% CI = [1.7-5.3]; P<or=0.0001). Although the univariate association between the TCF7L2 SNP and T2D was relatively modest [P = 0.02], when paired with the HNF4A SNP, the OR for subjects with risk alleles in both SNPs was 2.4 [95% CI = 1.7-3.4; P<or=0.0001]. The KCNJ11 variant reached significance only when paired with either the HNF4A or WFSI SNPs: unadjusted ORs were 2.0 [95% CI = 1.4-2.8; P<or=0.0001] and 2.3 [95% CI = 1.2-4.4; P<or=0.0001], respectively. MDR and GMDR results were consistent with the parametric findings. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of strong independent associations between T2D and SNPs in HNF4A and WFS1 and their interaction in our Ashkenazi sample. We also observed an interaction in the nonparametric analysis between the HNF4A and KCNJ11 SNPs (P<or=0.001), demonstrating that an independently non-significant variant may interact with another variant resulting in an increased disease risk.

20424228|t|Impact of common variants of PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A, IGF2BP2, and CDKAL1 on the risk of type 2 diabetes in 5,164 Indians.
20424228|a|OBJECTIVE: Common variants in PPARG, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A, IGF2BP2, and CDKAL1 genes have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes in European populations by genome-wide association studies. We have studied the association of common variants in these eight genes with type 2 diabetes and related traits in Indians by combining the data from two independent case-control studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (PPARG-rs1801282, KCNJ11-rs5219, TCF7L2-rs7903146, SLC30A8-rs13266634, HHEX-rs1111875, CDKN2A-rs10811661, IGF2BP2-rs4402960, and CDKAL1-rs10946398) in 5,164 unrelated Indians of Indo-European ethnicity, including 2,486 type 2 diabetic patients and 2,678 ethnically matched control subjects. RESULTS: We confirmed the association of all eight loci with type 2 diabetes with odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.18 to 1.89 (P = 1.6 x 10(-3) to 4.6 x 10(-34)). The strongest association with the highest effect size was observed for TCF7L2 (OR 1.89 [95% CI 1.71-2.09], P = 4.6 x 10(-34)). We also found significant association of PPARG and TCF7L2 with homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (P = 6.9 x 10(-8) and 3 x 10(-4), respectively), which looked consistent with recessive and under-dominant models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicates the association of well-established common variants with type 2 diabetes in Indians and shows larger effect size for most of them than those reported in Europeans.

20437825|t|Relationship of five type 2 diabetes candidate gene polymorphisms to the age at diagnosis of diabetes in the Slovakian population.
20437825|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between polymorphisms of five candidate genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the age at diagnosis of T2DM. METHODS: 538 Slovakian patients with T2DM were included and their age at diagnosis of T2DM retrieved from their medical records. Polymorphisms of genes encoding peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), PPARG-coactivator-1 (PGC1), insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), the subunit Kir 6.2 of the ATP-dependent potassium-channel (KCNJ11) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) were detected by PCR-RFLP methods. RESULTS: No significant relationship between the risk alleles of the examined gene polymorphisms to the lower mean age at diagnosis of T2DM was observed. The carriers of the TT-genotype of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism had significantly increased odds ratio for diagnosis of diabetes before the age of 40 years [OR 3.02 (1.34, 6.81), p = 0.008], in comparison with the CC/CT genotype carriers. CONCLUSION: No significant association of PPARG, PGC1, IRS1, KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and the age at diagnosis of T2DM was observed in the present study. Homozygotes for the risk allele of TCF7L2 had more frequently early onset of T2DM, before age of 40 years (Tab. 4, Ref. 15).

20478041|t|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism may be associated with focal arteriolar narrowing in Caucasians with hypertension or without diabetes: the ARIC Study.
20478041|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has emerged as a consistently replicated susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes, however, whether the TCF7L2 gene also has similar effects on the retinal microvasculature is less clear. We therefore aimed to investigate the association between the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism and retinal microvascular phenotypes in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (1993-1995). METHODS: This was a population-based, cross-sectional study of 10,320 middle-aged African American (n = 2,199) and Caucasian (n = 8,121) men and women selected from four United States communities to examine the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and retinal microvascular signs (retinopathy, focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, arteriolar and venular calibers). Photographs on one randomly selected eye were graded for presence of retinal microvascular signs and used to measure retinal vessel calibres. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, study center, mean arterial blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and other covariates, few associations of TCF7L2 rs7903146 and retinal microvascular signs were noted. TCF7L2 rs7903146 T risk allele was significantly associated with focal arteriolar narrowing in Caucasians with hypertension [odds ratio (OR)CT vs. CC (95% CI) = 1.25 (1.09-1.44); ORTT vs. CC = 1.56 (1.18-2.06); P = 0.002] and in Caucasians without diabetes [OR CT vs. CC = 1.18 (1.06-1.32); OR TT vs. CC = 1.40 (1.12, 1.75); P = 0.003]. No significant association of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and retinal vascular signs was noted among African American individuals. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 is not consistently associated with retinal microvascular signs. However, we report an association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and focal arteriolar narrowing in Caucasians with hypertension or without diabetes. Further research in other large, population-based studies is needed to replicate these findings.

20485196|t|Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: prevalence and risk factors.
20485196|a|AIM/PURPOSE: Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at increased risks of impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of alterations in glucose metabolism and the predisposing factors of these disturbances in survivors of childhood ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 131 ALL survivors, an oral glucose tolerance test was conducted to determine beta-cell function/insulin sensitivity. The particular risk factors were analyzed and 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms of diabetic predisposing genes: PAX4 and TCF7L2 were genotyped to evaluate the association between these factors and beta-cell function/insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Ten out of 131 survivors (7.6%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) whereas 40 out of 131 (30.5%) had insulin resistance (IR) and showed characteristics of the metabolic syndrome (hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C). In the logistic regression analysis, the most important factor predicting IGT and IR was older age of survivors (P=0.014 and P<0.001, respectively) whereas the PAX4 R192H mutation (rs2233580) was significantly associated with IGT after adjustment for age (P=0.043) (adjusted OR 5.28, 95% CI 1.06-26.40). CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence suggests that older age is an independent risk factor for developing IGT and IR in childhood ALL survivors, emphasizing the need for life-long metabolic screening. The PAX4 variant might impact individual susceptibility against IGT and diabetes. However, an identification of underlying risk(s) is the rational for future studies.

20503258|t|Candidate gene association study conditioning on individual ancestry in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome from Mexico City.
20503258|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is influenced by diverse environmental and genetic risk factors. Metabolic syndrome (MS) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. We analysed 14 cases of polymorphisms located in 10 candidate loci, in a sample of patients with T2D and controls from Mexico City. METHODS: We analysed the association of 14 polymorphisms located within 10 genes (TCF7L2, ENPP1, ADRB3, KCNJ11, LEPR, PPARgamma, FTO, CDKAL1, SIRT1 and HHEX) with T2D and MS. The analysis included 519 subjects with T2D defined according to the ADA criteria, 389 with MS defined according to the AHA/NHLBI criteria and 547 controls. Association was tested with the program ADMIXMAP including individual ancestry, age, sex, education and in some cases body mass index (BMI), in a logistic regression model. RESULTS: The two markers located within the TCF7L2 gene showed strong associations with T2D (rs7903146, T allele, odd ratio (OR) = 1.76, p = 0.001 and rs12255372, T allele, OR = 1.78, p = 0.002), but did not show significant association with MS. The non-synonymous rs4994 polymorphism of the ADRB3 gene was associated with T2D (Trp allele, OR = 0.62, p = 0.001) and MS (Trp allele, OR = 0.74, p = 0.018). Nominally significant associations were also observed between T2D and the SIRT1 rs3758391 SNP and MS and the HHEX rs5015480 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Variants located within the gene TCF7L2 are strongly associated with T2D but not with MS, providing support to previous evidence indicating that polymorphisms at the TCF7L2 gene increase T2D risk. In contrast, the non-synonymous ADRB3 rs4994 polymorphism is associated with T2D and MS.

20540670|t|Gestational diabetes mellitus shares polymorphisms of genes associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in the Greek population.
20540670|a|Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) share common pathophysiological features, including b-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated the association between GDM and five recently identified T2D susceptibility loci, in a Greek population. We studied 148 women with GDM and 107 non-diabetic unrelated pregnant Greek women, for polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene (rs7903146 C/T), the PPARG gene (Pro12Ala), the KCNJ11 gene (E23K), the IRS1 gene (G972R) and in the FOXC2 gene (-512C>T). The T-allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM [p = 0.0003; odds ratio (OR) 2.04 (95%CI 1.38-3.00)]. Additionally, CT and TT genotypes were significantly overrepresented in women with GDM compared to controls (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0148, respectively). Analysis of the IRS1 G972R polymorphism showed that the R-allele frequency was increased in women with GDM [(p = 0.009; OR 1.67 (95%CI 1.14-2.47)]. The genotypes and allele frequencies of the other polymorphisms studied did not statistically differ between the GDM and the control women. Thus, our data suggest that the common T2D susceptibility polymorphism of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 C/T) gene, and the G972R polymorphism of the IRS1 gene, seem to predispose to GDM in Greek women.

20546291|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene variants with low GAD autoantibody titre in LADA subjects (NIRAD Study 5).
20546291|a|AIMS: We previously demonstrated the presence of two different populations among adult-onset autoimmune diabetes (latent autoimmume diabetes of adults; LADA) having high or low titre of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA). The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been recognized as the major gene associated with Type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the phenotypic heterogeneity of LADA based on GADA titre is associated with TCF7L2 polymorphisms. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty patients identified as LADA, divided into two subgroups with low (< or = 32 arbitrary units) or high (> 32 units) GADA titre, 620 subjects with Type 2 diabetes [from the Non-Insulin Requiring Autoimmune Diabetes (NIRAD) study cohort of 5330 subjects] in addition to 551 consecutive cases of Type 1 diabetes and 545 normoglycaemic subjects were analysed for the rs12255372 and rs7903146 polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene using Taqman. RESULTS: The genotype and allele distributions of the two polymorphisms revealed similar frequencies in subjects with low GADA titre and Type 2 diabetes. High GADA titre, Type 1 diabetes and controls also showed comparable frequencies. A significant increase of GT/TT genotypes of the rs12255372 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and CT/TT genotypes of the rs7903146 SNP was observed in low GADA titre and Type 2 diabetes compared with high GADA titre, Type 1 diabetes and controls (P < or = 0.04 for both comparisons). The risk alleles of both variants were increased in low GADA titre and Type 2 diabetes compared with high GADA titre, Type 1 diabetes and control subjects (P < 0.02 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 common genetic variants of susceptibility are associated only with low GADA antibody titre in LADA patients.

20548773|t|Type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene expression in normal or diabetic sorted human alpha and beta cells: correlations with age or BMI of islet donors.
20548773|a|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility genes for development of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine whether a subset of these (comprising FTO, IDE, KCNJ11, PPARG and TCF7L2) were transcriptionally restricted to or enriched in human beta cells by sorting islet cells into alpha and beta - specific fractions. We also aimed to correlate expression of these transcripts in both alpha and beta cell types with phenotypic traits of the islet donors and to compare diabetic and non-diabetic cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Islet cells were sorted using a previously published method and RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed and used as the template for quantitative PCR. Sorted cells were also analysed for insulin and glucagon immunostaining and insulin secretion from the beta cells as well as insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 content. All five genes were expressed in both alpha and beta cells, with significant enrichment of KCNJ11 in the beta cells and of TCF7L2 in the alpha cells. The ratio of KCNJ11 in beta to alpha cells was negatively correlated with BMI, while KCNJ11 expression in alpha cells was negatively correlated with age but not associated with BMI. Beta cell expression of glucagon, TCF7L2 and IDE was increased in cells from islets that had spent more time in culture prior to cell sorting. In beta cells, KCNJ11, FTO and insulin were positively correlated with each other. Diabetic alpha and beta cells had decreased expression of insulin, glucagon and FTO. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study has identified novel patterns of expression of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes within sorted islet cells and suggested interactions of gene expression with age or BMI of the islet donors. However, expression of these genes in islets is less associated with BMI than has been found for other tissues.

20550665|t|Association study of genetic variants in eight genes/loci with type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese population.
20550665|a|BACKGROUND: At least twenty genes/loci were shown to be associated with type 2diabetes in European original populations. Five of these genes were shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese populations. The purpose of this study was to replicate the association of genetic vairants in the eight diabetes-related genes/loci with type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese cohort from western part of China. Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the eight genes/loci including TCF7L2, HHEX, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, PPARG, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, and CDKN2A/CDKN2B were genotyped in 1,529 cases and 1,439 controls in a Han Chinese population using the ABI SNaPshot method. The meta-analysis of the association between rs7903146 in TCF7L2 gene and T2D in the Han Chinese was performed. RESULTS: Among the eight genes/loci examined, we found that four were significantly associated with T2D. Although previous studies showed that the association between the SNP rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene and T2D was controversial within the Han Chinese population, we have confirmed the significant association between the SNP rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene and T2D in both this study and the meta-analysis in the population. In addition, we also confirmed that three SNPs (rs1111875, rs7923837 and rs5015480) in HHEX , one SNP (rs10946398) in CDKAL1, and three SNPs (rs13266634, rs3802177 and rs11558471) in SLC30A8 were significantly associated with T2D in the population being studied. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the variants in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, and SLC30A8 genes are associated with T2D in a Han Chinese population.

20578204|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism and context-specific risk of impaired fasting glucose in African American and Caucasian adults: the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study.
20578204|a|BACKGROUND: Although variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are consistently associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in Caucasians, data from large population-based studies of African Americans are lacking. Moreover, few studies have investigated the effects of TCF7L2 on IFG in the context of metabolic risk factors for diabetes. METHODS: We investigated the association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and incident IFG defined as fasting serum glucose levels of 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) in 1377 African American and 5152 Caucasian participants without diabetes and IFG at intake who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study from 1987 to 1989 and were followed for 9 years. RESULTS: Incident IFG was identified in 810 (58.8%) African American and 2652 (51.5%) Caucasian participants. Compared to homozygous CC Caucasian individuals, heterozygous CT [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.09 (95% CI = 1.03-1.15)] and homozygous TT [1.18 (1.05-1.33)] individuals had significantly higher risk of developing IFG over 9-year follow-up. The association between rs7903146 and IFG risk was stronger in Caucasians with obesity [HR(CTvs.CC) = 1.28 (1.12, 1.47); HR(TTvs.CC) = 1.65 (1.25, 2.17)] or high triglycerides [HR(CTvs.CC) = 1.31(1.10, 1.56); HR(TTvs.CC) = 1.72 (1.21, 2.43)]. No association of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and incident IFG was noted in African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Our study replicates the association between rs7903146 and IFG risk in a population-based, longitudinal cohort of Caucasians but not in African Americans. For the first time, our study provides evidence for interactions between TCF7L2 and metabolic risk factors on the occurrence of IFG in Caucasians.

20597906|t|A validation study of type 2 diabetes-related variants of the TCF7L2, HHEX, KCNJ11, and ADIPOQ genes in one endogamous ethnic group of north India.
20597906|a|The aim of this study was to validate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of four candidate genes (TCF7L2, HHEX, KCNJ11, and ADIPOQ) related to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an endogamous population of north India; the Aggarwal population, having 18-clans. This endogamous population model was heavily supported by recent land mark work and we also verified the homogeneity of this population by clan-based stratification analysis. Two SNPs (rs4506565; rs7903146) in TCF7L2 were found to be significant (p-value = 0.00191; p-value = 0.00179, respectively), and odds ratios of 2.1 (dominant-model) and 2.0 (recessive-model) respectively, were obtained for this population. The TTT haplotype in the TCF7L2 gene was significantly associated with T2D. Waist-Hip ratio (WHR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and age were significant covariates for increasing risk of T2D. Single-SNP, combined-SNPs and haplotype analysis provides clear evidence that the causal mutation is near to or within the significant haplotype (TTT) of the TCF7L2 gene. In spite of a culturally-learned sedentary lifestyle and fat-enriched dietary habits, WHR rather than body-mass-index emerged as a robust predictor of risk for T2D in this population.

20616309|t|Coronary artery calcification and its relationship to validated genetic variants for diabetes mellitus assessed in the Heinz Nixdorf recall cohort.
20616309|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between genomewide association study-based diabetes mellitus-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), a valid risk factor for coronary heart disease, in a large, unselected, population-based cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped 11 validated genomewide association study-based diabetes SNPs in 4459 participants of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. We applied generalized linear regression models to explore the impact of the diabetes SNPs on CAC and to jointly model the effect of the SNPs and CAC on diabetes status. We observed a significant association between cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/2B (CDKN2A/2B) variant rs564398 and quantitative CAC (P=1.81 x 10(-5) and adjusted P=4.02 x 10(-4); odds ratio for the presence of CAC, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25]). Moreover, we observed no strong impact of CAC on diabetes risk in the presence of the other genetic variants. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a genetic variant near CDKN2A/2B that has been reported to be strongly associated with diabetes is strongly associated with CAC. In contrast, variants near insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1), solute carreir family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 (SLC30A8), hematopoietically-expressed homeobox (HHEX), and transcription factor 7-like2 (TCF7L2) were clearly associated with diabetes; no evidence for an association to CAC was observable. This differential association pattern underlines the potential of endophenotypes, such as CAC, to extend the scope of disease outcome associations.

20640398|t|Disease-associated loci are significantly over-represented among genes bound by transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) in vivo.
20640398|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been strongly implicated in type 2 diabetes and cancer. Our goal was to identify the DNA sequences bound by this transcription factor in vivo. METHODS: We applied chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to globally identify and map human DNA sequences bound by TCF7L2 in the colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116, where it is abundantly expressed. RESULTS: We identified 1,095 discrete binding sites across the genome, of which a subset were within 5 kb of 548 annotated NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) genes. Despite using a cancer cell line, the most significant functions represented using pathway analysis software were related to diabetes, genetic disorders and coronary artery disease. As one of the enriched categories was related to genetic disorders, we queried our results against all published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and found a highly significant over-representation of reported loci from among the genes bound by TCF7L2 within 5 kb (p   =   7.50   *   10        ). This observation was primarily driven by excess loci revealed from GWAS of metabolic and cardiovascular traits; however, there was no or only minor enrichment of GWAS-derived loci for cancer, and inflammatory or neurological diseases. Of the specific traits, the most enriched loci were for type 2 diabetes and height. When defining the distance from genes at 50 kb or 500 kb, this enrichment pattern persisted, with some additional evidence for enrichment of cancer-related loci. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A highly significant proportion of genes bound by TCF7L2 are known disease-associated loci. These findings suggest that TCF7L2 is a central node in the regulation of human diabetes and other disease-associated genes.

20648057|t|Potential role of TCF7L2 gene variants on cardiac sympathetic/parasympathetic activity.
20648057|a|Variants in transcription factor 7-like 2 (266096218TCF7L2266096218USuser266096218Gene names have been italicized per house style. Please check and confirm whether there are other instances that need to be italicized or instances where italics have been inappropriately applied.) gene have been found strongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as with an impairment of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) signalling chain. In rats, stimulation of central GLP-1 receptors increases heart rate and activates autonomic regulatory neurons. We aimed to evaluate the potential role of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms on sympathovagal response in relation to changes in plasma insulin and/or GLP-1 concentration after glucose ingestion. Genotyping was performed for rs12255372 and rs7903146 TCF7L2 gene variants in 250 non-related healthy volunteers (mean age 27  3 years). Consistent with previous reports, both single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D'=0.87, r(2)=0.76). A subset of 167 patients underwent an oral glucose tolerance test while a continuous recording of heart rate variability was performed. At baseline, no differences in fasting plasma insulin, in GLP-1 levels and in LF/HF (low frequency/high frequency) ratio between the three genotypes were found. Along with glucose ingestion TT subjects had lower INS(AUC) (insulin area under curve), as well as higher LF/HF(AUC) (LF/HF area under curve) values. No difference in GLP-1(AUC) (GLP-1 area under curve) between TCF7L2 gene variants was found. A multivariate analysis including multiple covariates showed that only INS(AUC,) GLP-1(AUC) and TCF7L2 gene variants were independently associated with LF/HF(AUC). In conclusion, TT genotype of rs12255372 and rs7903146 TCF7L2 gene variants is associated with lower insulin secretion and higher cardiosympathetic activity. Moreover, such effect is independent of GLP-1 and insulin plasma concentrations suggesting a potential role of such gene variants in increasing cardiovascular risk through enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity.

20675304|t|Insulin treatment and high-fat diet feeding reduces the expression of three Tcf genes in rodent pancreas.
20675304|a|Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in intronic regions of human TCF7L2 are associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Whether Tcf7l2 is expressed in pancreatic islets of rodent species at a considerable level, however, remains controversial. We used RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR to examine Tcf7l2 expression in rodent gut, pancreas, isolated pancreatic islets, and cultured cell lines. The expression level of Tcf7l2 was relatively lower in the pancreas compared to the gut or the pancreatic b-cell line Ins-1. Immunostaining did not detect a Tcf7l2 signal in mouse pancreatic islets. Endogenous canonical Wnt activity was not appreciable in the pancreas of TOPGAL transgenic mice. Both Tcf7 and Tcf7l1, but not Lef1, were expressed in the pancreas. The expression of the three Tcf genes (Tcf7, Tcf7l1, and Tcf7l2) in the pancreas was reduced by treatment with insulin or high-fat diet feeding, in contrast to the stimulation of Tcf7l2 expression by insulin in the gut. We suggest that hyperinsulinemia represses Tcf gene expression in the pancreas. Whether and how this reduction alters the function of pancreatic b cells during hyperinsulinemia deserves further investigation.

20682688|t|Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study: common genetic variants in GCK and TCF7L2 are associated with fasting and postchallenge glucose levels in pregnancy and with the new consensus definition of gestational diabetes mellitus from the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups.
20682688|a|OBJECTIVE: Common genetic variants in GCK and TCF7L2 are associated with higher fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant populations. However, their associations with glucose levels from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in pregnancy have not been assessed in a large sample. We hypothesized that these variants are associated with quantitative measures of glycemia in pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the associations between variants rs1799884 (GCK) and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) and OGTT outcomes at 24-32 weeks' gestation in 3,811 mothers of European (U.K. and Australia) and 1,706 mothers of Asian (Thailand) ancestry from the HAPO cohort. We also tested associations with offspring birth anthropometrics. RESULTS: The maternal GCK variant was associated with higher fasting glucose in Europeans (P = 0.001) and Thais (P < 0.0001), 1-h glucose in Europeans (P = 0.001), and 2-h glucose in Thais (P = 0.005). It was also associated with higher European offspring birth weight, fat mass, and skinfold thicknesses (P < 0.05). The TCF7L2 variant was associated with all three maternal glucose outcomes (P = 0.03, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001 for fasting and 1-h and 2-h glucose, respectively) in the Europeans but not in the Thais (P > 0.05). In both populations, both variants were associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus according to the new International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommendations (P = 0.001-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GCK and TCF7L2 variants are associated with glucose levels known to carry an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in women without overt diabetes. Further studies will be important to determine the variance in maternal glucose explained by all known genetic variants.

20703447|t|Expression analysis of loci associated with type 2 diabetes in human tissues.
20703447|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genetic mapping has identified over 20 loci contributing to genetic risk of type 2 diabetes. The next step is to identify the genes and mechanisms regulating the contributions of genetic risk to disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of age, height, weight and risk alleles on expression of candidate genes in diabetes-associated regions in three relevant human tissues. METHODS: We measured transcript abundance for WFS1, KCNJ11, TCF2 (also known as HNF1B), PPARG, HHEX, IDE, CDKAL1, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 by quantitative RT-PCR in human pancreas (n   =   50), colon (n   =   195) and liver (n   =   50). Tissue samples were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes. The effects of age, height, weight, tissue and SNP on RNA expression were tested by linear modelling. RESULTS: Expression of all genes exhibited tissue bias. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the findings for HHEX, IDE and SLC30A8, which showed strongest tissue-specific mRNA expression bias. Neither age, height nor weight were associated with gene expression. We found no evidence that type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs affect neighbouring gene expression (cis-expression quantitative trait loci) in colon, pancreas and liver. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides new evidence that tissue-type, but not age, height, weight or SNPs in or near candidate genes associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes are strong contributors to differential gene expression in the genes and tissues examined.

20798759|t|Role of BMI in the Association of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 Variant with Coronary Heart Disease: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.
20798759|a|We examined the association of variation in the type 2 diabetes risk-conferring TCF7L2 gene with the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) among the lean, overweight, and obese members of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed using a general model, with the major homozygote as the reference category. For 9,865 whites, a significant increase in the risk of CHD was seen only among lean ( BMI < 25 kg/m(2)) individuals homozygous for the T allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 gene risk variant (hazard ratio 1.42; 95% CI 1.03,1.97; P = .01). No association was found among 3,631 blacks, regardless of BMI status. An attenuated hazard ratio was observed among the nondiabetic ARIC cohort members. This study suggests that body mass modifies the association of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele with CHD risk.

20800300|t|Revision of the ADA-classification of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2): the importance of maturity onset diabetes (MOD), and senile diabetes (DS).
20800300|a|The changing social and economic conditions and the increase of the life span induced a progressive increase of the general prevalence of DMT2, particularly in the elderly population of the highly evoluted countries. Up to now 18 genetic loci have been identified, each of them consisting of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The evidence that the DMT2 is regulated by a high number of genes, demonstrate the pathogenetic complexity of this disease. The onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) in medium age is a consequence of the breakdown of the glycemic homeostasis in correlation with the genetic factors, such as the variants of the TCF7L2, obesity, etc., and the environmental factors, such as the life-style, the evolution of chronic-degenerative diseases, etc. In case of DM that onsets in old age we have to add the deterioration of the anti-aging defense mechanisms, characterized by the antagonistic action of the genes of longevity and aging. One can observe several clinical and therapeutic differences; therefore, the authors of this review propose the reinsertion of three forms into the DMT2 correlated with the age of onset and with the actual age of the subjects: the maturity onset diabetes (MOD), the maturity onset diabetes in elderly (MODE), and the senile diabetes (DS).

20802253|t|Glycemia determines the effect of type 2 diabetes risk genes on insulin secretion.
20802253|a|OBJECTIVE: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in diabetes risk genes reduce glucose- and/or incretin-induced insulin secretion. Here, we investigated interactions between glycemia and such diabetes risk polymorphisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin secretion was assessed by insulinogenic index and areas under the curve of C-peptide/glucose in 1,576 subjects using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Participants were genotyped for 10 diabetes risk SNPs associated with b-cell dysfunction: rs5215 (KCNJ11), rs13266634 (SLC30A8), rs7754840 (CDKAL1), rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs10010131 (WFS1), rs7923837 (HHEX), rs151290 (KCNQ1), and rs4402960 (IGF2BP2). Furthermore, the impact of the interaction between genetic variation in TCF7L2 and glycemia on changes in insulin secretion was tested in 315 individuals taking part in a lifestyle intervention study. RESULTS: For the SNPs in TCF7L2 and WFS1, we found a significant interaction between glucose control and insulin secretion (all P  <= 0.0018 for glucose   genotype). When plotting insulin secretion against glucose at 120 min OGTT, the compromising SNP effects on insulin secretion are most apparent under high glucose. In the longitudinal study, rs7903146 in TCF7L2 showed a significant interaction with baseline glucose tolerance upon change in insulin secretion (P = 0.0027). Increased glucose levels at baseline predicted an increase in insulin secretion upon improvement of glycemia by lifestyle intervention only in carriers of the risk alleles. CONCLUSIONS: For the diabetes risk genes TCF7L2 and WFS1, which are associated with impaired incretin signaling, the level of glycemia determines SNP effects on insulin secretion. This indicates the increasing relevance of these SNPs during the progression of prediabetes stages toward clinically overt type 2 diabetes.

20803090|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) regulates activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1 pathway for development of diabetic nephropathy.
20803090|a|Smad1 has previously been shown to play a key role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN), by increasing synthesis of extracellular matrix. However, the regulatory mechanism of Smad1 in DN is still unclear. This study aims to elucidate molecular interactions between activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1)/Smad1 signaling pathway and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) in the progression of DN in vitro and in vivo. The expressions of TCF7L2 and ALK1 were induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in parallel with Smad1, phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) through TGF-b1 in cultured mesangial cells. Constitutively active ALK1 increased pSmad1 and a-SMA expressions. The binding of TCF7L2 to ALK1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, TCF7L2 induced promoter activity of ALK1. AGEs and TGF-b1 induced a marked increase in TCF7L2 expression in parallel with ALK1. Overexpression of TCF7L2 increased the expressions of ALK1 and Smad1. Inversely, TCF7L2 knockdown by siRNA suppressed a-SMA expression as well as ALK1 and Smad1. The iNOS transgenic mice (iNOS-Tgm), which developed diabetic glomerulosclerosis resembling human diabetic nephropathy, exhibited markedly increased expressions of ALK1, TCF7L2, Smad1, pSmad1, and a-SMA in glomeruli in association with mesangial matrix expansion. These results provide a new evidence that the TCF7L2/ALK1/Smad1 pathway plays a key role in the development of DN.

20849430|t|The TCF7L2 diabetes risk variant is associated with HbA   (C) levels: a genome-wide association meta-analysis.
20849430|a|Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified around 20 common genetic variants influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Likewise, a number of variants have been associated with diabetes-related quantitative glycaemic traits, but to date the overlap between these genes and variants has been low. The majority of genetic studies have focused on fasting plasma glucose levels; however, this measure is highly variable. We have conducted a GWA meta-analysis of glycated haemoglobin (HbA   (C) ) levels within three healthy nondiabetic populations. This phenotype provides an estimate of mean glucose levels over 2-3 months and is a more stable predictor of future diabetes risk. Participants were from three isolated populations: the Orkney Isles in the north of Scotland, the Dalmatian islands of Vis, and Kor  ula in Croatia (total of 1782 nondiabetic subjects). Association was tested in each population and results combined by meta-analysis. The strongest association was with the TCF7L2 gene (rs7903146, P= 1.48 * 10      ). This is also the strongest common genetic risk factor for T2D but it has not been identified in previous genome-wide studies of glycated haemoglobin.

20873210|t|[Polymorphic markers TCF7L2 rs12255372 and SLC30A8 rs13266634 confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in a Russian population].
20873210|a|Genes 7CF7L2 and SLC30A8, encoding transcription factor-4 and transmembrane zinc transporter-8, respectively, play an important role in the regulation of development, proliferation, and pancreatic beta cell function. In the present study we examined polymorphic markers of genes rs12255372 [NT_03359.12:g33557428G --> T] of 7CF7L2 gene and rs13266634 [NP_776250.2:p.R325W] of SLC30A8 in groups of Russians with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 588) and healthy normoglycemic controles (n = 597). Significant association of allele T(rs12255372) and allele R (rs13266634) with a higher risk of T2D development has been found (OR = 1.37 and 1.22, respectively). Adjustment for the effect of potential nongenetic risk factors resulted in a further increase in the OR values, from 1.54 (P = 0.24) to 1.89 (P = 0.046) for homozygous carriers of the T allele and from 1.29 (P = 0.035) to 1.35 (P = 0.019) in the individuals homozygous for the R allele. The patients homozygous for predisposing allele T (rs12255372) or R (rs13266634) had significantly lower insulin concentrations in the blood 2 h after glucose tolerance test (GTT) as well as lower values of HOMA-beta, beta cell homeostasis indicator compared to the carriers of other genotypes. Thus, we have shown that the rs12255372 and rs13266634 markers are independent genetic T2D risk factors in a Russian population.

20878272|t|From genetic association to molecular mechanism.
20878272|a|Over the past 3  years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of confirmed type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci, most arising through the implementation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, progress toward the understanding of disease mechanisms has been slowed by modest effect sizes and the fact that most GWAS signals map away from coding sequence: the presumption is that their effects are mediated through regulation of nearby transcripts, but the identities of the genes concerned are often far from clear. In this review we describe the progress that has been made to date in translating association signals into molecular mechanisms with a focus on the most tractable signals (eg, KCNJ11/ABCC8, SLC30A8, GCKR) and those in which human, animal, and cellular models (FTO, TCF7L2, G6PC2) have provided insights into the role in T2D pathogenesis. Finally, the challenges for the field with the advent of genome-scale next-generation resequencing efforts are discussed.

20878273|t|Molecular function of TCF7L2: Consequences of TCF7L2 splicing for molecular function and risk for type 2 diabetes.
20878273|a|TCF7L2 harbors the variant with the strongest effect on type 2 diabetes (T2D) identified to date, yet the molecular mechanism as to how variation in the gene increases the risk for developing T2D remains elusive. The phenotypic changes associated with the risk genotype suggest that T2D arises as a consequence of reduced islet mass and/or impaired function, and it has become clear that TCF7L2 plays an important role for several vital functions in the pancreatic islet. TCF7L2 comprises 17 exons, five of which are alternative (ie, exons 4 and 13-16). In pancreatic islets four splice variants of TCF7L2 are predominantly expressed. The regulation of these variants and the functional consequences at the protein level are still poorly understood. A clear picture of the molecular mechanism will be necessary to understand how an intronic variation in TCF7L2 can influence islet function.

20923526|t|Ethnic difference in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in inter-East Asian populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on gene polymorphism.
20923526|a|BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the fasting serum insulin level was significantly lower in Japanese patients than in Korean and Chinese patients, and showed evidence that a difference in the dietary component would be one of the most influential factors for the ethnic difference. However, it is well known that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental risk factors. Therefore, we investigated ethnic differences by focusing on gene polymorphism, possibly related to T2DM in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese subjects. METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE between January 2001 and October 2008. We conducted a search for articles containing minor allele frequency (MAF) in the gene polymorphisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPARG), inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 (KCNJ11), Calpain 10 (CAPN10), and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2). The pooled odds ratio was calculated by using a fixed-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method after confirming statistical evidence of homogeneity across the ethnicities using the Breslow-Day test. RESULTS: The Breslow-Day test revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between ethnicities in pooled odds ratios for the gene polymorphisms in PPARG (P = 0.828), KCNJ11 (P = 0.194), CAPN10 (P = 0.090), and TCF7L2 (P = 0.376). Also, pooled odds ratios of each gene polymorphism in East Asians were 0.645 for PPARG (P = 0.000), 1.168 for KCNJ11 (P = 0.000), 0.967 for CAPN10 (P = 0.759), and 1.386 for TCF7L2 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study and our previous studies suggest that behavioral and environmental risk factors have a more significant impact on ethnic difference in East Asian patients with T2DM compared with genetic predispositions.

20929593|t|The longitudinal association of common susceptibility variants for type 2 diabetes and obesity with fasting glucose level and BMI.
20929593|a|BACKGROUND: Variation in the effects of genetic variants on physiological traits over time or with age may alter the trajectories of these traits. However, few studies have investigated this possibility for variants associated with type 2 diabetes or obesity, and these show little consensus. We aimed to characterise the possible longitudinal associations of common diabetes-susceptibility variants in the KCNJ11, PPARG, TCF7L2, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8 and HHEX gene loci, with fasting glucose level; and of an obesity-associated variant in the FTO gene, with body mass index (BMI). METHODS: The study analysed data from the Busselton Health Study (n = 4,554). Cross-sectional association analyses included family data and used the total association test. Longitudinal association analyses of unrelated participant data (n = 2,864) used linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, we observed associations of the T allele at the IGF2BP2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4402960 with raised fasting glucose (p = 0.045), and the A allele at the FTO SNP rs9939609 with raised BMI (p = 0.003). Longitudinal analyses showed no significant associations between SNPs and changes in fasting glucose or BMI in the same individuals, either over mean follow-up times of 18.7 and 21.8 years respectively, or with age during adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: There was no indication that the effects of common type 2 diabetes variants on fasting glucose varied with age during adulthood or over time.

20957343|t|Carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 TT genotype have elevated levels of plasma glucose, serum proinsulin and plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) during a meal test.
20957343|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 T allele associates with type 2 diabetes in several populations, possibly mediated via decreased incretin secretion and/or action and altered beta and alpha cell function. We aimed to study circulating levels of glucose, proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) among individuals carrying the high-risk rs7903146 TT genotype and low-risk CC genotype following a meal test. METHODS: A meal challenge was performed in 31 glucose-tolerant men (age 54        7 years and BMI 26        3 kg/m  ) with rs7903146 TT genotype and 31 glucose-tolerant age- and BMI-matched men with CC genotype (age 53        6 years and BMI 26        3 kg/m  ). Serum proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide and plasma glucose, glucagon, GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP were obtained 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min after ingestion of a standardised breakfast meal. RESULTS: An elevated incremental AUC for plasma glucose was observed among TT genotype carriers (CC carriers 21.8        101.9 mmol/l   *   min vs TT carriers 97.9        89.2 mmol/l   *   min, p   =   0.001). TT carriers also had increased AUCs for proinsulin (CC carriers 6,030        3,001 pmol/l   *   min vs TT carriers 6,917        4,820 pmol/l   *   min, p   =   0.03), C-peptide (CC carriers 397.6        131.9 nmol/l   *   min vs TT carriers 417.1        109.3 nmol/l   *   min, p   =   0.04) and GIP (CC carriers 12,310        3,840 pmol/l   *   min vs TT carriers 14,590        5,910 pmol/l   *   min, p   =   0.004). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Middle-aged normoglycaemic individuals carrying the rs7903146 TCF7L2 risk TT genotype show early signs of dysregulated glucose metabolism, decreased processing of proinsulin and elevated GIP secretion following a meal challenge.

22445113|t|The Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha ( HNF1A) gene is associated with fatness and loin muscle area in the pig.
22445113|a|The significance of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) in b-cell development and function has been generally recognized in humans, as evidenced by their associations with cases of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Common Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A), Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF1B) and Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4A) mutations could lead to monogenic forms 3, 5 and 1 of diabetes mellitus, respectively, and were characterized by MODY in humans. In this study, multiple variants were discovered in the porcine HNF1A and HNF4A genes, and one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in the HNF1B gene. Using the Iowa State University Berkshire   Yorkshire pig resource population, the HNF1A, HNF1B and HNF4A genes were mapped on chromosomes 14, 12 and 17, respectively. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses indicated that most of the HNF1A variants were not in strong LD with each other; however, nearly all of them were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with loin muscle area (LMA). The SNPs c.327-19G>T and c.1768+40_23del were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with backfat and total lipid percentage, and the latter was also associated with muscle glycogen metabolism measures. Four major haplotypes were observed and the association analyses suggested that haplotype 3 (-CGCGD-, I indicates Insertion and D indicates Deletion) was favorable for reduced backfat, while haplotype 1 (-CACGI-) was unfavorably associated with backfat and LMA. There was no significant interaction effect on backfat among the SNPs c.327-19G>T, c.1768+40_23del of the HNF1A gene and c.646C>T of the transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene. These findings suggest that the HNF1A gene has significant effects on both fatness- and meat production-related traits. No significant associations with production traits with the SNPs from the HNF1B and HNF4A genes were observed in the study.

20967696|t|Metagenomic study of single-nucleotide polymorphism within candidate genes associated with type 2 diabetes in an Indian population.
20967696|a|A population-based study was undertaken to evaluate linkage between single-nucleotide polymorphisms known as risk factors and type 2 diabetes in an Indian population. The study population was comprised of 40 normal glucose-tolerant individuals (21 males and 19 females) and 40 type 2 diabetes patients (21 males and 19 females). The genes and their corresponding single-nucleotide polymorphisms that we screened were VDR (rs 731236 and rs 1544410), IL-6 (rs 1800795), TCF7L2 (rs 7903146) and TNF-a (rs 1800629). The risk alleles were more frequent in the subjects with type 2 diabetes, except for the TNF-a gene, which was very infrequent in the population; the normal allele occurred at high and similar frequencies in both normal and diabetic individuals.

20980453|t|Resequencing and analysis of variation in the TCF7L2 gene in African Americans suggests that SNP rs7903146 is the causal diabetes susceptibility variant.
20980453|a|OBJECTIVE: Variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) locus is associated with type 2 diabetes across multiple ethnicities. The aim of this study was to elucidate which variant in TCF7L2 confers diabetes susceptibility in African Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Through the evaluation of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), type 2 diabetes susceptibility was limited to a 4.3-kb interval, which contains the YRI (African) linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing rs7903146. To better define the relationship between type 2 diabetes risk and genetic variation we resequenced this 4.3-kb region in 96 African American DNAs. Thirty-three novel and 13 known SNPs were identified: 20 with minor allele frequencies (MAF) >0.05 and 12 with MAF >0.10. These polymorphisms and the previously identified DG10S478 microsatellite were evaluated in African American type 2 diabetic cases (n = 1,033) and controls (n = 1,106). RESULTS: Variants identified from direct sequencing and databases were genotyped or imputed. Fifteen SNPs showed association with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05) with rs7903146 being the most significant (P = 6.32   10(-6)). Results of imputation, haplotype, and conditional analysis of SNPs were consistent with rs7903146 being the trait-defining SNP. Analysis of the DG10S478 microsatellite, which is outside the 4.3-kb LD block, revealed consistent association of risk allele 8 with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33; P = 0.022) as reported in European populations; however, allele 16 (MAF = 0.016 cases and 0.032 controls) was strongly associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.39; P = 5.02   10(-5)) in contrast with previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: In African Americans, these observations suggest that rs7903146 is the trait-defining polymorphism associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Collectively, these results support ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes associations.

21103350|t|Variants from GIPR, TCF7L2, DGKB, MADD, CRY2, GLIS3, PROX1, SLC30A8 and IGF1 are associated with glucose metabolism in the Chinese.
21103350|a|BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in European descent samples identified novel loci influencing glucose and insulin related traits. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between these loci and traits related to glucose metabolism in the Chinese. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We genotyped seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from fifteen loci including GIPR, ADCY5, TCF7L2, VPS13C, DGKB, MADD, ADRA2A, FADS1, CRY2, SLC2A2, GLIS3, PROX1, C2CD4B, SLC30A8 and IGF1 in 6,822 Shanghai Chinese Hans comprising 3,410 type 2 diabetic patients and 3,412 normal glucose regulation subjects. MADD rs7944584 showed strong association to type 2 diabetes (p=3.5 10(-6), empirical p=0.0002) which was not observed in the European descent populations. SNPs from GIPR, TCF7L2, CRY2, GLIS3 and SLC30A8 were also associated with type 2 diabetes (p=0.0487   2.0 10(-8)). Further adjusting age, gender and BMI as confounders found PROX1 rs340874 was associated with type 2 diabetes (p=0.0391). SNPs from DGKB, MADD and SLC30A8 were associated with fasting glucose while PROX1 rs340874 was significantly associated with OGTT 2-h glucose (p=0.0392   0.0014, adjusted for age, gender and BMI), the glucose-raising allele also showed association to lower insulin secretion. IGF1 rs35767 showed significant association to both fasting and 2-h insulin levels as well as insulin secretion and sensitivity indices (p=0.0160   0.0035, adjusted for age, gender and BMI). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicated that SNPs from GIPR, TCF7L2, DGKB, MADD, CRY2, GLIS3, PROX1, SLC30A8 and IGF1 were associated with traits related to glucose metabolism in the Chinese population.

21109996|t|Association testing of TCF7L2 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes in multi-ethnic youth.
21109996|a|AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Common variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. However, it is not known whether TCF7L2 variation increases the risk of early onset type 2 diabetes. Using a case-control design, we examined whether the reported variants [rs12255372 (T/G) and rs7903146 (T/C)] are associated with type 2 diabetes in SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study participants. METHODS: Variants were genotyped in 694 non-Hispanic white (NHW) youth (86 cases, mean age 15.5  years, mean BMI 34.8; and 608 controls, mean age 14.4  years, mean BMI 22.3) and 545 African-American (AA) youth (154 cases, mean age 15.9, mean BMI 37; and 391 controls, mean age 14.8, mean BMI 23.8). Logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, BMI and West African ancestry. RESULTS: The association of the risk T allele with case/control status was different in AA and NHW youth (p   =   0.025). Among AA youth, each copy of the T allele (rs7903146) was associated with a 1.97-fold (1.37, 2.82) increased odds for type 2 diabetes (p   <   0.0001), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and African ancestry. No significant association was detected in NHW youth (adjusted OR, 1.14; 0.73, 1.79). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 variation is associated with an increased risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes among AA youth, and the association appears to be stronger in AA than NHW youth. This suggests potential different contributions of genetic and environmental factors to early-onset type 2 diabetes by race.

21114608|t|Effect of sulphonylurea treatment on glycaemic control is related to TCF7L2 genotype in patients with type 2 diabetes.
21114608|a|The aim of the present study was to analyse effects of sulphonylurea treatment on parameters of glycaemic control in relation to transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) genotypes. In 87 patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to achieve glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, effects of 6-month sulphonylurea in addition to metformin on reductions in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were evaluated. Reduction in HbA1c and FPG in response to 6-month sulphonylurea treatment was significantly higher in patients with CC genotype compared to those with the CT+TT genotype (1.16    0.07 vs. 0.86    0.07%, p = 0.003; 1.57    0.12 vs. 1.14    0.14 mmol/l, p = 0.031, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, baseline HbA1c and the TCF7L2 genotype were the only significant predictors of HbA1c reduction. In conclusion, the magnitude of HbA1c and FPG reductions after 6-month sulphonylurea treatment in addition to metformin is related to the TCF7L2 gene polymorphism.

21115178|t|Pleiotropic effects of TCF7L2 gene variants and its modulation in the metabolic syndrome: from the LIPGENE study.
21115178|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Variants of the TCF7L2 gene predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We investigated the associations between gene variants of TCF7L2 and clinical features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) (an entity often preceding T2DM), and their interaction with non-genetic factors, including plasma saturated fatty acids (SFA) concentration and insulin resistance (IR). METHODS: Fasting lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, anthropometrics, blood pressure and 10 gene variations of the TCF7L2 gene were determined in 450 subjects with MetS. RESULTS: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) showed phenotypic associations independent of SFA or IR. Carriers of the rare T allele of rs7903146, and of three other SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs7903146, had lower blood pressure and insulin secretion. High IR and the presence of the T-allele of rs7903146 acted synergistically to define those with reduced insulin secretion. Carriers of the minor allele of rs290481 exhibited an altered lipid profile, with increased plasma levels of apolipoprotein B, non-esterified fatty acids, cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in triglyceride rich lipoproteins, and LDL cholesterol. Carriers of the minor allele of rs11196224 that had higher plasma SFA levels showed elevated procoagulant/proinflammatory biomarkers, impaired insulin secretion and increased IR, whereas carriers of the minor allele of rs17685538 with high plasma SFA levels exhibited higher blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SNP in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with differences in insulin secretion, blood pressure, blood lipids and coagulation in MetS patients, and may be modulated by SFA in plasma or IR.

21133856|t|Genome-wide association scan allowing for epistasis in type 2 diabetes.
21133856|a|In the presence of epistasis multilocus association tests of human complex traits can provide powerful methods to detect susceptibility variants. We undertook multilocus analyses in 1924 type 2 diabetes cases and 2938 controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). We performed a two-dimensional genome-wide association (GWA) scan using joint two-locus tests of association including main and epistatic effects in 70,236 markers tagging common variants. We found two-locus association at 79 SNP-pairs at a Bonferroni-corrected P-value = 0.05 (uncorrected P-value = 2.14 * 10       ). The 79 pair-wise results always contained rs11196205 in TCF7L2 paired with 79 variants including confirmed variants in FTO, TSPAN8, and CDKAL1, which are associated in the absence of epistasis. However, the majority (82%) of the 79 variants did not have compelling single-locus association signals (P-value = 5 * 10      ). Analyses conditional on the single-locus effects at TCF7L2 established that the joint two-locus results could be attributed to single-locus association at TCF7L2 alone. Interaction analyses among the peak 80 regions and among 23 previously established diabetes candidate genes identified five SNP-pairs with case-control and case-only epistatic signals. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of systematic scans in GWA data, but confirm that single-locus association can underlie and obscure multilocus findings.

21150882|t|Replication of genetic variants from genome-wide association studies with metabolic traits in an island population of the Adriatic coast of Croatia.
21150882|a|Twenty-two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 gene regions previously identified in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were evaluated for association with metabolic traits in a sample from an island population of European descent. We performed a population-based study using 18 anthropometric and biochemical traits considered as continuous variables in a sample of 843 unrelated subjects (360 men and 483 women) aged 18-80 years old from the island of Hvar on the eastern Adriatic coast of Croatia. All eight GWAS SNPs in FTO were significantly associated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference and hip circumference; 20 of the 32 nominal P-values remained significant after permutation testing for multiple corrections. The strongest associations were found between the two TCF7L2 GWAS SNPs with fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels, all four P-values remained significant after permutation tests. Nominally significant associations were found between several SNPs and other metabolic traits; however, the significance did not hold after permutation tests. Although the sample size was modest, our study strongly replicated the association of FTO variants with obesity-related measures and TCF7L2 variants with T2D-related traits. The estimated effect sizes of these variants were larger or comparable to published studies. This is likely attributable to the homogenous genetic background of the relatively isolated study population.

21153532|t|Association of indices of liver and adipocyte insulin resistance with 19 confirmed susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes in 6,733 non-diabetic Finnish men.
21153532|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Of the confirmed type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci only a few are known to affect insulin sensitivity. We examined the association of indices of hepatic and adipocyte insulin resistance (IR) with 19 confirmed type 2 diabetes risk loci in a large population-based study. METHODS: Non-diabetic participants (n   =   8,460, age 57.3        7.0  years, BMI 26.8        3.8  kg/m(2); mean    SD) from a population-based cohort underwent an OGTT. Of them, 6,733 non-diabetic men were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near PPARG2 (also known as PPARG), KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2B, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, HNF1B, WFS1, JAZF1, CDC123, TSPAN8, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, KCNQ1, MTNR1B and SNP rs7480010. We investigated hepatic IR with a new index of liver IR. The adipocyte IR index was defined as a product of fasting NEFA and plasma insulin levels. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes risk SNPs in or near KCNJ11 and HHEX were significantly (p   <   0.0013), and those in or near CDKN2B, NOTCH2 and MTNR1B were nominally (p   <   0.05), associated with decreased liver IR index. The Pro12 allele of PPARG2 was significantly associated with a high adipocyte IR index and nominally associated with high liver IR. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The Pro12 allele of PPARG2 seems to impair insulin's antilipolytic effect, leading to high NEFA release in the fasting state and IR. In addition, the type 2 diabetes risk alleles of KCNJ11 and HHEX, which are known to impair insulin secretion, were associated with increased hepatic insulin sensitivity.

21159844|t|Variants and haplotypes of TCF7L2 are associated with b-cell function in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: the Verona Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Study (VNDS) 1.
21159844|a|CONTEXT: Intronic variants of TCF7L2 are confirmed genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes and are associated to alterations in beta cell function in nondiabetic individuals. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test whether TCF7L2 variability may affect b-cell function also in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional association study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital referral center for diabetes. PATIENTS: Patients included 464 (315 males and 149 females) glutamic acid decarboxylase-negative patients [age: median 59 yr (interquartile range: 52-65); body mass index: 29.3 kg/m(2) (26.5-32.9); fasting plasma glucose: 7.0 mmol/liter (6.1-8.0)] with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION(S): Interventions included frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test and euglycemic insulin clamp. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): b-Cell function (derivative control and proportional control); insulin sensitivity; genotypes of the following TCF7L2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms: rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372. RESULTS: Both rs7901695 and rs7903146 diabetes risk alleles were associated with reduced proportional control of b-cell function (P = 0.019 and P = 0.022, respectively). Two low-frequency haplotypes were associated with extreme (best and worst) phenotypes of b-cell function (P < 0.01). No associations between TCF7L2 genotypes and insulin sensitivity were detected. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 diabetes risk variants, either as single-nucleotide polymorphisms or as haplotypes, detrimentally influence b-cell function and might play a role in determining the metabolic phenotype of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

21169132|t|Genetic polymorphisms in diabetes: influence on therapy with oral antidiabetics.
21169132|a|Due to new genetic insights, etiologic classification of diabetes is under constant scrutiny. Hundreds, or even thousands, of genes are linked with type 2 diabetes. Three common variants (Lys23 of KCNJ11, Pro12 of PPARG, and the T allele at rs7903146 of TCF7L2) have been shown to be predisposed to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Individually, each of these polymorphisms is only moderately predisposed to type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, monogenic forms of diabetes such as MODY and neonatal diabetes are characterized by unique clinical features and the possibility of applying a tailored treatment.Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, receptors, and other drug targets have been linked to interindividual differences in the efficacy and toxicity of a number of medications. Mutations in genes important in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) play a critical role in pharmacogenetics of diabetes.There are currently five major classes of oral pharmacological agents available to treat type 2 diabetes: sulfonylureas, meglitinides, metformin (a biguanide), thiazolidinediones, and a-glucosidase inhibitors. Other classes are also mentioned in literature.In this work, different types of genetic mutations (mutations of the gene for glucokinase, HNF 1a, HNF1b and Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunit of KATP channel, PPAR-y, OCT1 and OCT2, cytochromes, direct drug-receptor (KCNJ11), as well as the factors that influence the development of the disease (TCF7L2) and variants of genes that lead to hepatosteatosis caused by thiazolidinediones) and their influence on the response to therapy with oral antidiabetics will be reviewed.

21187013|t|Bio-informatics analysis of a gene co-expression module in adipose tissue containing the diet-responsive gene Nnat.
21187013|a|BACKGROUND: Obesity causes insulin resistance in target tissues - skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and the brain. Insulin resistance predisposes to type-2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adipose tissue inflammation is an essential characteristic of obesity and insulin resistance. Neuronatin (Nnat) expression has been found to be altered in a number of conditions related to inflammatory or metabolic disturbance, but its physiological roles and regulatory mechanisms in adipose tissue, brain, pancreatic islets and other tissues are not understood. RESULTS: We identified transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) conserved in the Nnat promoter, and transcription factors (TF) abundantly expressed in adipose tissue. These include transcription factors concerned with the control of: adipogenesis (Ppary, Klf15, Irf1, Creb1, Egr2, Gata3); lipogenesis (Mlxipl, Srebp1c); inflammation (Jun, Stat3); insulin signalling and diabetes susceptibility (Foxo1, Tcf7l2). We also identified NeuroD1 the only documented TF that controls Nnat expression. We identified KEGG pathways significantly associated with Nnat expression, including positive correlations with inflammation and negative correlations with metabolic pathways (most prominently oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism) and protein turnover. 27 genes, including; Gstt1 and Sod3, concerned with oxidative stress; Sncg and Cxcl9 concerned with inflammation; Ebf1, Lgals12 and Fzd4 involved in adipogenesis; whose expression co-varies with Nnat were identified, and conserved transcription factor binding sites identified on their promoters. Functional networks relating to each of these genes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that Nnat is an acute diet-responsive gene in white adipose tissue and hypothalamus; it may play an important role in metabolism, adipogenesis, and resolution of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to dietary excess.

21188353|t|Replication of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci for fasting plasma glucose in African-Americans.
21188353|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Chronically elevated blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) is the primary indicator of type 2 diabetes, which has a prevalence that varies considerably by ethnicity in the USA, with African-Americans disproportionately affected. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of diabetes and related traits, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG). However, the majority of GWASs have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. Thus, it is important to conduct replication analyses in populations with non-European ancestry to identify shared loci associated with FPG across populations. METHODS: We used data collected from non-diabetic unrelated African-American individuals (n = 927) who participated in the Howard University Family Study to attempt to replicate previously published GWASs of FPG. Of the 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported, we directly tested 20 in this study. In addition to the direct test, we queried a 500 kb window centred on all 29 reported SNPs for local replication of additional markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD). RESULTS: Using direct SNP and LD-based comparisons, we replicated multiple SNPs previously associated with FPG and strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in populations with European ancestry. The replicated SNPs included those in or near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, G6PC2, MTNR1B, DGKB-TMEM195 and GCKR. We also replicated additional variants in LD with the reported SNPs in ZMAT4 and adjacent to IRS1. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified multiple GWAS variants for FPG in our cohort of African-Americans. Using an LD-based strategy we also identified SNPs not previously reported, demonstrating the utility of using diverse populations for replication analysis.

21349175|t|TCF7L2 and therapeutic response to sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes.
21349175|a|BACKGROUND: Variants in the TCF7L2 have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since the association with diabetes could be explained by effects on insulin secretion, we investigated whether patients with diabetes risk alleles at rs7903146 might have an altered hypoglycaemic response to sulfonylureas (SUs). METHODS: We recruited 189 patients with T2D being treated with SUs and determined the rs7903146 diabetes risk genotype. We used a logistic regression with secondary SU failure defined as an A1C >= 7.0% after 6 months of SU treatment. RESULTS: In univariate regression analyses, TCF7L2 genotype was the only predictor of SU treatment failure. The rs7903146 T allele was significantly more frequent in the group of patients who failed to respond to SU (36%) than in the control group (26%) [P = 0.046; odds ratio (OR): 1.57 (1.01-2.45) in an additive mode of inheritance]. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with diabetes risk alleles in TCF7L2 have an altered hypoglycaemic response to SUs resulting in earlier secondary failure.

22891507|t|Shared genomics of type 2 and gestational diabetes mellitus.
22891507|a|Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and the prevalence of GDM is increasing worldwide. Short- and long-term complications of GDM on mothers and fetuses are well-recognized. These include more than seven-fold higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life in women with GDM than those without. Evidence supports that GDM shares several risk factors with T2DM, including genetic risks. This chapter reviewed studies on candidate genes shared by T2DM and GDM published from 1990 to 2011. At least 20 susceptible genes of T2DM have been studied in women with GDM in various races. Results from current association studies on T2DM susceptible genes in GDM have shown significant heterogeneity There may be primary evidence that polymorphisms of susceptible genes of T2DM such as transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, potassium channel voltage-gate KQT-like subfamily member 1 (KCNQ1) gene, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) gene, may increase risk of GDM. Associations between GDM and many genetic variants have led to different findings across populations. Many genetic polymorphisms related to GDM were investigated in a single study or a single population. Replication studies to verify contributions of both common and rare genetic variants for GDM and T2DM in specific racial/ethnic groups are needed.

21350842|t|Replication of 13 genome-wide association (GWA)-validated risk variants for type 2 diabetes in Pakistani populations.
21350842|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies and subsequent replication studies have greatly increased the number of validated type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants, but most of these have been conducted in European populations. Despite the high prevalence of the disease in South Asians, studies investigating GWA-validated type 2 diabetes risk variants in this ethnic group are limited. We investigated 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), predominantly derived from recent GWA studies, to determine if and to what extent these variants affect type 2 diabetes risk in two Punjabi populations, originating predominantly from the District of Mirpur, Pakistan. METHODS: Thirty SNPs were genotyped in 1,678 participants with type 2 diabetes and 1,584 normoglycaemic control participants from two populations; one resident in the UK and one indigenous to the District of Mirpur. RESULTS: SNPs in or near PPARG, TCF7L2, FTO, CDKN2A/2B, HHEX/IDE, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, KCNQ1, JAZF1, IRS1, KLF14, CHCHD9 and DUSP9 displayed significant (p < 0.05) associations with type 2 diabetes, with similar effect sizes to those seen in European populations. A constructed genetic risk score was associated with type 2 diabetes (p = 5.46 * 10(-12)), BMI (p = 2.25 * 10(-4)) and age at onset of diabetes (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have demonstrated that 13 variants confer an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in our Pakistani populations; to our knowledge this is the first time that SNPs in or near KCNQ1, JAZF1, IRS1, KLF14, CHCHD9 and DUSP9 have been significantly associated with the disease in South Asians. Large-scale studies and meta-analyses of South Asian populations are needed to further confirm the effect of these variants in this ethnic group.

21357677|t|TCF7L2 splice variants have distinct effects on beta-cell turnover and function.
21357677|a|Type 2 diabetes manifests when the b-cell fails to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to maintain normoglycemia and undergoes apoptosis. The disease progression results from an interplay of environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Polymorphisms in T-cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) strongly correlate with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While TCF7L2 mRNA is upregulated in islets in diabetes, protein levels are downregulated. The loss of TCF7L2 induces impaired function and apoptosis. By analyzing human isolated islets, we provide three explanations for this opposite regulation and the mechanisms of TCF7L2 on b-cell function and survival. (i) We found TCF7L2 transcripts in the human b-cell, which had opposite effects on b-cell survival, function and Wnt signaling activation. While TCF7L2 clone B1, which lacks exons 13, 14, 15 and 16 induced b-cell apoptosis, impaired function and inhibited glucagon-like peptide 1 response and downstream targets of Wnt signaling, clones B3 and B7 which both contain exon 13, improved b-cell survival and function and activated Wnt signaling. (ii) TCF7L2 mRNA is extremely unstable and is rapidly degraded under pro-diabetic conditions and (iii) TCF7L2 depletion in islets induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-b, but this was independent of endoplasmic reticulum stress. We demonstrated function-specific transcripts of TCF7L2, which possessed distinct physiological and pathophysiological effects on the b-cell. The presence of deleterious TCF7L2 splice variants may be a mechanism of b-cell failure in T2DM.

21384500|t|Association of TCF7L2 SNPs with age at onset of type 2 diabetes and proinsulin/insulin ratio but not with glucagon-like peptide 1.
21384500|a|BACKGROUND: Variants in TCF7L2 have been associated with the age at onset of type 2 diabetes in Mexican Americans. However, there is a lack of data on this relationship in Caucasians. Furthermore, risk alleles in TCF7L2 have been suggested to account for decreased conversion of proinsulin to insulin and decreased expression of GLP-1. We investigated the effect of the allelic variants rs1225537 and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 on the age at onset of type 2 diabetes, the plasma concentrations of proinsulin and GLP-1, and the ratio of proinsulin to insulin in a German cohort. METHODS: We studied 3185 participants of the LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular health (LURIC) study. Among these, 1021 subjects had type 2 diabetes. Data on age at onset of diabetes were available in 925 subjects. OGTTs were performed in a subgroup not previously known to have diabetes. RESULTS: Carriers of the risk alleles in rs1225537 and rs7901346 had increased risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated HbA(1c) (all p < 0.001). The risk alleles were also associated with early onset of type 2 diabetes, decreased insulin secretion and markedly increased proinsulin and proinsulin to insulin ratio (all p < 0.03). GLP-1 was not significantly related to the TCF7L2 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that TCF7L2 variants are associated with an early age of onset of type 2 diabetes in Caucasians and affects the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. However, TCF7L2 is not consistently associated with fasting GLP-1.

21389731|t|A principal components-based clustering method to identify variants associated with complex traits.
21389731|a|BACKGROUND: Multivariate methods ranging from joint SNP to principal components analysis (PCA) have been developed for testing multiple markers in a region for association with disease and disease-related traits. However, these methods suffer from low power and/or the inability to identify the subset of markers contributing to evidence for association under various scenarios. METHODS: We introduce orthoblique principal components-based clustering (OPCC) as an alternative approach to identify specific subsets of markers showing association with a quantitative outcome of interest. We demonstrate the utility of OPCC using simulation studies and an example from the literature on type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Compared to traditional methods, OPCC has similar or improved power under various scenarios of linkage disequilibrium structure and genotype availability. Most importantly, our simulations show how OPCC accurately parses large numbers of markers to a subset containing the causal variant or its proxy. CONCLUSION: OPCC is a powerful and efficient data reduction method for detecting associations between gene variants and disease-related traits. Unlike alternative methodologies, OPCC has the ability to isolate the effect of causal SNP(s) from among large sets of markers in a candidate region. Therefore, OPCC is an improvement over PCA for testing multiple SNP associations with phenotypes of interest.

21399856|t|Variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and incident glucose intolerance in Japanese-Brazilians.
21399856|a|Common variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been found to be associated with type 2 diabetes in different ethnic groups. The Japanese-Brazilian population has one of the highest prevalence rates of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess whether two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2, rs7903146 and rs12255372, could predict the development of glucose intolerance in Japanese-Brazilians. In a population-based 7-year prospective study, we genotyped 222 individuals (72 males and 150 females, aged 56.2    10.5 years) with normal glucose tolerance at baseline. In the study population, we found that the minor allele frequency was 0.05 for SNP rs7903146 and 0.03 for SNP rs12255372. No significant allele or genotype association with glucose intolerance incidence was found for either SNP. Haplotypes were constructed with these two SNPs and three haplotypes were defined: CG (frequency: 0.94), TT (frequency = 0.027) and TG (frequency = 0.026). None of the haplotypes provided evidence for association with the incidence of glucose intolerance. Despite no associations between incidence of glucose intolerance and SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene in Japanese-Brazilians, we found that carriers of the CT genotype for rs7903146 had significantly lower insulin levels 2 h after a 75-g glucose load than carriers of the CC genotype. In conclusion, in Japanese-Brazilians, a population with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, common TCF7L2 variants did not make major contributions to the incidence of glucose tolerance abnormalities.

21414605|t|At-risk variant in TCF7L2 for type II diabetes increases risk of schizophrenia.
21414605|a|BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk of type II diabetes and metabolic disorders. However, it is unclear whether this comorbidity reflects shared genetic risk factors, at-risk lifestyle, or side effects of antipsychotic medication. METHODS: Eleven known risk variants of type II diabetes were genotyped in patients with schizophrenia in a sample of 410 Danish patients, each matched with two healthy control subjects on sex, birth year, and month. Replication was carried out in a large multinational European sample of 4089 patients with schizophrenia and 17,597 controls (SGENE+) using Mantel-Haenszel test. RESULTS: One type II diabetes at-risk allele located in TCF7L2, rs7903146 [T], was associated with schizophrenia in the discovery sample (p = .0052) and in the replication with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.14, p = .033). CONCLUSION: The association reported here with a well-known diabetes variant suggests that the observed comorbidity is partially caused by genetic risk variants. This study also demonstrates how genetic studies can successfully examine an epidemiologically derived hypothesis of comorbidity.

21423583|t|Single nucleotide polymorphisms of TCF7L2 are linked to diabetic coronary atherosclerosis.
21423583|a|BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) shares common risk factors with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Variations in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, particularly rs7903146, increase T2DM risk. Potential links between genetic variants of the TCF7L2 locus and coronary atherosclerosis are uncertain. We therefore investigated the association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and angiographically determined CAD in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We genotyped TCF7L2 variants rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs11196205 in a cross-sectional study including 1,650 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of established or suspected stable CAD. Significant CAD was diagnosed in the presence of coronary stenoses >= 50%. Variant rs7903146 in the total study cohort was significantly associated with significant CAD (adjusted additive OR=1.29 [1.09-1.53]; p=0.003). This association was strong and significant in T2DM patients (n=393; OR=1.91 [1.32-2.75]; p=0.001) but not in non-diabetic subjects (OR=1.09 [0.90-1.33]; p=0.370). The interaction risk allele by T2DM was significant (p(interaction)=0.002), indicating a significantly stronger impact of the polymorphism on CAD in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic subjects. TCF7L2 polymorphisms rs12255372 and rs11196205 were also significantly associated with CAD in diabetic patients (adjusted additive OR=1.90 [1.31-2.74]; p=0.001 and OR=1.75 [1.22-2.50]; p=0.002, respectively). Further, haplotype analysis demonstrated that haplotypes including the rare alleles of all investigated variants were significantly associated with CAD in the whole cohort as well as in diabetic subjects (OR=1.22 [1.04-1.43]; p=0.013 and OR=1.67 [1.19-2.22]; p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that TCF7L2 variants rs7903146 rs12255372, and rs11196205 are significantly associated with angiographically diagnosed CAD, specifically in patients with T2DM. TCF7L2 therefore appears as a genetic link between diabetes and atherosclerosis.

21437630|t|Association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, PCSK1 and PCSK2) and proinsulin conversion in a Chinese population.
21437630|a|TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 have been found to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as with impaired proinsulin processing recently, enzymes encoded by PCSK1 and PCSK2 are reported to play an important role in the process of proinsulin conversion. To investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2, SLC30A8, PCSK1 and PCSK2 were associated with T2DM as well as with proinsulin conversion in a Han Chinese population from Chongqing. A case-control study was performed in Han Chinese subjects with normal control (n=152) and T2DM (n=227), we genotyped rs7903146 and rs11196218 at TCF7L2, rs13266634 at SLC30A8, rs3811951 at PCSK1 and rs2021785 at PCSK2. Plasma levels of proinsulin were measured with an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genotype distribution and associations with T2DM and fasting levels of proinsulin and proinsulin/insulin ratios were analyzed. We confirmed the association of risk allele of rs2021785 at PCSK2 with type 2 diabetes also existed in Han Chinese population [OR=1.4489 with 95% CI (1.0285, 2.0412), P=0.0335]. Rs13266634 at SLC30A8 had a tendency to be associated with fasting plasma levels of proinsulin (P=0.0639 in additive model). We did not find the significant association between other SNPs and T2DM or fasting levels of proinsulin or proinsulin/insulin ratios. Our results provide evidence that the association of PCSK2 and T2DM was also existed in Han Chinese population in Chongqing. We were underpowered to detect the association between other SNPs and T2DM or proinsulin conversion.

21441683|t|Screening with OGTT alone or in combination with the Indian diabetes risk score or genotyping of TCF7L2 to detect undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in Asian Indians.
21441683|a|BACKGROUND _ OBJECTIVES: With increasing number of people with diabetes worldwide, particularly in India, it is necessary to search for low cost screening methods. We compared the effectiveness and costs of screening for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) alone, or following a positive result from the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) or following a positive result from genotyping of the TCF7L2 polymorphisms in Asian Indians. METHODS: In subjects without known diabetes (n=961) recruited from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), OGTT, IDRS, and genotyping of rs12255372 (G/T) and rs7903146(C/T) of TCF7L2 polymorphisms were done. IDRS includes four parameters: age, abdominal obesity, family history of T2DM and physical activity. RESULTS: OGTT identified 72 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD), according to the World Health Organization criteria of fasting plasma glucose >=  126 mg/dl or a plasma glucose >=  200 mg/dl, 2 h after 75 g oral glucose load. IDRS screening (cut-off >=  60) yielded 413 positive subjects, which included 54 (75%) of the 72 NDD subjects identified by OGTT. Genotyping yielded 493 positive subjects which only included 36 (50%) of the 72 NDD subjects showing less discriminatory power. Screening with both SNPs missed 27 (37.5%) NDD subjects identified by IDRS. In contrast, IDRS missed only 9 (12.5%) of the NDD subjects identified by genotyping. Total screening cost for OGTT alone, or with IDRS were rs 384,400 and 182,810 respectively. Comparing OGTT alone to IDRS followed by OGTT, the incremental cost per additional NDD subject detected by doing OGTT on everyone was rs 11,199 (rs 201,590 for detecting additional 18 NDD subjects). INTERPRETATION _ CONCLUSIONS: For screening a population of subjects without diagnosed diabetes in India, a simple diabetes risk score is more effective and less expensive than genotyping or doing OGTT on the whole population.

21448825|t|[Recent advances in type 2 diabetes mellitus].
21448825|a|Currently, the oral glucose tolerance test remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing type 2 diabetes, HbA (1c) being of subordinate value because of its limited diagnostic sensitivity. Fully evaluated risk scores and questionnaires are helpful in determining individual type 2 diabetes risk profiles and may prove valuable tools in preventing this type of diabetes. Genetic studies support our current understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. In the near future genetic data may become useful in optimizing individual preventative and therapeutic strategies. Recent data suggest that it is reasonable to adjust therapeutic aims on the specific situation of individual patients for achieving optimal results. The present therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been rapidly extended over the recent years. To deal with this situation, pharmacovigilance is an essential tool to ensure drug safety and improve existing therapeutic standards.

21510814|t|Association of genetic variations in TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, LOC387761, and EXT2 with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Tunisia.
21510814|a|AIM: In recent genome-wide association studies, genetic variants in TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, LOC387761, and EXT2 were associated with risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed at investigating the association of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with T2DM and defining their corresponding allelic and genotypic combinations in the Tunisian population. We also tried to determine the effect of R325W of SLC30A8 on the modeled structural properties of the protein. METHODS: Five SNPs were genotyped in 331 T2DM Tunisian patients and 403 healthy subjects by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A model of residues 318-366 of the SLC30A8 protein was built by homology modeling. RESULTS: LOC387761 provided the strongest evidence for replication, where rs7480010 presented a risk of 2.41 with T2DM, followed by rs1111875 in HHEX (odds ratio=1.95) and rs13266634 in SLC30A8 (odds ratio=1.59). None of the two other SNPs previously reported was associated. The highest risk of T2DM was 3.1, obtained by the genotype combination of the three associated SNPs. Modeling of the cytoplasmic part of the SLC30A8 protein showed that the R325W change might affect the electrostatic potential of the SLC30A8 protein. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the SLC30A8, HHEX, and LOC387761 are more likely to represent the genuine signals of T2DM in the Tunisian population.

21543200|t|Dietary saturated fat, gender and genetic variation at the TCF7L2 locus predict the development of metabolic syndrome.
21543200|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest genetic determinant of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and insulin-related phenotypes to date. Dietary fat is a key environmental factor which may interact with genotype to affect risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2DM. This study investigated the relationship between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, insulin sensitivity/resistance and MetS in the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX study of MetS cases and matched controls (n=1754) and determined potential interactions with dietary fat intake. Female minor T allele carriers of rs7903146 had increased MetS risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.70, P=.04) and displayed elevated insulin concentrations (P=.005), impaired insulin sensitivity (P=.011), increased abdominal obesity (P=.008) and body mass index (P=.001) and higher blood pressure (P<.05) compared to the CC homozygotes. Metabolic syndrome risk was also modulated by dietary saturated fat (SFA) intake (P=.035 for interaction). High dietary SFA intake (>= 15.5% energy) exacerbated MetS risk (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.29-4.27, P=.005) and was associated with further impaired insulin sensitivity in the T allele carriers relative to the CC homozygotes (P=.025) and particularly to the T allele carriers with the lowest SFA intake (P=.008). No significant genotype effect on MetS risk or insulin sensitivity was evident among low-SFA consumers. In conclusion, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism influences MetS risk, which is augmented by both gender and dietary SFA intake, suggesting novel gene-diet-gender interactions.

21550079|t|Genotype risk score of common susceptible variants for prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese: the Shimanami Health Promoting Program (J-SHIPP study). Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and genotype risk score.
21550079|a|Recent genomewide association studies have successfully identified several genotypes susceptible to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, only a few studies have investigated whether these variations confer a risk of the future development of T2DM. We conducted a longitudinal genetic epidemiological study to clarify the prognostic significance of the T2DM-associated variants. The sample population consisted of 2037 middle-aged to elderly community residents. Personal health records were obtained from a clinical database administered by the local government. Genotype risk score was calculated by the following variants, namely, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, IGF2BP2, CDKN2AB, SLC30A8, KCNJ11, PPARG, and GCKR. Susceptibility of these variants in Japanese has been confirmed by association analysis. Among the 1824 subjects who did not have T2DM at baseline, 95 cases of T2DM were newly diagnosed during the 9.4-year follow-up period. Mean genotype risk score in these subjects was significantly higher than that in the subjects who remained nondiabetic (9.5     1.8 vs 9.1    2.0, P = .042). Although the initial mean body mass index (24.7    3.2 vs 23.0    2.8, P < .001) and initial glucose (106    18 vs 90    13, P < .001) were also significantly higher in those subjects who developed T2DM, the genotype risk score remained an independent determinant of the development of T2DM even after adjustment for these parameters and possible confounding factors. Per-allele odds ratio for the development of T2DM was 1.12 (95%  confidence interval, 1.00-1.25; P = .049). Type 2 diabetes mellitus-susceptible genetic variants identified by a cross-sectional genomewide association study were significantly associated with the future development of T2DM in a general population sample.

21595284|t|[Association between polymorphisms of TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes with special reference to incretin action].
21595284|a|TCF7L2 is a Wnt signaling-associated transcription factor and is ubiquitously expressed. Polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene exhibit the strongest association with type 2 diabetes among approximately twenty susceptibility gene variants identified to date. Although the mechanisms by which TCF7L2 affects susceptibility to type 2 diabetes remain to be elucidated, several studies have shown that decreased TCF7L2 protein inhibits the insulin secretory response to oral glucose through impaired incretin action(GLP-1, GIP). In this review, we discuss studies that investigate the association between polymorphisms of TCF7L2 and the diabetic phenotype, especially in vitro beta cell function with special reference to incretin action and the response to lifestyle intervention.

21637413|t|Replication of TCF7L2 rs7903146 association with type 2 diabetes in an Iranian population.
21637413|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) rs7903146 T allele is constantly associated with Type 2 diabetes in various populations and ethnic groups. Nevertheless, this has not been observed in two studies involving Arab populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 in an Iranian population. Type 2 diabetes patients (N = 258) and normal healthy control subjects (N = 168) from the same area, were examined. The ARMS- PCR (Amplification Refractory Mutation System) technique, subsequently validated by direct sequencing, was used for genotyping. Allele and genotype frequencies were significantly different between patients and controls TT vs. CT + CC [p 0.0081 OR 3.4 95%CI (1.27-11.9)] and T vs. C allele [p 0.02 OR 1.4 95%CI (1.03-1.9)]. Our data thus confirm the association between the rs7903146 T allele and T2D in an Iranian population, contrary to previous reports in Arab populations. This can possibly be attributed to differences in ethnic background or the effects of environmental factors.

21641671|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism and complication/comorbidity profile in type 2 diabetes patients.
21641671|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) has been associated with type 2 diabetes. We investigated the association of the rs7903146 SNP in this gene with clinical profile of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. The study involved 980 patients with diabetic nephropathy (44%), diabetic retinopathy (42%), CVD (65%) and early onset of diabetes (45%) and 924 healthy controls. Subjects were genotyped for rs7903146 by PCR-RFLP. Genotype frequencies significantly differed between T2DM patients and controls (p<0.01, odds ratio (OR) for TT genotype 2.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-3.39). An association was observed between rs7903146 and nephropathy (p<0.001), with 22% of TT homozygotes in this subgroup vs. 11% in patients without nephropathy (p=0.006, OR for TT 2.83, 95% CI 1.94-4.13). Association was stronger in patients with early onset of diabetes (34% of TT vs. 12% in the late onset, p<0.001). In DN group 71% of TT homozygotes had an early onset (OR 7.64, 95% CI 4.98-11.73 vs. controls). Our results confirm association of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The T allele is strongly associated with nephropathy, especially in early onset of diabetes.

21672010|t|Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms independent of HLA-DQB1*0602 genotypes and islet cell autoantibodies.
21672010|a|AIMS: To test whether the TCF7L2 gene was associated with gestational diabetes, whether the association between TCF7L2 and gestational diabetes was independent of HLA-DQB1*0602 and islet cell autoantibodies, as well as maternal age, number of pregnancies, family history of diabetes and the HLA-DQB1 genotypes, and to test whether the distribution of HLA-DQB1 alleles was affected by country of birth. METHODS: We genotyped the rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs7901695 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene in 826 mothers with gestational diabetes and in 1185 healthy control subjects in the Diabetes Prediction in Sk  ne Study. The mothers were also typed for HLA-DQB1 genotypes and tested for islet cell autoantibodies against GAD65, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 and insulin. RESULTS: The heterozygous genotypes CT, GT and TC of the rs7903146 (T is risk for Type 2 diabetes), rs12255372 (T is risk for Type 2 diabetes) and rs7901695 (C is risk for Type 2 diabetes), respectively, as well as the homozygous genotypes TT, TT and CC of the rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs7901695, respectively, were strongly associated with gestational diabetes (P < 0.0001). These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for maternal age, number of pregnancies, family history of diabetes and HLA-DQ genotypes and were independent of the presence of islet cell autoantibodies. No interaction was observed between TCF7L2 and HLA-DQB1*0602, which was shown to be negatively associated with gestational diabetes in mothers born in Sweden (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The TCF7L2 was associated with susceptibility for gestational diabetes independently of the presence of HLA-DQB1*0602 and islet cell autoantibodies and other factors such as maternal age, number of pregnancies, family history of diabetes and other HLA-DQ genotypes. The HLA-DQB1*0602 was negatively associated with gestational diabetes in mothers born in Sweden.

21673050|t|Alterations in TCF7L2 expression define its role as a key regulator of glucose metabolism.
21673050|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently implicated noncoding variation within the TCF7L2 locus with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. While this locus represents the strongest genetic determinant for T2D risk in humans, it remains unclear how these noncoding variants affect disease etiology. To test the hypothesis that the T2D-associated interval harbors cis-regulatory elements controlling TCF7L2 expression, we conducted in vivo transgenic reporter assays to characterize the TCF7L2 regulatory landscape. We found that the 92-kb genomic interval associated with T2D harbors long-range enhancers regulating various aspects of the spatial-temporal expression patterns of TCF7L2, including expression in tissues involved in the control of glucose homeostasis. By selectively deleting this interval, we establish a critical role for these enhancers in robust TCF7L2 expression. To further determine whether variation in Tcf7l2 expression may lead to diabetes, we developed a Tcf7l2 copy-number allelic series in mice. We show that a null Tcf7l2 allele leads, in a dose-dependent manner, to lower glycemic profiles. Tcf7l2 null mice also display enhanced glucose tolerance coupled to significantly lowered insulin levels, suggesting that these mice are protected against T2D. Confirming these observations, transgenic mice harboring multiple Tcf7l2 copies and overexpressing this gene display reciprocal phenotypes, including glucose intolerance. These results directly demonstrate that Tcf7l2 plays a role in regulating glucose tolerance, suggesting that overexpression of this gene is associated with increased risk of T2D. These data highlight the role of enhancer elements as mediators of T2D risk in humans, strengthening the evidence that variation in cis-regulatory elements may be a paradigm for genetic predispositions to common disease.

21678030|t|Association of a common variant in TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Persian population.
21678030|a|Diabetes is one of the most common and challenging health problems. Studies in several nations show that polymorphisms within the transcription factor 7-like 2 genes could be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therefore, a case-control study was conducted to find the association between SNP rs7903146 and T2D in our population. The study consists of 110 patients referring to clinic and 80 healthy controls randomly selected based on WHO guideline. DNA was extracted from blood and genotyped by PCR-RFLP with specific primers to amplify a fragment for restriction enzyme (RsaI). A chi-square test was calculated to compare the proportions of genotypes or alleles. Using a logistic regression model, the odds ratio for risk of developing T2D was calculated with and without adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. The frequency of the T allele of rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism was significantly higher in diabetic subjects (47.3%) compared to that in normal subjects (34.4%). Logistic regression analysis of the rs7903146 polymorphism showed that the odds ratio was 3.71(95% CI: 1.43-9.56; P: 0.008) for the TT genotype and 1.26 (95% CI: 0.67-2.39; P: 0.516) for the CT genotype when compared with the CC genotype. Odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, and BMI have shown similar results. The results show that rs7903146 of TCF7L2 gene is an important susceptibility gene for T2D mellitus in the province of Isfahan, Iran. Our results support the recent findings that rs7903146 of TCF7L2 gene is an important genetic risk factor for the development of T2D in multiple ethnic groups.

21704609|t|Effect of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of glimepiride in a Korean population.
21704609|a|BACKGROUNDS: Glimepiride is a commonly used sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent. There is considerable interindividual variation in the response to sulfonylurea for patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations influence the efficacy of glimepiride in healthy Korean subjects. METHODS: A single 2-mg oral dose of glimepiride was administered to 46 healthy volunteers. Serial blood sampling for 12h after oral dosing was performed for determination of plasma glimepiride, glucose and insulin levels. We tested the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four candidate genes with the efficacy of glimepiride. RESULTS: Pharmacodynamic profiles for plasma glucose and insulin showed no statistically significant differences among genotype groups, and parameters were not different from one another. There were no association of the KCNJ11, NOS1AP, TCF7L2 and ABCC8 gene polymorphisms and the efficacy of glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of these polymorphisms provides no clinical useful information for the pharmacogenetic therapeutic approach for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes.

21707949|t|Association of TCF7L2 allelic variations with gastric function, satiation, and GLP-1 levels.
21707949|a|OBJECTIVE: Genetic variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), a regulator of proglucagon processing, is reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 alters gastric function and increases satiation. HYPOTHESIS: Genetic variation in TCF7L2 is associated with satiation, gastric motor function, and GLP-1 concentrations. METHODS: In 62 adults, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) was genotyped and associations with gastric emptying (GE) of solids and liquids, gastric volume (GV), and satiation (maximum tolerated volume and symptoms after nutrient drink test) were explored using a dominant genetic model, with gender and BMI as covariates. In 50 of the participants, we also measured plasma GLP-1 during fasting and after ingestion of a nutrient drink. RESULTS: Presence of the T allele compared to CC genotype in rs7903146 SNP of the TCF7L2 gene was associated with reduced fasting GV (246.3    11.4 mL for CC group, compared to 215.7    11.4 mL for CT/TT group, p= 0.05) and accelerated GE t(1/2) of liquids (26.3    2.0 minutes for CC compared to 17.7    1.4 for CT/TT, p < 0.005). There was no significant association of rs7903146 SNP with GE of solids, gastric accommodation, satiation, fasting, or postprandial GLP-1. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest TCF7L2 is associated with altered gastric functions that may predispose to obesity.

21771967|t|Exendin-4 upregulates the expression of Wnt-4, a novel regulator of pancreatic b-cell proliferation.
21771967|a|The Wnt-signaling pathway regulates b-cell functions. It is not known how the expression of endogenous Wnt-signaling molecules is regulated in b-cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of antidiabetic drugs and glucose on the expression of Wnt-signaling molecules in b-cells. Primary islets were isolated and cultured. The expression of Wnt-signaling molecules (Wnt-4, Wnt-10b, Frizzled-4, LRP5, TCF7L2) and TNFa was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR and Western blotting. Transient transfections were carried out and proliferation assays of INS-1 b-cells performed using [(3)H]thymidine uptake and BrdU ELISA. Insulin secretion was quantified. A knockdown (siRNA) of Wnt-4 in b-cells was carried out. Exendin-4 significantly increased the expression of Wnt-4 in b-cells on the mRNA level (2.8-fold) and the protein level (3-fold) (P < 0.001). The effect was dose dependent, with strongest stimulation at 10 nM, and it was maintained after long-term stimulation over 4 wk. Addition of exd-(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, abolished the effect of exendin-4. Treatment with glucose, insulin, or other antidiabetic drugs had no effect on the expression of any of the examined Wnt-signaling molecules. Functionally, Wnt-4 antagonized the activation of canonical Wnt-signaling in b-cells. Wnt-4 had no effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or insulin gene expression. Knocking down Wnt-4 decreased b-cell proliferation to 45% of controls (P < 0.05). In addition, Wnt-4 and exendin-4 treatment decreased the expression of TNFaa mRNA in primary b-cells. These data demonstrate that stimulation with exendin-4 increases the expression of Wnt-4 in b-cells. Wnt-4 modulates canonical Wnt signaling and acts as regulator of b-cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokine release. This suggests a novel mechanism through which GLP-1 can regulate b-cell proliferation.

21814547|t|TCF7L2 polymorphism, weight loss and proinsulin:insulin ratio in the diabetes prevention program.
21814547|a|AIMS: TCF7L2 variants have been associated with type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and deficits in proinsulin processing and insulin secretion. Here we sought to test whether these effects were apparent in high-risk individuals and modify treatment responses. METHODS: We examined the potential role of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant in predicting resistance to weight loss or a lack of improvement of proinsulin processing during 2.5-years of follow-up participants (N=2,994) from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized controlled trial designed to prevent or delay diabetes in high-risk adults. RESULTS: We observed no difference in the degree of weight loss by rs7903146 genotypes. However, the T allele (conferring higher risk of diabetes) at rs7903146 was associated with higher fasting proinsulin at baseline (P<0.001), higher baseline proinsulin:insulin ratio (p<0.0001) and increased proinsulin:insulin ratio over a median of 2.5 years of follow-up (P=0.003). Effects were comparable across treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a lack of impact of the TCF7L2 genotypes on the ability to lose weight, but the presence of a consistent effect on the proinsulin:insulin ratio over the course of DPP, suggests that high-risk genotype carriers at this locus can successfully lose weight to counter diabetes risk despite persistent deficits in insulin production.

21834909|t|A replication study of the IRS1, CAPN10, TCF7L2, and PPARG gene polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes in two different populations of Mexico.
21834909|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic degenerative disease that involves the participation of several genetic and environmental factors. The objective of the study was to determine the association of the IRS1 (rs1801278), CAPN10 (rs3792267), TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), and PPARG (rs1801282) gene polymorphisms with T2D, in two different Mexican populations. We conducted a case-control replication study in the state of Guerrero and in Mexico City, with 400 subjects from Guerrero and 1065 from Mexico City. Data were analyzed by logistic regression, adjusting by ancestry, age, gender, and BMI, to determine the association with T2D. Heterozygosity for the Gly972Arg variant of the IRS1 gene showed the strongest association for T2D in both analyzed samples (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.12-5.26 and 2.64, 95% CI 1.37-5.10, respectively). In addition, an association of two SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene with T2D was observed in both cities: rs7903146, (for Guerrero OR = 1.98 CI95% 1.02-3.89 and for Mexico OR = 1.94 CI95% 1.31-2.88) and rs12255372 (OR = 1.79 CI95% 1.08-2.97, OR = 1.78 CI95% 1.17-2.71 respectively). We suggest that our results provide strong evidence that variation in the IRS1 and TCF7L2 genes confers susceptibility to T2D in our studied populations.

21857094|t|Association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism with posttransplant diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus.
21857094|a|New onset posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has a high incidence after kidney transplantation in patients medicated with tacrolimus. PTDM can adversely affect patient and graft survival. The pathophysiology of PTDM closely mimics type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One of the possible genetic factors predisposing individuals to PTDM might be a polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2). This polymorphism has previously been associated with increased risk of T2DM in the general population. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate TCF7L2 polymorphisms in PTDM in kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus. Non-diabetic kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus (n = 234) were genotyped for the presence of TCF7L2 gene variants (rs12255372 and rs7903146) using TaqMan probes. Of the 234 patients, 66 patients had developed PTDM and 168 had not. Frequencies of the studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not differ significantly between the study groups. Moreover, haplotype analyses failed to detect any associations between TCF7L2 haplotypes and PTDM. However, in late-onset PTDM (developed later that 2 weeks from transplantation), frequencies of the rs7903146 TT genotype and T minor allele were significantly increased compared to non-PTDM controls (17.9% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.017, OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 1.19-14.33 for TT genotype, 39.3% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.038 for T allele). If the application of TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNPs as a marker for PTDM is confirmed by further independent studies, replacing tacrolimus with other immunosuppressants could be warranted in patients at high risk of PTDM, as diagnosed by TCF7L2 genotyping.

21863614|t|Pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetic treatment.
21863614|a|In the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatment is the first line treatment after lifestyle measures fail. Two major groups of OAD are used in clinical practice--insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitisers. Sulphonyluea (SU) derivatives are insulin secretagogues and stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8 encode potassium channel proteins. KCNJ11 gene Glu23Lys polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of SU secondary failure, while Ser1369Ala polymorphism of ABCC8 gene had influence antidiabetic efficacy of SU drug gliclazide. In addition, the polymorphism of TCF7L2 gene, which has the strongest association with T2D, also influenced secondary SU drug failure. Insulin sensitisers include both metformin and glitazones. Some drug-genotype associations were observed for metformin in patients with T2D. Several genes influenced the effect of glitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone was more effective in diabetes control in carriers of Prol2Ala polymorphism of PPARG gene encoding the PPARg-receptor--the target of this drug. Rosiglitazone treatment had less effect on glycemic control and adiponectin increase in T2D patients with GG-genotypes of adiponectin (APM1) polymorphism. Pioglitazone treatment had smaller effect on glycemic control in patients with LPL Ser447X polymorphism. Identification of drug-genotype interactions in pharmacogenetic studies of the OAD treatment might have clinical implications in the near future resulting in selection of more specific "patient-tailored therapy" in T2D (Tab. 1, Ref. 58).

21873549|t|Genome-wide association identifies nine common variants associated with fasting proinsulin levels and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
21873549|a|OBJECTIVE: Proinsulin is a precursor of mature insulin and C-peptide. Higher circulating proinsulin levels are associated with impaired b-cell function, raised glucose levels, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Studies of the insulin processing pathway could provide new insights about T2D pathophysiology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We have conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association tests of    2.5 million genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting proinsulin levels in 10,701 nondiabetic adults of European ancestry, with follow-up of 23 loci in up to 16,378 individuals, using additive genetic models adjusted for age, sex, fasting insulin, and study-specific covariates. RESULTS: Nine SNPs at eight loci were associated with proinsulin levels (P < 5 * 10(-8)). Two loci (LARP6 and SGSM2) have not been previously related to metabolic traits, one (MADD) has been associated with fasting glucose, one (PCSK1) has been implicated in obesity, and four (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, VPS13C/C2CD4A/B, and ARAP1, formerly CENTD2) increase T2D risk. The proinsulin-raising allele of ARAP1 was associated with a lower fasting glucose (P = 1.7 * 10(-4)), improved b-cell function (P = 1.1 * 10(-5)), and lower risk of T2D (odds ratio 0.88; P = 7.8 * 10(-6)). Notably, PCSK1 encodes the protein prohormone convertase 1/3, the first enzyme in the insulin processing pathway. A genotype score composed of the nine proinsulin-raising alleles was not associated with coronary disease in two large case-control datasets. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified nine genetic variants associated with fasting proinsulin. Our findings illuminate the biology underlying glucose homeostasis and T2D development in humans and argue against a direct role of proinsulin in coronary artery disease pathogenesis.

21873553|t|Genetic analysis of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.
21873553|a|OBJECTIVE: In contrast with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, the genetics of autoimmune diabetes in adults are not well understood. We have therefore investigated the genetics of diabetes diagnosed in adults positive for autoantibodies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: GAD autoantibodies (GADAs), insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies (IA-2As), and islet cell autoantibodies were measured at time of diagnosis. Autoantibody-positive diabetic subjects (n = 1,384) and population-based control subjects (n = 2,235) were genotyped at 20 childhood-onset type 1 diabetes loci and FCRL3, GAD2, TCF7L2, and FTO. RESULTS: PTPN22 (1p13.2), STAT4 (2q32.2), CTLA4 (2q33.2), HLA (6p21), IL2RA (10p15.1), INS (11p15.5), ERBB3 (12q13.2), SH2B3 (12q24.12), and CLEC16A (16p13.13) were convincingly associated with autoimmune diabetes in adults (P <=  0.002), with consistent directions of effect as reported for pediatric type 1 diabetes. No evidence of an HLA-DRB1*03/HLA-DRB1*04 (DR3/4) genotype effect was obtained (P = 0.55), but it remained highly predisposing (odds ratio 26.22). DR3/4 was associated with a lower age at diagnosis of disease, as was DR4 (P = 4.67 * 10(-6)) but not DR3. DR3 was associated with GADA positivity (P = 6.03 * 10(-6)) but absence of IA-2A (P = 3.22 * 10(-7)). DR4 was associated with IA-2A positivity (P = 5.45 * 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the genetics of autoimmune diabetes in adults and children are differentiated by only relatively few age-dependent genetic effects. The slower progression toward autoimmune insulin deficiency in adults is probably due to a lower genetic load overall combined with subtle variation in the HLA class II gene associations and autoreactivity.

21864758|t|New type 2 diabetes risk genes provide new insights in insulin secretion mechanisms.
21864758|a|Type 2 diabetes results from the inability of beta cells to increase insulin secretion sufficiently to compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is thought to result mainly from environmental factors, such as obesity. However, there is compelling evidence that the decline of both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion have also a genetic component. Recent genome-wide association studies identified several novel risk genes for type 2 diabetes. The vast majority of these genes affect beta cell function by molecular mechanisms that remain unknown in detail. Nevertheless, we and others could show that a group of genes affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a group incretin-stimulated insulin secretion (incretin sensitivity or secretion) and a group proinsulin-to-insulin conversion. The most important so far type 2 diabetes risk gene, TCF7L2, interferes with all three mechanisms. In addition to advancing knowledge in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, the discovery of novel genetic determinants of diabetes susceptibility may help understanding of gene-environment, gene-therapy and gene-gene interactions. It was also hoped that it could make determination of the individual risk for type 2 diabetes feasible. However, the allelic relative risks of most genetic variants discovered so far are relatively low. Thus, at present, clinical criteria assess the risk for type 2 diabetes with greater sensitivity and specificity than the combination of all known genetic variants.

21898192|t|Worldwide distribution of type II diabetes-associated TCF7L2 SNPs: evidence for stratification in Europe.
21898192|a|Type II diabetes is a multifactorial disease with a complex etiology. Numerous genes have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. In particular, SNPs at the TCF7L2 locus have consistently shown strong associations with type II diabetes. This study characterizes the global distribution of type II diabetes-associated TCF7L2 SNPs utilizing HapMap, HGDP-CEPH, and Alfred databases and the literature. High frequencies of rs7903146(T), rs12255372(T), and rs7901695(C) SNPs are observed in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, but they are reduced and almost absent in Southeast Asian and Native American populations. In contrast, rs11196218(A) has the highest frequency in Eurasia but is reduced in sub-Saharan African and Native American populations. Regional variations in rs7903146(T) follow a gradient of decreasing frequency from southern into northeastern Europe. These findings demonstrate extensive global and regional variations in the frequencies of TCF7L2 SNPs, which may contribute to differences in the incidence of type II diabetes worldwide.

21901280|t|Chromatin occupancy of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and its role in hepatic glucose metabolism.
21901280|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The mechanisms by which transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) regulates the pathways that are important in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes are unknown. We therefore examined the role of TCF7L2 in hepatic glucose production (HGP) in vitro and characterised the whole-genome chromatin occupancy of TCF7L2 in hepatocytes. METHODS: We investigated the effect of TCF7L2 silencing and overexpression on HGP from gluconeogenic precursors and used chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to investigate the DNA binding patterns of TCF7L2 across the whole genome. RESULTS: Silencing of TCF7L2 induced a marked increase in basal HGP, which was accompanied by significant increases in the expression of the gluconeogenic genes Fbp1, Pck1 and G6pc. Overexpression of Tcf7l2 reversed this phenotype and significantly reduced HGP. TCF7L2 silencing did not affect the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of insulin or metformin, but HGP remained elevated in TCF7L2-silenced cells due to the increased baseline HGP. Using ChIP-Seq, we detected 2,119 binding events across the genome. Pathway analysis demonstrated that diabetes genes were significantly over-represented in the dataset. Our results indicate that TCF7L2 binds directly to multiple genes that are important in regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver, including Pck1, Fbp1, Irs1, Irs2, Akt2, Adipor1, Pdk4 and Cpt1a. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 is an important regulator of HGP in vitro and binds directly to genes that are important in pathways of glucose metabolism in the liver. These data highlight the possibility that TCF7L2 may affect fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia in carriers of at-risk TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms.

21911746|t|Effects of genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes on the evolution of glucose homeostasis traits before and after diabetes diagnosis: data from the D.E.S.I.R. Study.
21911746|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of genetic susceptibility on evolution toward type 2 diabetes (T2D) by analyzing time trajectories of fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA2%S]), and b-cell secretion (HOMA2%B) in a large nondiabetic cohort. We also examined whether baseline HbA(1c) modified the effect of genetic predisposition on the time trajectories. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Time trajectories were drawn in 4,744 participants from the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (D.E.S.I.R.) cohort based on samples collected every 3 years over a 9-year follow-up. Trajectories were analyzed according to the TCF7L2 common variant, a family history of T2D, and a combination of at-risk alleles from nine T2D-associated genes. RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in HOMA2%B in parallel to a steep increase in HbA(1c) over the 3 years before incident diabetes, which was not influenced by genetic predisposition when considered alone. However, after the onset of T2D, the TCF7L2 at-risk variant was associated with a greater decrease in HOMA2%B. There was a joint effect of a family history of T2D with the presence of the TCF7L2 risk allele with a greater rise in HbA(1c) conferred by the coexistence of a family history and the T risk allele. An HbA(1c) >= 5.7% at baseline was associated with a greater increase in both glycemia and HbA(1c) levels in the presence of a combination of diabetes at-risk alleles. CONCLUSIONS: After incident T2D, TCF7L2 at-risk variants were associated with a faster decrease in b-cell function compared with those with the CC genotype. There was a joint effect of family history of T2D and TCF7L2 risk variant on the rise in glycemia and the decrease in insulin secretion at the end of follow-up, suggesting the joint influence of the combination of diabetes genetic predisposition with familial factors on the evolution of glycemia over time.

21913056|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms within the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. It is widely hypothesised that the predisposing variation is involved in cis-regulation of TCF7L2 activity. The aim of this study was to seek evidence for the existence of novel TCF7L2 isoforms encoded within the type 2 diabetes-associated genomic region. METHODS: We searched expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for novel TCF7L2 transcripts and sought to validate the function and integrity of any isoforms found using a combination of RT-PCR, western blotting and reporter gene techniques. RESULTS: Analysis of EST databases suggested the presence of an alternative polyadenylation site located in intron 4 of TCF7L2. We used 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and real-time PCR to validate the integrity of this polyadenylation signal and show its wide use across human tissues. Western blotting results are consistent with the use of this polyadenylation signal to generate novel protein isoforms. The alternative polyadenylation signal results in the production of isoforms that retain the b-catenin binding domain but do not possess the high-mobility group box DNA-binding domain. Promoter-reporter gene assays suggest that these isoforms inhibit TCF7L2-dependent target genes by sequestering b-catenin. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have identified a novel polyadenylation signal within TCF7L2 that can result in the production of isoforms that act to repress TCF/LEF-dependent target genes. These findings may provide new insights into the association of TCF7L2 with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

21921652|t|Evaluation of the obesity genes FTO and MC4R and the type 2 diabetes mellitus gene TCF7L2 for contribution to stroke risk: The Mannheim-Heidelberg Stroke Study.
21921652|a|OBJECTIVE: Studies evaluating genetic markers for vascular risk and risk of stroke are limited, and none of them evaluated obesity genes. The objective was to investigate the genetic markers related to obesity genes FTO and MC4R and the gene of type 2 diabetes mellitus TCF7L2 for their contribution to risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA). METHODS: We recruited 379 consecutive patients with stroke/TIA and 379 healthy population-based controls. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs9937053 (FTO), rs2229616 (MC4R V103I), rs17782313 (188kb downstream of MC4R), and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) were evaluated for association with stroke using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The odds ratios for stroke/TIA were 1.14 (95%CI 0.91-1.42) for rs9937053/FTO, 1.11 (95%CI 0.49-2.51) for rs2229616/MC4R, 1.05 (95%CI 0.82-1.3) for rs17782313/MC4R, and 0.99 (95%CI 0.78-1.25) for rs7903146/TCF7L2. Further exploration revealed that male patients with the T allele of rs7903146/TCF7L2 had a worse clinical outcome compared with male patients carrying the C allele. CONCLUSION: The observed trends of obesity risk alleles for risk of stroke/TIA as well as the possible sex-specific differences in clinical outcomes found for the TCF7L2 (rs7903146) require replication in future studies. Our study demonstrates that candidate gene studies for common stroke may benefit from focusing on polymorphisms that predispose to vascular risk.

21949744|t|Effects of 16 genetic variants on fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in South Asians: ADCY5 and GLIS3 variants may predispose to type 2 diabetes.
21949744|a|BACKGROUND: The Meta-Analysis of Glucose and Insulin related traits Consortium (MAGIC) recently identified 16 loci robustly associated with fasting glucose, some of which were also associated with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of our study was to explore the role of these variants in South Asian populations of Punjabi ancestry, originating predominantly from the District of Mirpur, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 1678 subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1584 normoglycaemic controls from two Punjabi populations; one resident in the UK and one indigenous to the District of Mirpur. In the normoglycaemic controls investigated for fasting glucose associations, 12 of 16 SNPs displayed b values with the same direction of effect as that seen in European studies, although only the SLC30A8 rs11558471 SNP was nominally associated with fasting glucose (b=0.063 [95% CI: 0.013, 0.113] p=0.015). Of interest, the MTNR1B rs10830963 SNP displayed a negative b value for fasting glucose in our study; this effect size was significantly lower than that seen in Europeans (p=1.29 10(-4)). In addition to previously reported type 2 diabetes risk variants in TCF7L2 and SLC30A8, SNPs in ADCY5 (rs11708067) and GLIS3 (rs7034200) displayed evidence for association with type 2 diabetes, with odds ratios of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.39; p=9.1 10(-4)) and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.29; p=3.49 10(-3)) respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although only the SLC30A8 rs11558471 SNP was nominally associated with fasting glucose in our study, the finding that 12 out of 16 SNPs displayed a direction of effect consistent with European studies suggests that a number of these variants may contribute to fasting glucose variation in individuals of South Asian ancestry. We also provide evidence for the first time in South Asians that alleles of SNPs in GLIS3 and ADCY5 may confer risk of type 2 diabetes.

21959939|t|[Pharmacogenetics of insulin secretagogue antidiabetics].
21959939|a|Type 2 diabetes is making up to 90% of the all diabetic cases. In addition to insulin resistance, insufficient B-cell function also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The insufficient production and secretion of insulin can be increased by secretagogue drugs, like sulfonylureas and incretin mimetics/enhancers. In recent years growing number of genetic failures of the B-cells has been detected. These genetic variants can influence the efficacy of secretagogue drugs. Some of these gene polymorphisms were identified in the genes encoding the KATP channel (KCNJ11 and ABCC8). These mutations are able either to reduce or increase the insulin secretion and can modify the insulin response to sulfonylurea treatment. Other polymorphisms were found on genes encoding enzymes or transcription factors. In recent years, the genetic variants of TCF7L2 and its clinical importance have been intensely studied. Authors give a summary of the above gene polymorphisms and their role in insulin secretion.

21965303|t|Survival of pancreatic beta cells is partly controlled by a TCF7L2-p53-p53INP1-dependent pathway.
21965303|a|The transcription factor T-cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) confers type 2 diabetes risk mainly through impaired insulin secretion, perturbed incretin effect and reduced beta-cell survival. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanism through which TCF7L2 influences beta-cell survival. TCF7L2 target genes in INS-1 cells were identified using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation. Validation of targets was obtained by: siRNA silencing, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase reporter assays and western blot. Apoptosis rate was measured by DNA degradation and caspase-3 content. Islet viability was estimated by measuring metabolic rate. TCF7L2 binds to 3646 gene promoters in INS-1 cells in high or low glucose, including Tp53, Pten, Uggt1, Adamts9 and Fto. SiRNA-mediated reduction in TCF7L2 activity resulted in increased apoptosis and increased expression of Tp53, which resulted in elevated p53 protein activity and an increased expression of the p53 target gene Tp53inp1 (encoding p53-induced-nuclear-protein 1). Reversing the increase in p53INP1 protein expression, seen after Tcf7l2 silencing, protected INS-1 cells from Tcf7l2 depletion-induced apoptosis. This result was replicated in primary rat islets. The risk T-allele of rs7903146 is associated with increased TCF7L2 mRNA expression and transcriptional activity. On the other hand, in vitro silencing of TCF7L2 lead to increased apoptosis. One possibility is that the risk T-allele increases expression of an inhibitory TCF7L2 isoform with lower transcriptional activity. These results identify the p53-p53INP1 pathway as a molecular mechanism through which TCF7L2 may affect beta-cell survival and established a molecular link between Tcf7l2 and two type 2 diabetes-associated genes, Tp53inp1 and Adamts9.

22046400|t|Modulation ofTcf7l2 expression alters behavior in mice.
22046400|a|The comorbidity of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with several psychiatric diseases is well established. While environmental factors may partially account for these co-occurrences, common genetic susceptibilities could also be implicated in the confluence of these diseases. In support of shared genetic burdens, TCF7L2, the strongest genetic determinant for T2D risk in the human population, has been recently implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ) risk, suggesting that this may be one of many loci that pleiotropically influence both diseases. To investigate whether Tcf7l2 is involved in behavioral phenotypes in addition to its roles in glucose metabolism, we conducted several behavioral tests in mice with null alleles of Tcf7l2 or overexpressing Tcf7l2. We identified a role for Tcf7l2 in anxiety-like behavior and a dose-dependent effect of Tcf7l2 alleles on fear learning. None of the mutant mice showed differences in prepulse inhibition (PPI), which is a well-established endophenotype for SCZ. These results show that Tcf7l2 alters behavior in mice. Importantly, these differences are observed prior to the onset of detectable glucose metabolism abnormalities. Whether these differences are related to human anxiety-disorders or schizophrenia remains to be determined. These animal models have the potential to elucidate the molecular basis of psychiatric comorbidities in diabetes and should therefore be studied further.

22052079|t|Association analysis of 31 common polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes and its related traits in Indian sib pairs.
22052079|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Evaluation of the association of 31 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-beta cell function (HOMA-b), HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and type 2 diabetes in the Indian population. METHODS: We genotyped 3,089 sib pairs recruited in the Indian Migration Study from four cities in India (Lucknow, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Bangalore) for 31 SNPs in 24 genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes in European populations. We conducted within-sib-pair analysis for type 2 diabetes and its related quantitative traits. RESULTS: The risk-allele frequencies of all the SNPs were comparable with those reported in western populations. We demonstrated significant associations of CXCR4 (rs932206), CDKAL1 (rs7756992) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs12255372) with fasting glucose, with b values of 0.007 (p = 0.05), 0.01 (p = 0.01), 0.007 (p = 0.05), 0.01 (p = 0.003) and 0.08 (p = 0.01), respectively. Variants in NOTCH2 (rs10923931), TCF-2 (also known as HNF1B) (rs757210), ADAM30 (rs2641348) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661) significantly predicted fasting insulin, with b values of -0.06 (p = 0.04), 0.05 (p = 0.05), -0.08 (p = 0.01) and -0.08 (p = 0.02), respectively. For HOMA-IR, we detected associations with TCF-2, ADAM30 and CDKN2A/B, with b values of 0.05 (p = 0.04), -0.07 (p = 0.03) and -0.08 (p = 0.02), respectively. We also found significant associations of ADAM30 (b = -0.05; p = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (b = -0.05; p = 0.03) with HOMA-b. THADA variant (rs7578597) was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.04, 2.22; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We validated the association of seven established loci with intermediate traits related to type 2 diabetes in an Indian population using a design resistant to population stratification.

The aim of this study was to identify type 2 diabetes (T2D) cases and controls for a GWAS, using data captured through routine clinical care across five institutions using different electronic medical record (EMR) systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm was developed to identify T2D cases and controls based on a combination of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results. The performance of the algorithm was validated at three of the five participating institutions compared against clinician review. A GWAS was subsequently performed using cases and controls identified by the algorithm, with samples pooled across all five institutions. RESULTS: The algorithm achieved 98% and 100% positive predictive values for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as compared against clinician review. By standardizing and applying the algorithm across institutions, 3353 cases and 3352 controls were identified. Subsequent GWAS using data from five institutions replicated the TCF7L2 gene variant (rs7903146) previously associated with T2D. DISCUSSION: By applying stringent criteria to EMR data collected through routine clinical care, cases and controls for a GWAS were identified that subsequently replicated a known genetic variant. The use of standard terminologies to define data elements enabled pooling of subjects and data across five different institutions to achieve the robust numbers required for GWAS. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm using commonly available data from five different EMR can accurately identify T2D cases and controls for genetic study across multiple institutions.

22109281|t|The type 2 diabetes-associated variant in TCF7L2 is associated with latent autoimmune diabetes in adult Europeans and the gene effect is modified by obesity: a meta-analysis and an individual study.
22109281|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been proposed to be associated with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We sought to confirm the possible association in Europeans and to examine the interaction between one gene variant and clinical data. METHODS: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 C-to-T polymorphism was genotyped in 211 LADA, 1,297 type 2 diabetic, 545 type 1 diabetic and 1,497 control individuals from Hungary. A meta-analysis of our and previously published studies was performed to evaluate the size and the heterogeneity of the gene effect. RESULTS: The meta-analysis yielded a significant effect of TCF7L2 T allele (OR 1.28; p < 0.0001) on LADA risk without heterogeneity among Europeans. The T allele conferred equally strong susceptibility to LADA and type 2 diabetes. In the Hungarian dataset, the T allele was associated with LADA and type 2 diabetes, but not with type 1 diabetes. T allele carriers had significantly lower BMI than patients with the CC genotype in the LADA and type 2 diabetes groups (p = 0.0021 and p = 0.0013, respectively). In both diseases, the diabetes risk was significantly higher in the non-overweight than in the overweight BMI category (p = 0.0013 and p < 0.0001, respectively); susceptibility to LADA was increased by 2.84-fold in non-overweight individuals compared with overweight ones. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The meta-analysis demonstrates that TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is a population-independent susceptibility locus for LADA in Europeans. The effect size is similar for LADA and type 2 diabetes. The gene effect on diabetes risk may be modulated by BMI, such that the lower the BMI, the higher the gene effect.

22136959|t|rs12255372 variant of TCF7L2 gene is protective for obesity in Mexican children.
22136959|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in adults, but the association of TCF7L2 with weight-related traits and body fat in humans is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372) and obese phenotype in Mexican school-age children. METHODS: The study was performed in schools in Mexico City; 186 obese and 194 control children were studied. Fasting insulin and glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides concentration were determined. The variant rs12255372 of the TCF7L2 gene was genotyped. We used age- and sex-adjusted linear models to test for association with metabolic measurements with this variant. RESULTS: Genotype of the TCF7L2 rs12255372 gene was associated with lower fasting plasma glucose (p  = 0.001) and lower homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-R; p  = 0.001) in nonobese children. Heterozygous carriers for this variant were more prevalent in lean children (32.5%) than in the obese group (23.7%), which resulted in a strong protective effect for the normal weight condition (OR  = 0.56, 0.32-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 rs12255372 polymorphism protects Mexican children from obesity. Further research in other large, population-based studies is needed to replicate these findings.

24653947|t|Cumulative Effect of Common Genetic Variants Predicts Incident Type 2 Diabetes: A Study of 21,183 Subjects from Three Large Prospective Cohorts.
24653947|a|Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their meta-analyses have identified multiple genetic loci that are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Except for variants in the TCF7L2 gene which had a modest effect on diabetic risk, most genetic variants identified so far have only a weak association with diabetes. It is possible that the combination of multiple variants may have a larger effect on disease risk and improve risk prediction. In this study, we focus on SNPs that had been robustly replicated in previous GWAS and were also genotyped in a large sample of 21,183 participants from three large prospective cohorts, including Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Among these, we were able to successfully confirm the associations of 12 SNPs with baseline prevalent T2D in these two cohorts. A genotype risk score (GRS) using these12 risk variants was constructed to examine whether GRS predicts incident diabetes. In a combined meta-analysis, subjects in the highest tertile of GRS had a 1.62-fold increased risk of incident T2D (95% CI, 1.08-2.44, P=1.5*10-14) compared to those in the lowest tertile of GRS after adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking, body mass index (BMI), lipids (HDL and LDL) and systolic blood pressure. Moreover, GRS significantly improves risk prediction and reclassification in T2D beyond known risk factors.

22139555|t|Determining genetic risk factors for pediatric type 2 diabetes.
22139555|a|The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing significantly in the pediatric population. A strong family history of the disease suggests the involvement of genetic factors for diabetes development, but defining the molecular genetics of T2D in children is difficult due to a low number of subjects and the lack of robust diagnostic criteria. Thus, genetic studies of T2D have been carried out almost exclusively in adults. In this review, the genetics of T2D is summarized and options for discovering the missing heritability explored. The review concludes with a discussion of future research that will be required for determining genetic risk factors for pediatric T2D.

22151254|t|Genetic variants in potassium channels are associated with type 2 diabetes in a Mongolian population.
22151254|a|BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 common sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results are not always the same in populations with differing genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we evaluated a hypothesis that a North Asian population living in a geographic area with unusually harsh environmental conditions would develop unique genetic risks. METHODS: A population-based association study was performed with 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes selected according to the results of GWAS conducted in other populations. The study participants included 393 full-heritage Mongolian individuals (177 diagnosed with T2D and 216 matched controls). Genotyping was performed by TaqMan methodology. RESULTS: The strongest association was detected with SNPs located within the potassium channel-coding genes KCNQ1 (highest odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; P = 3.4 * 10(-5) ) and ABCC8 (OR = 1.79; P = 5 * 10(-4) ). Genetic variants identified as strongly influencing the risk of T2D in other populations (e.g. KCNJ11 or TCF7L2) did not show significant association in Mongolia. CONCLUSIONS:     The strongest T2D risk-associated SNPs in Mongolians are located within two of three tested potassium channel-coding genes. Accumulated variations in these genes may be related to the exposure to harsh environmental conditions.

22189546|t|Association between genetics of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and macrovascular complications: exploring a common ground hypothesis.
22189546|a|Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) are conditions that cause a substantial public health burden. Since both conditions often coexist in the same individual, it has been hypothesized that they have a common effector. Insulin and hyperglycemia are assumed to play critical roles in this scenario. In recent years, many genetic risk factors for both diabetes and CAD have been discovered, mainly through genome-wide association studies. Genetic aspects of diabetes, diabetic macrovascular complications, and CAD are assumed to have intersections leading to the common effector hypothesis. However, only a few genetic risk factors could be identified that modulate the risk for both conditions. Polymorphisms in TCF7L2 and near the CDKN2A/B genes seem to be of great importance in this regard since they appear to modulate both conditions, and they are not necessarily related to insulinism, or hyperglycemia, for CAD development. Other issues related to this hypothesis, such as the problems of phenotype heterogeneity, are also of interest. Recent studies have contributed to a better understanding of the complex genetics of diabetic macrovascular complications. Much effort is still needed to clarify the associations in the genetics of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. At present, there is little genetic evidence to support a common effector hypothesis, other than insulin or hyperglycemia, for the association between these conditions.

22245614|t|Genetic variants of TCF7L2 are associated with type 2 diabetes in a northeastern Chinese population.
22245614|a|Variants in the gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in several ethnic groups. Two intronic variants, rs290487 and rs11196218, were originally identified as T2D modifiers in Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwan Chinese populations, respectively. However, discrepancies were noted in subsequent replicated studies. In this study, an association of these two loci with T2D was investigated in a Harbin Chinese population. Whereas the two populations in the initial studies were southern Han Chinese, Harbin Chinese are from northeastern China. The SNPs rs290487 and rs11196218 were genotyped by ligase detection reactions in 700 T2D patients and 570 unrelated non-diabetic controls. Association analyses, which were carried out using the case-control sample set, yielded a significant association between rs290487 and T2D, with a trend opposite to that described in a previous report. Specifically, rs290487T was found to be significantly associated with disease susceptibility (p=0.039), and the allelic OR of rs290487T carriers was 1.184 (95% CI 1.008-1.391). There was no significant association between rs11196218 and T2D. Taken together, TCF7L2 may be an important susceptibility gene for T2D in some Chinese populations. The discrepancies in the allelic associations determined for northern vs. southern Chinese allude to the presence of genetic variation among the Han Chinese.

22247771|t|Association of the type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility gene, TCF7L2, with schizophrenia in an Arab-Israeli family sample.
22247771|a|Many reports in different populations have demonstrated linkage of the 10q24-q26 region to schizophrenia, thus encouraging further analysis of this locus for detection of specific schizophrenia genes. Our group previously reported linkage of the 10q24-q26 region to schizophrenia in a unique, homogeneous sample of Arab-Israeli families with multiple schizophrenia-affected individuals, under a dominant model of inheritance. To further explore this candidate region and identify specific susceptibility variants within it, we performed re-analysis of the 10q24-26 genotype data, taken from our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Alkelai et al, 2011). We analyzed 2089 SNPs in an extended sample of 57 Arab Israeli families (189 genotyped individuals), under the dominant model of inheritance, which best fits this locus according to previously performed MOD score analysis. We found significant association with schizophrenia of the TCF7L2 gene intronic SNP, rs12573128, (p=7.01 10      ) and of the nearby intergenic SNP, rs1033772, (p=6.59 10      ) which is positioned between TCF7L2 and HABP2. TCF7L2 is one of the best confirmed susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes (T2D) among different ethnic groups, has a role in pancreatic beta cell function and may contribute to the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2D. These preliminary results independently support previous findings regarding a possible role of TCF7L2 in susceptibility to schizophrenia, and strengthen the importance of integrating linkage analysis models of inheritance while performing association analyses in regions of interest. Further validation studies in additional populations are required.

22258190|t|[Perspectives on the contribution of genetics to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus].
22258190|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic-endocrine disorder often associated with overweight or obesity. It is a complex disease determined by both predisposing genetic factors and non-genetic environmental factors and interactions between them, leading to impaired beta-cell insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a prominent feature of most patients with type 2 DM and obesity, resulting in a reduced response of target tissues (muscle, liver and fat) to both endogenous and exogenous insulin. There is considerable evidence that heredity is a major contributor to the insulin resistance of type 2 DM. Initially, among those destined to develop diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas compensate with increased insulin secretion to maintain normal glucose tolerance. Type 2 DM develops when beta cells fail to compensate. Despite of the numerous studies in the recent years, the actual genetic causes of insulin resistance and type 2 DM have not yet been clearly elucidated. Through linkage and "genome-wide" studies, genes were identified most frequently associated with type 2 DM, such as TCF7L2, considered, until recently, the most important gene among those predisposing to type 2 DM. On the other hand, numerous candidate genes have been analyzed for genetic variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 DM. Several variants have been identified in many of these genes, including the insulin receptor gene, INSR, and other genes involved in adipogenesis and beta-cell insulin secretion. In this context, recently our group has identified a new gene involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 DM: the HMGA1 gene. Functional genetic variants of the HMGA1 gene, capable of reducing the intracellular levels of INSR in insulin target tissues, were found in 10% of patients with type 2 DM in three distinct populations: Italian, North American and French.

22275441|t|Genetic risk assessment of type 2 diabetes-associated polymorphisms in African Americans.
22275441|a|OBJECTIVE: Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility have been identified in predominantly European-derived populations. These SNPs have not been extensively investigated for individual and cumulative effects on T2D risk in African Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Seventeen index T2D risk variants were genotyped in 2,652 African American case subjects with T2D and 1,393 nondiabetic control subjects. Individual SNPs and cumulative risk allele loads were assessed for association with risk for T2D. Cumulative risk was assessed by counting risk alleles and evaluating the difference in cumulative risk scores between case subjects and control subjects. A second analysis weighted risk scores (ln [OR]) based on previously reported European-derived effect sizes. RESULTS: Frequencies of risk alleles ranged from 8.6 to 99.9%. Eleven SNPs had ORs >1, and 5 from ADAMTS9, WFS1, CDKAL1, JAZF1, and TCF7L2 trended or had nominally significant evidence of T2D association (P < 0.05). Individuals carried between 13 and 29 risk alleles. Association was observed between T2D and increase in risk allele load (unweighted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.01-1.08], P = 0.010; weighted 1.06 [1.03-1.10], P = 8.10   10(-5)). When TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 was included as a covariate, the risk score was no longer associated with T2D in either model (unweighted 1.02 [0.98-1.05], P = 0.33; weighted 1.02 [0.98-1.06], P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: The trend of increase in risk for T2D with increasing risk allele load is similar to observations in European-derived populations; however, these analyses indicate that T2D genetic risk is primarily mediated through the effect of TCF7L2 in African Americans.

22296403|t|Common variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with reduced insulin secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
22296403|a|Common variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene were identified as one of the few genetic polymorphisms with powerful effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Given the genetic overlap between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and T2D, the present study was undertaken to investigate whether the TCF7L2 variants are also associated with PCOS. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11196218 and rs290487 of the TCF7L2 gene, which showed robust associations with T2D in Chinese population, in 430 PCOS patients and 360 control subjects by pyrosequencing, and also assessed the effect of genotype on clinical and biochemical traits in the PCOS group. We found no evidence for association between SNP rs11196218 and PCOS. The SNP rs290487 showed marginal differences in genotype frequencies between the PCOS and control group, with the minor C allele being the at-risk allele for PCOS. In PCOS women, the C allele carriers of rs290487 had higher levels of 2h blood glucose but lower insulinogenic index than noncarriers, suggesting impaired insulin secretion. Our data suggested that the TCF7L2 variants may confer an increased risk for early impairment of glucose homeostasis in PCOS.

22301903|t|Association of fibrillin-3 and transcription factor-7-like 2 gene variants with metabolic phenotypes in PCOS.
22301903|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex genetic disease characterized by heritable reproductive and metabolic abnormalities. Genetic variants associated with the reproductive phenotype have been mapped to the fibrillin-3 (FBN3) gene and to a novel transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) locus (rs11196236 G). The association of these genetic variants with metabolic phenotypes was investigated in 31 PCOS and 18 control women of European ancestry. The insulinogenic index during an oral glucose tolerance test (/\I30//\G30) and insulin secretion rates at the maximal dose during a graded-glucose infusion (ISRmax) were used as indexes of insulin secretion. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin sensitivity (M/I) were determined during a euglycemic clamp. The disposition index (DI) was calculated using M/I and /\I30//\G30 or ISRmax. Compared with noncarriers (n = 10) and control (n = 10), M/I was decreased (P = 1.1   10(-5)) in heterozygous and homozygous PCOS carriers (n = 14) of rs11196236 G and this variant predicted M/I (partial r(2) = 0.34, P = 0.005) in a regression analysis. Postabsorptive EGP tended to be higher (P = 0.040) in heterozygous and homozygous PCOS carriers of the FBN3-associated allele (n = 12), allele 8 of D19S884 (FBN3(+)), compared to PCOS noncarriers (n = 19). PCOS carriers of the rs12255372 T (TCF7L2 Caucasian type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) locus) had no significant associated metabolic phenotypes. We conclude that rs11196236 G TCF7L2 variant is associated with peripheral insulin resistance in PCOS but this effect is not seen in control women. The FBN3 risk allele may be associated with changes in basal glucose homeostasis in PCOS. These findings require replication in additional PCOS cohorts.

22307069|t|Association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci with one-year weight loss in the look AHEAD clinical trial.
22307069|a|The importance of lifestyle intervention for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been underscored by the limited benefit of pharmacologic therapies. We sought to determine whether genetic variants that contribute to T2D risk modify the response of weight and waist circumference to an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in patients with obesity and T2D. Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) is a randomized clinical trial comparing an ILI with a control condition on the risk of cardiovascular disease in overweight adults with T2D. We analyzed 28 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at/near 17 T2D-susceptibility genes in 3,903 consented participants. We genetically characterized the cohort by assessing whether T2D-susceptibility loci were overrepresented compared with a nondiabetic community-based cohort (N = 1,016). We evaluated the association of individual variants and a composite genetic risk score (GRS) with anthropometric traits at baseline and after 1-year of intervention. Look AHEAD subjects carried more T2D-susceptibility alleles than the control population. At baseline, TCF7L2 risk alleles and the highest GRS were associated with lower BMI and waist circumference. Nominally significant genotype-by-intervention interactions were detected for 1-year change in waist circumference with JAZF1, MTNR1B, and IRS1, and BMI with JAZF1. Highest GRS was associated with a greater reduction in waist circumference at year 1, although the variance in change attributable to the GRS was small. This study shows that the genetic burden associated with T2D risk does not undermine the effect of lifestyle intervention and suggests the existence of additional genomic regions, distinct from the T2D-susceptibility loci, which may enhance or mitigate weight loss.

22325160|t|Large-scale gene-centric meta-analysis across 39 studies identifies type 2 diabetes loci.
22325160|a|To identify genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2D), we performed large-scale meta-analyses by using a custom    50,000 SNP genotyping array (the ITMAT-Broad-CARe array) with    2000 candidate genes in 39 multiethnic population-based studies, case-control studies, and clinical trials totaling 17,418 cases and 70,298 controls. First, meta-analysis of 25 studies comprising 14,073 cases and 57,489 controls of European descent confirmed eight established T2D loci at genome-wide significance. In silico follow-up analysis of putative association signals found in independent genome-wide association studies (including 8,130 cases and 38,987 controls) performed by the DIAGRAM consortium identified a T2D locus at genome-wide significance (GATAD2A/CILP2/PBX4; p = 5.7 * 10(-9)) and two loci exceeding study-wide significance (SREBF1, and TH/INS; p < 2.4 * 10(-6)). Second, meta-analyses of 1,986 cases and 7,695 controls from eight African-American studies identified study-wide-significant (p = 2.4 * 10(-7)) variants in HMGA2 and replicated variants in TCF7L2 (p = 5.1 * 10(-15)). Third, conditional analysis revealed multiple known and novel independent signals within five T2D-associated genes in samples of European ancestry and within HMGA2 in African-American samples. Fourth, a multiethnic meta-analysis of all 39 studies identified T2D-associated variants in BCL2 (p = 2.1 * 10(-8)). Finally, a composite genetic score of SNPs from new and established T2D signals was significantly associated with increased risk of diabetes in African-American, Hispanic, and Asian populations. In summary, large-scale meta-analysis involving a dense gene-centric approach has uncovered additional loci and variants that contribute to T2D risk and suggests substantial overlap of T2D association signals across multiple ethnic groups.

22361517|t|Genetic determinants of the ankle-brachial index: a meta-analysis of a cardiovascular candidate gene 50K SNP panel in the candidate gene association resource (CARe) consortium.
22361517|a|BACKGROUND: Candidate gene association studies for peripheral artery disease (PAD), including subclinical disease assessed with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), have been limited by the modest number of genes examined. We conducted a two stage meta-analysis of    50,000 SNPs across    2100 candidate genes to identify genetic variants for ABI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied subjects of European ancestry from 8 studies (n=21,547, 55% women, mean age 44-73 years) and African American ancestry from 5 studies (n=7267, 60% women, mean age 41-73 years) involved in the candidate gene association resource (CARe) consortium. In each ethnic group, additive genetic models were used (with each additional copy of the minor allele corresponding to the given beta) to test each SNP for association with continuous ABI (excluding ABI>1.40) and PAD (defined as ABI<0.90) using linear or logistic regression with adjustment for known PAD risk factors and population stratification. We then conducted a fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analyses considering a p<2*10(-6) to denote statistical significance. RESULTS: In the European ancestry discovery meta-analyses, rs2171209 in SYTL3 (b=-0.007, p=6.02*10(-7)) and rs290481 in TCF7L2 (b=-0.008, p=7.01*10(-7)) were significantly associated with ABI. None of the SNP associations for PAD were significant, though a SNP in CYP2B6 (p=4.99*10(-5)) was among the strongest associations. These 3 genes are linked to key PAD risk factors (lipoprotein(a), type 2 diabetes, and smoking behavior, respectively). We sought replication in 6 population-based and 3 clinical samples (n=15,440) for rs290481 and rs2171209. However, in the replication stage (rs2171209, p=0.75; rs290481, p=0.19) and in the combined discovery and replication analysis the SNP-ABI associations were no longer significant (rs2171209, p=1.14*10(-3); rs290481, p=8.88*10(-5)). In African Americans, none of the SNP associations for ABI or PAD achieved an experiment-wide level of significance. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic determinants of ABI and PAD remain elusive. Follow-up of these preliminary findings may uncover important biology given the known gene-risk factor associations. New and more powerful approaches to PAD gene discovery are warranted.

22377712|t|Association between type 2 diabetes genetic susceptibility loci and visceral and subcutaneous fat area as determined by computed tomography.
22377712|a|Visceral fat accumulation has an important role in the development of several metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. New genetic loci that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes have been identified by genome-wide association studies. To examine the association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci and visceral fat accumulation, we genotyped 1279 Japanese subjects (556 men and 723 women), who underwent computed tomography for measurements of visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) for the following single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): NOTCH2 rs10923931, THADA rs7578597, PPARG rs1801282, ADAMTS9 rs4607103, IGF2BP2 rs1470579, VEGFA rs9472138, JAZF1 rs864745, CDKN2A/CDKN2B rs564398 and rs10811661, HHEX rs1111875 and rs5015480, TCF7L2 rs7901695, KCNQ1 rs2237892, KCNJ11 rs5215 and rs5219, EXT2 rs1113132, rs11037909, and rs3740878, MTNR1B rs10830963, DCD rs1153188, TSPAN8/LGR5 rs7961581, and FTO rs8050136 and rs9939609. None of the above SNPs were significantly associated with VFA. The FTO rs8050136 and rs9939609 risk alleles exhibited significant associations with body mass index (BMI; P=0.00088 and P=0.0010, respectively) and SFA (P=0.00013 and P=0.00017, respectively). No other SNPs were significantly associated with BMI or SFA. Our results suggest that two SNPs in the FTO gene are associated with subcutaneous fat accumulation. The contributions of other SNPs are inconclusive because of a limitation of the sample power.

22377714|t|Impact of common type 2 diabetes risk gene variants on future type 2 diabetes in the non-diabetic population in Korea.
22377714|a|We prospectively examined the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progression and common T2DM-risk gene variants in 870 non-diabetic participants in a Chungju Metabolic Disease Cohort Study in Korea. We genotyped the following six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): KCNQ1 (potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily member 1) rs2237892, CDKAL1 (regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1) rs7554840, CDKN2A/B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B) rs1081161, SCL30A8 (solute carrier family 30 member 8 gene) rs13266634, TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) rs7903146, and PPARG (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) rs1801282. Anthropometric data and metabolic parameters were obtained at baseline and year 4. Pancreatic b cell function was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment index of b cells (HOMA-b). After 4 years, 137 subjects developed T2DM (15.7%). A significant association was found in the variant of KCNQ1 rs2237892, whereas the SNPs of CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, SCL30A8, TCF7L2 and PPARG were not associated. The C-allele carriers of KCNQ1 conferred a significantly increased risk for T2DM compared with the T/T genotype, independently of clinical risk factors (odds ratio=2.61, 95% confidence intervals=1.02-6.69, P=0.04). Although no differences were observed at baseline among the KCNQ1 variants, HOMA-b levels by year 4 were significantly lower in the C-allele carriers after controlling for metabolic parameters. The genetic variations in KCNQ1 are associated with future development of T2DM in Koreans, which might be mediated by differences in insulin secretory function.

22402060|t|Functional analysis of TCF7L2 genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes.
22402060|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Common non-coding variations within the TCF7L2 locus have a strong influence on type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility through uncharacterised mechanisms. An islet-specific functional polymorphism has been identified, although this does not explain the association between genotype and gene expression in other cell types. This study sought to identify these other functional TCF7L2 variants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Alternative splicing and gene expression from TCF7L2 was examined from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 100 healthy Caucasians using two T2D-associated SNPs, rs7903146 and rs12255372. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase reporter assays were performed with these SNPs and those in strong LD to determine potential SNP functionality. Individuals homozygous for rs7903146 and rs12255372 T2D risk alleles (TT/TT) expressed 2.6-fold greater levels of TCF7L2 mRNA compared to individuals homozygous for the non-risk alleles (CC/GG, p = 0.006), although differentially spliced TCF7L2 transcripts did not differ by T2D risk-associated genotype. From SNPs identified to be in strong LD with the T2D-associated SNPs, rs7903146 and rs12255372, five (rs4132670, rs4506565, rs7903146, rs7901695, rs17747324) demonstrated allele-specific binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). In luciferase reporter assays, rs4132670 exhibited 1.3-fold higher levels of enhancer activity in the Huh7 cell line (p = 3.8 * 10(-5)) and 2-fold higher levels in a WiDr colon carcinoma cell line (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rs4132670, located in a region of chromatin accessibility, is a non-tissue-specific candidate functional SNP that has the potential to play a role in TCF7L2 gene expression and T2D risk.

22406741|t|Genetic origins of low birth weight.
22406741|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Smaller size at birth is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in later life, but the mechanisms behind this association are poorly understood. Genetic variants which influence susceptibility to type 2 diabetes via effects on insulin secretion or action are good candidates for association with birth weight because foetal insulin is a key foetal growth factor. This review will focus on recent progress in identifying associations between common genetic variants and birth weight. RECENT FINDINGS: Foetal genetic variants at two loci (near CCNL1 and in ADCY5) were robustly associated with birth weight via the foetal genotype in the first genome-wide association study of birth weight. The birth weight-lowering allele at ADCY5 also predisposes to type 2 diabetes. In addition, evidence from studies of other type 2 diabetes loci is accumulating for association between the foetal risk alleles at CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE and lower birth weight, and the maternal risk alleles at GCK and TCF7L2 and higher birth weight. SUMMARY: The associations with birth weight at ADCY5, CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE support the foetal insulin hypothesis, which proposed that type 2 diabetes and lower birth weight could be two phenotypes of the same genotype. The associations at GCK and TCF7L2 illustrate that maternal genes are also important determinants of birth weight.

22419714|t|Effect of type 2 diabetes predisposing genetic variants on colorectal cancer risk.
22419714|a|BACKGROUND: The link between colorectal cancer (CRC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has been extensively studied. Although it is commonly accepted that T2D is a risk factor for CRC, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Given that the genetic background contributes to both traits, it is conceivable that genetic variants associated with T2D may also influence the risk of CRC. We selected 26 T2D-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) previously identified by genome-wide association studies and assessed their association with CRC and their interaction with known risk factors (gender, T2D, and body mass index) of CRC. Selected SNP were genotyped in 1798 CRC cases and 1810 controls from the population-based Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verh  tung durch Screening (DACHS) study (Germany). RESULTS: Patients carrying the TCF7L2_rs7903146_T allele had an increased risk of CRC (P(trend) = 0.02), whereas patients harboring the IL13_rs20541_T allele had a reduced risk (P(trend) = 0.02). A further analysis revealed gender-specific effects: the TCF7L2_rs7903146_T allele was associated with an increased risk of CRC in women (P(trend) = 0.003) but not in men (P(interaction) = 0.06); the LTA_rs1041981_A allele was associated with a decreased risk for CRC in women (P(trend) = 0.02), with an opposite effect in men (P(trend) = 0.05; P(interaction) = 0.002); the CDKAL1_rs7754840_C allele was associated with a decreased risk for CRC in men (P(trend) = 0.03), with no effect in women (P(interaction) = 0.03). The risk associated with the presence of T2D was modified both by IGF2BP2_rs4402960 and PPARy_rs1801282 SNP (P(interaction) = 0.04 and 0.04, respectively). None of the findings were significant after correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that T2D-related variants modify CRC risk independently and/or in an interactive manner according to the gender and the presence or absence of T2D.

22441719|t|Stronger association of common variants in TCF7L2 gene with nonobese type 2 diabetes in the Latvian population.
22441719|a|Polymorphisms in the gene coding for transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) are recognized as the strongest common genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D) across multiple ethnicities. This study was conducted to evaluate an association between TCF7L2 variants and diabetes susceptibility in the population of Latvia. We genotyped 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372 in 1   093 controls and 1   043 diabetic subjects. Association with T2D was found for 3 SNPs rs7901695, rs7903146 and rs12255372 in the whole sample (under an additive genetic model, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) were 1.26, 95% CI [1.08-1.48], P=0.003; OR=1.32, 95% CI [1.12-1.55], P=0.001 and OR=1.35, 95% CI [1.15-1.60], P=0.0004 respectively). In addition observed effects on T2D susceptibility for analysed SNPs were higher among subjects with BMI under 30   kg/m  . The impact of TCF7L2 variation on T2D risk in Latvian population is compatible with that demonstrated by a range of studies conducted in various ethnic groups.

22443257|t|Polycystic ovary syndrome is not associated with polymorphisms of the TCF7L2, CDKAL1, HHEX, KCNJ11, FTO and SLC30A8 genes.
22443257|a|OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance is a core feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Recently, genome-wide association studies have reported a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with reproducible associations and susceptibilities to type 2 diabetes. We examined the potential association between the diabetogenic genes uncovered in the genome-wide association studies and PCOS in Korean women. DESIGN: Case-control study. PATIENTS: Women with or without PCOS. MEASUREMENTS: DNA samples from 377 patients with PCOS and 386 age-matched controls were genotyped. RESULTS: None of the 12 SNPs in the six genes (KCNJ11, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO and CDKAL1) uncovered in the genome-wide association studies were associated with PCOS. For further analysis, the patients with PCOS were divided into two or three subgroups according to genotype, and the associations between the genotypes and insulin resistance or insulin secretory capacity were assessed. No SNPs were significantly associated with HOMA-IR, HOMA (bcell) (%), or 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test insulin levels in the patients with PCOS; there were no significant associations with other serum hormonal and metabolic markers, such as androgen or glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the six type 2 diabetes-associated genes identified in genome-wide association studies are not associated with PCOS.

22461567|t|Diabetes-associated common genetic variation and its association with GLP-1 concentrations and response to exogenous GLP-1.
22461567|a|The mechanisms by which common genetic variation predisposes to type 2 diabetes remain unclear. The disease-associated variants in TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and WFS1 (rs10010131) have been shown to affect response to exogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), while variants in KCNQ1 (rs151290, rs2237892, and rs2237895) alter endogenous GLP-1 secretion. We set out to validate these observations using a model of GLP-1-induced insulin secretion. We studied healthy individuals using a hyperglycemic clamp and GLP-1 infusion. In addition, we measured active and total GLP-1 in response to an oral challenge in nondiabetic subjects. After genotyping the relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms, generalized linear regression models and repeated-measures ANCOVA models incorporating potential confounders, such as age and BMI, were used to assess the associations, if any, of response with genotype. These variants did not alter GLP-1 concentrations in response to oral intake. No effects on b-cell responsiveness to hyperglycemia and GLP-1 infusion were apparent. Diabetes-associated variation (T allele at rs7903146) in TCF7L2 may impair the ability of hyperglycemia to suppress glucagon (45    2 vs. 47    2 vs. 60    5 ng/L for CC, CT, and TT, respectively, P = 0.02).

22463974|t|European genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes in North African Arabs.
22463974|a|AIMS: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and previous approaches have identified many genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in populations of European descent, but their contribution in Arab populations from North Africa is unknown. Our study aimed to validate these markers and to assess their combined effects, using large case-control studies of Moroccan and Tunisian individuals. METHODS: Overall, 44 polymorphisms, located at 37 validated European loci, were first analyzed in 1055 normoglycaemic controls and 1193 T2D cases from Morocco. Associations and trends were then assessed in 942 normoglycaemic controls and 1446 T2D cases from Tunisia. Finally, their ability to discriminate cases from controls was evaluated. RESULTS: Carrying a genetic variant in BCL11A, ADAMTS9, IGF2BP2, WFS1, CDKAL1, TP53INP1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, HNF1A, FTO, MC4R and GCK increased the risk of T2D when assessing the Moroccan and Tunisian samples together. Each additional risk allele increased the susceptibility for developing the disease by 12% (P = 9.0   10(-9)). Genotype information for 13 polymorphisms slightly improved the classification of North Africans with and without T2D, as assessed by clinical parameters, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.64 to 0.67 (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In addition to TCF7L2, 12 additional loci were found to be shared between Europeans and North African Arabs. As for Europeans, the reliability of genetic testing based on these markers to determine the risk for T2D is low. More genome-wide studies, including next-generation sequencing, in North African populations are needed to identify the genetic variants responsible for ethnic disparities in T2D susceptibility.

22474656|t|Microsatellite markers for linkage and association studies.
22474656|a|During the 1990s and the first several years of this century, microsatellites or short tandem repeats were the workhorse genetic markers for hypothesis-independent studies in human genetics, facilitating genome-wide linkage studies and allelic imbalance studies. However, the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms led to the era of the SNP for genome scans. Nevertheless, it is important to note that microsatellites remain highly informative and useful measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage in complementing SNPs lies in their greater allelic diversity than biallelic SNPs as well as in their population history, in which single-step expansion or contraction of the tandem repeat on the background of ancestral SNP haplotypes can break up common haplotypes, leading to greater haplotype diversity within the linkage disequilibrium block of interest. In fact, microsatellites have starred in association studies leading to widely replicated discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region). At the end of the day, it will be important to catalog all variation, including SNPs, microsatellites, copy number variations, and polymorphic inversions in human genetic studies. This article describes the utilities of microsatellites and experimental approaches in their use.

22480428|t|T2D risk haplotypes of the TCF7L2 gene in the Czech population sample: the association with free fatty acids composition.
22480428|a|The association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants with the pathogenesis of T2D, gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was examined. The study involved 1460 individuals: 347 T2D patients (D); 261 gestational diabetics (G); 147 offspring of T2D (O); 329 women with PCOS, and 376 controls (C). The SNPs: rs7901695; rs7903146; rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene were genotyped. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters, oGTT derived indices were assessed. In addition, free fatty acids (FFAs) were evaluated in 183 non-diabetic women. The CTT haplotype showed the strongest association with T2D with OR 1.57, p=0.0003. The frequency of the CTT/CTT haplotype was decreasing in following order: D 10.6, O 9.5, G 6.1, C 5.3 and PCOS 4.9 [%]. Among CTT carriers, significantly decreased levels of oGTT-stimulated insulin and C-peptide as well as proportions of fasting PUFAs were observed. The carriership of CTG/TCG was associated with gestational diabetes, OR 2.59, p=0.036. The association of TCF7L2 haplotypes with T2D and gestational diabetes but not with PCOS was confirmed. Novel association of TCF7L2 with FFAs composition was found.

22487833|t|[Association analysis of genetic polymorphisms of TCF7L2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX genes and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus].
22487833|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, HHEX with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and nephropathy (DN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A total of 479 subjects with DR,248 with DN and 650 without DR or DN were recruited to assess the associations between SNPs of TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs6585205, rs11196218), CDKAL1 (rs10946398,rs4712527), SLC30A8 (rs13266634, rs3802177, rs11558471) and HHEX (rs1111875, rs7923837) and the development of DR and DN. RESULTS: There were significant differences in genotypic and allele frequencies of rs11558471 (SLC30A8) between DR and control groups (P< 0.05), the odds ratio (OR) values of A and AA were 1.27 and 1.68. The distributions of genotype and allele frequency for rs11196218 (TCF7L2) were significantly different between DN and control group (P=0.0051,OR=1.37). However, the P value after Bonferroni correction showed no significant difference. No significant differences were found in the distributions of rs13266634 and rs3802177 (SLC30A8), rs10946398 (CDKAL1), rs6585205, rs7903146 and rs11196218 (TCF7L2) and rs7923837 (HHEX) between DR and control groups, and nor significant differences were found in distributions of rs6585205 (TCF7L2), rs4712527 (CDKAL1), rs13266634, rs3802177 and rs11558471 (SLC30A8), and 7923837 (HHEX) between DN and control groups, though for all comparison the OR values were greater than 1. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 genes may be associated with the development of DR and DN, respectively. Association between the polymorphisms of CKDAL1, TCF7L2 and HHEX genes and DR, and between the polymorphisms of SLC30A8, HHEX and CDKAL1 genes and DN, cannot be excluded.

22492527|t|Reduced insulin exocytosis in human pancreatic b-cells with gene variants linked to type 2 diabetes.
22492527|a|The majority of genetic risk variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D) affect insulin secretion, but the mechanisms through which they influence pancreatic islet function remain largely unknown. We functionally characterized human islets to determine secretory, biophysical, and ultrastructural features in relation to genetic risk profiles in diabetic and nondiabetic donors. Islets from donors with T2D exhibited impaired insulin secretion, which was more pronounced in lean than obese diabetic donors. We assessed the impact of 14 disease susceptibility variants on measures of glucose sensing, exocytosis, and structure. Variants near TCF7L2 and ADRA2A were associated with reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas susceptibility variants near ADRA2A, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, and TCF7L2 were associated with reduced depolarization-evoked insulin exocytosis. KCNQ1, ADRA2A, KCNJ11, HHEX/IDE, and SLC2A2 variants affected granule docking. We combined our results to create a novel genetic risk score for b-cell dysfunction that includes aberrant granule docking, decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity of exocytosis, and reduced insulin release. Individuals with a high risk score displayed an impaired response to intravenous glucose and deteriorating insulin secretion over time. Our results underscore the importance of defects in b-cell exocytosis in T2D and demonstrate the potential of cellular phenotypic characterization in the elucidation of complex genetic disorders.

22498248|t|Is genetic testing useful to predict type 2 diabetes?
22498248|a|The early identification of individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) enables prevention. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have added at least 40 genetic variants to the list of already well characterized T2D risk predictors, including family history, obesity, and elevated fasting plasma glucose levels. Although these variants can significantly predict T2D alone and as a part of genotype risk scores, they do not yet offer clinical discrimination beyond that achieved with common clinical measurements. Future progress on at least two research fronts may improve the predictive performance of genotype information. First, expanded GWAS efforts in non-European populations will allow targeted sequencing of risk loci and the identification of true causal variants. Second, studies with longer prediction time horizons may demonstrate that genotype information performs better than clinical risk predictors over a longer period of the life course. At present, however, genetic testing cannot be recommended for clinical T2D risk prediction in adults.

22513821|t|The association of genetic variants of type 2 diabetes with kidney function.
22513821|a|Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent and is the major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease in American Indians. Genome-wide association studies identified several loci associated with diabetes but their impact on susceptibility to diabetic complications is unknown. We studied the association of 18 type 2 diabetes genome-wide association single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; MDRD equation) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in 6958 Strong Heart Study family and cohort participants. Center-specific residuals of eGFR and log urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, obtained from linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index, were regressed onto SNP dosage using variance component models in family data and linear regression in unrelated individuals. Estimates were then combined across centers. Four diabetic loci were associated with eGFR and one locus with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A SNP in the WFS1 gene (rs10010131) was associated with higher eGFR in younger individuals and with increased albuminuria. SNPs in the FTO, KCNJ11, and TCF7L2 genes were associated with lower eGFR, but not albuminuria, and were not significant in prospective analyses. Our findings suggest a shared genetic risk for type 2 diabetes and its kidney complications, and a potential role for WFS1 in early-onset diabetic nephropathy in American Indian populations.

22524208|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 gene polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus.
22524208|a|OBJECTIVE: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms were shown to be associated with insulin resistance. We examined two single nucleotide exchanges in this gene in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in women with normal glucose tolerance. METHODS: A total of 1800 unselected women were prospectively screened for GDM by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Two hundred and fifty Caucasian women of this collective, 125 patients with pathological OGTT and 125 patients with normal glucose tolerance were randomly selected. DNA samples were isolated and TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms (TCF7L2rs12255372 and TCF7L2rs7903146) were analyzed. RESULTS: Women with GDM were significantly older (30.1    3.4 years vs. 28.2    4.8 years, p = 0.01), had a significantly higher body mass index (26.4 kg/m(2); interquartile range: 23.33-31.19 vs. 24.6 kg/m(2); interquartile range: 21.05-27.28, p = 0.02) and were significantly more often homozygous for the T allele of TCF7L2rs12255372 (17.2% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.002) than patients with normal glucose tolerance. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the homozygous variant of TCF7L2rs12255372 (T/T) is an independent risk factor for GDM (OR 7.7, 95% CI: 1.71-34.60), but not the homozygous variant of TCF7L2rs7903146 (T/T). CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2rs12255372 variant (T/T) is associated with increased risk of GDM in Caucasian women.

22529894|t|Amerind ancestry, socioeconomic status and the genetics of type 2 diabetes in a Colombian population.
22529894|a|The "thrifty genotype" hypothesis proposes that the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Native Americans and admixed Latin Americans has a genetic basis and reflects an evolutionary adaptation to a past low calorie/high exercise lifestyle. However, identification of the gene variants underpinning this hypothesis remains elusive. Here we assessed the role of Native American ancestry, socioeconomic status (SES) and 21 candidate gene loci in susceptibility to T2D in a sample of 876 T2D cases and 399 controls from Antioquia (Colombia). Although mean Native American ancestry is significantly higher in T2D cases than in controls (32% v 29%), this difference is confounded by the correlation of ancestry with SES, which is a stronger predictor of disease status. Nominally significant association (P<0.05) was observed for markers in: TCF7L2, RBMS1, CDKAL1, ZNF239, KCNQ1 and TCF1 and a significant bias (P<0.05) towards OR>1 was observed for markers selected from previous T2D genome-wide association studies, consistent with a role for Old World variants in susceptibility to T2D in Latin Americans. No association was found to the only known Native American-specific gene variant previously associated with T2D in a Mexican sample (rs9282541 in ABCA1). An admixture mapping scan with 1,536 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) did not identify genome regions with significant deviation of ancestry in Antioquia. Exclusion analysis indicates that this scan rules out ~95% of the genome as harboring loci with ancestry risk ratios >1.22 (at P < 0.05).

22552033|t|Influence of dietary protein intake and glycemic index on the association between TCF7L2 HapA and weight gain.
22552033|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes and BMI. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether TCF7L2 HapA is associated with weight development and whether such an association is modulated by protein intake or by the glycemic index (GI). DESIGN: The investigation was based on prospective data from 5 cohort studies nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Weight change was followed up for a mean (  SD) of 6.8    2.5 y. TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs10885406 were successfully genotyped in 11,069 individuals and used to derive HapA. Multiple logistic and linear regression analysis was applied to test for the main effect of HapA and its interaction with dietary protein or GI. Analyses from the cohorts were combined by random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: HapA was associated neither with baseline BMI (0.03    0.07 BMI units per allele; P = 0.6) nor with annual weight change (8.8    11.7 g/y per allele; P = 0.5). However, a previously shown positive association between intake of protein, particularly of animal origin, and subsequent weight change in this population proved to be attenuated by TCF7L2 HapA (P-interaction = 0.01). We showed that weight gain becomes independent of protein intake with an increasing number of HapA alleles. Substitution of protein with either fat or carbohydrates showed the same effects. No interaction with GI was observed. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 HapA attenuates the positive association between animal protein intake and long-term body weight change in middle-aged Europeans but does not interact with the GI of the diet.

22558147|t|Lack of association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genotypes and body weight on the development of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes.
22558147|a|AIM: To investigate whether type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes and body weight influence the development of islet autoantibodies and the rate of progression to type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Genotyping for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, FTO, HHEX-IDE, HMGA2, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, MTNR1B, PPARG, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 was obtained in 1350 children from parents with type 1 diabetes participating in the BABYDIAB study. Children were prospectively followed from birth for islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes. Data on weight and height were obtained at 9 months, 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years of age. RESULTS: None of type 2 diabetes risk alleles at the CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, FTO, HHEX-IDE, HMGA2, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, MTNR1B, PPARG and SLC30A8 loci were associated with the development of islet autoantibodies or diabetes. The type 2 diabetes susceptible genotype of TCF7L2 was associated with a lower risk of islet autoantibodies (7% vs. 12% by age of 10 years, P = 0.015, P(corrected) = 0.18). Overweight children at seroconversion did not progress to diabetes faster than non-overweight children (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.48-2.45, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support an association of type 2 diabetes risk factors with islet autoimmunity or acceleration of diabetes in children with a family history of type 1 diabetes.

22569928|t|Analysis of common type 2 diabetes mellitus genetic risk factors in new-onset diabetes after transplantation in kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus.
22569928|a|PURPOSE: New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a major complication after kidney transplantation. The risk factors for NODAT include the use of calcineurin inhibitors as part of the immunosuppressive regimen, among which tacrolimus has the most pronounced diabetogenic effect. Both NODAT and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) share several risk factors. Recent studies have identified a number of common genetic variants associated with increased risk of T2DM. Here we report the results of our study on the potential effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with T2DM on the risk of NODAT in kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus. METHODS: Seven SNPs in six genes known to increase the risk of T2DM in Caucasians were genotyped by means of TaqMan assays in 235 kidney transplant patients medicated with tacrolimus: rs4402960 and rs1470579 in IGF2BP2; rs1111875 in HHEX; rs10811661 upstream of CDKN2A/B; rs13266634 in SLC30A8; rs1801282 in PPARG; rs5215 in KCNJ11. The TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP was also included in the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: None of the analyzed SNPs was significantly associated with the risk of NODAT. However, the IGF2BP2 rs4402960 T allele was present significantly more frequently among patients diagnosed with NODAT more than 2  weeks after transplantation (p   =   0.048). Mean (   standard deviation) number of the analyzed alleles tended to be lower in patients without NODAT (6.19        1.71) than in NODAT patients (6.58        1.1.95; p   =   0.09) and significantly lower compared to late-onset NODAT patients (7.03        1.88; p   =   0.018). Multivariate analysis confirmed the significance of 'diabetogenic' allele number in late-onset NODAT development [odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95  % confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.78; p   =   0.017]. Additionally, individuals carrying >7 of the analyzed 'diabetogenic' alleles were at a significantly higher risk of NODAT (OR 2.17, 95 % CI 1.18-3.99; p   =   0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Complex analysis of genotypes increasing the risk of diabetes may lead to the identification of NODAT susceptibility predictors.

22583123|t|Association of TCF7L2 and ADIPOQ with body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and systolic blood pressure in an endogamous ethnic group of India.
22583123|a|Despite the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its established association with anthropometric and physiological traits as a risk factor, genetic studies focusing on the association of T2D-related genes with quantitative traits like body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) are only a few for western populations and rare for Indian populations. The present study tested the association of TCF7L2, HHEX, KCNJ11, and ADIPOQ with BMI, SBP, and WHR in men and women of the Aggarwal population of India and found a differential association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs4506565, and rs12256372) and ADIPOQ (rs2241766 and rs1501299) genes with increasing BMI, SBP, and WHR between the two sexes. We conclude that TCF7L2 and ADIPOQ together might play an important role in explaining these traits and to understand the biological and genetic mechanisms underlying T2D, and the role of other T2D genes must also be evaluated with these continuous traits.

22584884|t|The effect of type 2 diabetes risk loci on insulin requirements in type 1 diabetes.
22584884|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation between insulin requirements of type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients and genotype at type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci, obtained in our genome-wide association study. METHODS: From a database of detailed insulin dosing of 567 patients, we selected 177 for whom we also had genome-wide genotyping data. Using PLINK software, we examined the association between insulin requirement as a quantitative trait and nineteen T2D risk loci. RESULTS: Out of 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs13266634 on chromosome 8 and rs7901695 on chromosome 10 showed nominal significance of association (p < 0.05). The first SNP is nonsynonymous (325 Arg>Trp) and maps to the SLC30A8 gene encoding the b-cell-specific ZnT8 zinc transporter, while the second is an intronic SNP in TCF7L2, the strongest known T2D association. Both loci exert their effect on b-cells and, in both, the T2D risk allele is associated with lower insulin requirements. CONCLUSION: We identified two T2D susceptibility loci that modulate insulin requirements in T1D patients. Our results are consistent with the association of lower insulin secretion with higher insulin sensitivity. To explain the continuation of this correlation after b-cell destruction, we hypothesize an epigenetic mechanism that alters insulin responsiveness in T1D patients based on b-cell function in early life. Such knowledge may allow a more precise approach to treatment.

22590553|t|An in vivo cis-regulatory screen at the type 2 diabetes associated TCF7L2 locus identifies multiple tissue-specific enhancers.
22590553|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have repeatedly shown an association between non-coding variants in the TCF7L2 locus and risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D), implicating a role for cis-regulatory variation within this locus in disease etiology. Supporting this hypothesis, we previously localized complex regulatory activity to the TCF7L2 T2D-associated interval using an in vivo bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) enhancer-trapping reporter strategy. To follow-up on this broad initial survey of the TCF7L2 regulatory landscape, we performed a fine-mapping enhancer scan using in vivo mouse transgenic reporter assays. We functionally interrogated approximately 50% of the sequences within the T2D-associated interval, utilizing sequence conservation within this 92-kb interval to determine the regulatory potential of all evolutionary conserved sequences that exhibited conservation to the non-eutherian mammal opossum. Included in this study was a detailed functional interrogation of sequences spanning both protective and risk alleles of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146, which has exhibited allele-specific enhancer function in pancreatic beta cells. Using these assays, we identified nine segments regulating various aspects of the TCF7L2 expression profile and that constitute nearly 70% of the sequences tested. These results highlight the regulatory complexity of this interval and support the notion that a TCF7L2 cis-regulatory disruption leads to T2D predisposition.

22591707|t|Genetic prediction of postpartum diabetes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
22591707|a|AIMS: To examine whether genetic variants that predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes (T2D) could predict the development of diabetes after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: 13 SNPs (FTO rs8050136, CDKAL1 rs7754840 and rs7756992, CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, HHEX rs1111875, IGF2BP2 rs1470579 and rs4402960, SLC30A8 rs13266634, TCF7L2 rs7903146, PPARG rs1801282, GCK rs1799884, HNF1A rs1169288, and KCNJ11 rs5219) were genotyped in 793 women with GDM after a median follow-up of 57 months. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and ethnicity, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 and the FTO rs8050136 variants significantly predicted postpartum diabetes; hazard ratio (95% confidence interval 1.29 (1.01-1.66) and 1.36 (1.06-1.74), respectively (additive model) versus 1.45 (1.01-2.08) and 1.56 (1.06-2.29) (dominant model)). Adjusting for BMI attenuated the effect of the FTO variant, suggesting that the effect was mediated through its effect on BMI. Combining all risk alleles to a weighted risk score was significantly associated with the risk of postpartum diabetes (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.18, p=0.00016 after adjustment for age and ethnicity). CONCLUSIONS: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 and FTO rs8050136 polymorphisms, and particularly a weighted risk score of T2D risk alleles, predict diabetes after GDM. Further studies in other populations are needed to confirm our results.

22688542|t|Genetic risk score constructed using 14 susceptibility alleles for type 2 diabetes is associated with the early onset of diabetes and may predict the future requirement of insulin injections among Japanese individuals.
22688542|a|OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the clinical usefulness of a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 14 well-established variants for type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 14 SNPs at HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, SLC30A8, KCNJ11, IGF2BP2, PPARG, TCF7L2, FTO, KCNQ1, IRS-1, GCKR, UBE2E2, and C2CD4A/B in 1,487 Japanese individuals (724 patients with type 2 diabetes and 763 control subjects). A GRS was calculated according to the number of risk alleles by counting all 14 SNPs (T-GRS) as well as 11 SNPs related to b-cell function (b-GRS) and then assessing the association between each GRS and the clinical features. RESULTS: Among the 14 SNPs, 4 SNPs were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in the present Japanese sample (P < 0.0036). The T-GRS was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 5.9 * 10(-21)). Among the subjects with type 2 diabetes, the b-GRS was associated with individuals receiving insulin therapy (b = 0.0131, SE = 0.006, P = 0.0431), age at diagnosis (b = -0.608, SE = 0.204, P = 0.0029), fasting serum C-peptide level (b = -0.032, SE = 0.0140, P = 0.022), and C-peptide index (b = -0.031, SE = 0.012, P = 0.0125). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the b-GRS is associated with reduced b-cell functions and may be useful for selecting patients who should receive more aggressive b-cell-preserving therapy.

22712642|t|TCF7L2 polymorphism and cognitive test performance in cardiovascular disease.
22712642|a|AIMS: The present study examines cognitive function among transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) genotype groups in a sample of older adults with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We recruited 111 older adults with diagnosed cardiovascular disease from outpatient cardiology clinics. Neuropsychological tests assessed the following domains of cognitive functioning: global function, attention/executive/psychomotor speed, learning and memory, visuospatial/construction, motor, and language. Genotyping of TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 was conducted to determine membership in the TT, CT, or CC genotype groups. RESULTS: Controlling for diabetes status, participants with the TT genotype of TCF7L2 (n= 12) performed worse on tests of attention/executive function/processing speed than those with the CC (n= 46) and CT (n= 53) genotypes, despite no between-group differences in demographic or medical variables. CONCLUSIONS: Older cardiovascular disease patients with the TCF7L2 TT genotype performed worse on tests of attention/executive/ psychomotor speed than CC and CT genotype carriers. Further work using neuroimaging and glucose tolerance indices is needed to clarify underlying mechanisms.

22717537|t|Abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in pancreas-specific Tcf7l2-null mice.
22717537|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Individuals carrying type 2 diabetes risk alleles in TCF7L2 display decreased beta cell levels of T cell factor 7 like-2 (TCF7L2) immunoreactivity, and impaired insulin secretion and beta cell sensitivity to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Here, we sought to determine whether selective deletion of Tcf7l2 in mouse pancreas impairs insulin release and glucose homeostasis. METHODS: Pancreas-specific Tcf7l2-null (pTcf7l2) mice were generated by crossing mice carrying conditional knockout alleles of Tcf7l2 (Tcf7l2-flox) with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Pdx1 promoter (Pdx1.Cre). Gene expression was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and beta cell mass by optical projection tomography. Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion from isolated islets, and plasma insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 content were assessed by standard protocols. RESULTS: From 12 weeks of age, pTcf7l2 mice displayed decreased oral glucose tolerance vs control littermates; from 20 weeks they had glucose intolerance upon administration of glucose by the intraperitoneal route. pTcf7l2 islets displayed impaired insulin secretion in response to 17 (vs 3.0) mmol/l glucose (54.6    4.6%, p < 0.01) or to 17 mmol/l glucose plus 100 nmol/l GLP-1 (44.3    4.9%, p < 0.01) compared with control islets. Glp1r (42    0.08%, p < 0.01) and Ins2 (15.4    4.6%, p < 0.01) expression was significantly lower in pTcf7l2 islets than in controls. Maintained on a high-fat (but not on a normal) diet, pTcf7l2 mice displayed decreased expansion of pancreatic beta cell volume vs control littermates. No differences were observed in plasma insulin, proinsulin, glucagon or GLP-1 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Selective deletion of Tcf7l2 in the pancreas replicates key aspects of the altered glucose homeostasis in human carriers of TCF7L2 risk alleles, indicating the direct role of this factor in controlling beta cell function.

22719219|t|Reduction in Tcf7l2 expression decreases diabetic susceptibility in mice.
22719219|a|OBJECTIVE: The WNT signaling pathway effector gene TCF7L2 has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unclear how this gene affects diabetic pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of Tcf7l2 haploinsufficiency on metabolic phenotypes in mice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tcf7l2 knockout (Tcf7l   /   ) mice were generated. Because of the early mortality of Tcf7l2   /    mice, we characterized the metabolic phenotypes of heterozygous Tcf7l2   /    mice in comparison to the wild-type controls. The mice were fed a normal chow diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks. RESULTS: The Tcf7l2   /    mice showed significant differences from the wild-type mice with regards to body weight, fasting glucose and insulin levels. Tcf7l2   /    mice displayed improved glucose tolerance. In the liver of Tcf7l2   /    mice fed on the HFD, reduced lipogenesis and hepatic triglyceride levels were observed when compared with those of wild-type mice. Furthermore, the Tcf7l2   /    mice fed on the HFD exhibited decreased peripheral fat deposition. Immunohistochemistry in mouse pancreatic islets showed that endogenous expression of Tcf7l2 was upregulated in the wild-type mice, but not in the Tcf7l2   /    mice, after feeding with the HFD. However, the haploinsufficiency of Tcf7l2 in mouse pancreatic islets resulted in little changes in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased expression of Tcf7l2 confers reduction of diabetic susceptibility in mice via regulation on the metabolism of glucose and lipid.

22733757|t|Chemical and genetic evidence for the involvement of Wnt antagonist Dickkopf2 in regulation of glucose metabolism.
22733757|a|Mutations in Wnt receptor LRP5/6 and polymorphism in Wnt-regulated transcription factor TCF7L2 are associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism. However, it is not clear whether Wnt antagonist Dickkopf (Dkk) has a significant role in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Here, we identified small-molecule inhibitors of Wnt antagonist Dkk through molecular modeling, computation-based virtual screens, and biological assays. One of the Dkk inhibitors reduced basal blood-glucose concentrations and improved glucose tolerance in mice. This Dkk inhibitor appeared to act through DKK2 because the inhibitor exerted no additional effects on glucose metabolism in the Dkk2(-/-) mice. Our study of Dkk2(-/-) mice showed that DKK2 deficiency was associated with increased hepatic glycogen accumulation and decreased hepatic glucose output. DKK2 deficiency did not cause in increase in insulin production but resulted in increased Wnt activity and GLP1 production in the intestines. Given that the Dkk inhibitor improved glucose tolerance in a murine model of type 2 diabetes (db/db), we suggest that DKK2 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating type 2 diabetes.

22749234|t|Contribution of common variants of ENPP1, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, MLXIPL, PPARy, SLC30A8 and TCF7L2 to the risk of type 2 diabetes in Lebanese and Tunisian Arabs.
22749234|a|BACKGROUND: While several type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been replicated in many populations, their association in Arabs has not been reported. For this reason, the present study looked at the contribution of ENNP1 (rs1044498), IGF2BP2 (rs1470579), KCNJ11 (rs5219), MLXIPL (rs7800944), PPARy (rs1801282), SLC30A8 (rs13266634) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146) SNPs to the risk of T2DM in Lebanese and Tunisian Arabs. METHODS: Study subjects (case/controls) were Lebanese (751/918) and Tunisians (1470/838). Genotyping was carried out by the allelic discrimination method. RESULTS: In Lebanese and Tunisians, neither ENNP1 nor MLXIPL was associated with T2DM, whereas TCF7L2 was significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM in both the Lebanese [P < 0.001; OR (95% CI): 1.38 (1.20-1.59)] and Tunisians [P < 0.001; OR (95% CI): 1.36 (1.18-1.56)]. Differential associations of IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARy and SLC30A8 with T2DM were noted in the two populations. IGF2BP2 [P = 1.3   10(-5); OR (95% CI): 1.66 (1.42-1.94)] and PPARy [P = 0.005; OR (95% CI): 1.41 (1.10-1.80)] were associated with T2DM in the Lebanese, but not Tunisians, while KCNJ11 [P = 8.0   10(-4); OR (95% CI): 1.27 (1.09-1.47)] and SLC30A8 [P = 1.6   10(-5); OR (95% CI): 1.37 (1.15-1.62)] were associated with T2DM in the Tunisians, but not Lebanese, after adjusting for gender and body mass index. CONCLUSION: T2DM susceptibility loci SNPs identified through GWAS showed differential associations with T2DM in two Arab populations, thus further confirming the ethnic contributions of these variants to T2DM susceptibility.

22768041|t|Allele summation of diabetes risk genes predicts impaired glucose tolerance in female and obese individuals.
22768041|a|INTRODUCTION: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in approximately 40 genes have been associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in genome-wide association studies. It is not known whether a similar genetic impact on the risk of prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] or impaired fasting glycemia [IFG]) exists. METHODS: In our cohort of 1442 non-diabetic subjects of European origin (normal glucose tolerance [NGT] n=1046, isolated IFG n=142, isolated IGT n=140, IFG+IGT n=114), an impact on glucose homeostasis has been shown for 9 SNPs in previous studies in this specific cohort. We analyzed these SNPs (within or in the vicinity of the genes TCF7L2, KCNJ11, HHEX, SLC30A8, WFS1, KCNQ1, MTNR1B, FTO, PPARG) for association with prediabetes. RESULTS: The genetic risk load was significantly associated with the risk for IGT (p=0.0006) in a model including gender, age, BMI and insulin sensitivity. To further evaluate potential confounding effects, we stratified the population on gender, BMI and insulin sensitivity. The association of the risk score with IGT was present in female participants (p=0.008), but not in male participants. The risk score was significantly associated with IGT (p=0.008) in subjects with a body mass index higher than 30 kg/m(2) but not in non-obese individuals. Furthermore, only in insulin resistant subjects a significant association between the genetic load and the risk for IGT (p=0.01) was found. DISCUSSION: We found that T2D genetic risk alleles cause an increased risk for IGT. This effect was not present in male, lean and insulin sensitive subjects, suggesting a protective role of beneficial environmental factors on the genetic risk.

22782288|t|Role of TCF7L2 risk variant and dietary fibre intake on incident type 2 diabetes.
22782288|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The T allele of transcription factor 7-like 2 gene variant, TCF7L2 rs7903146, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 40-50%. As TCF7L2 rs7903146 has been associated with diminished incretin effect we investigated whether interaction between dietary intake of carbohydrate, fat, protein or fibre and this variant affects the risk of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A cohort of 24,799 non-diabetic individuals from the Malm   Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS), with dietary data obtained by a modified diet history method, were followed up for 12 years, with 1,649 recordings of incident type 2 diabetes made. Risk of type 2 diabetes in strata of diet quintiles was analysed prospectively adjusting for potential confounders. Cross-sectional analyses were performed on baseline fasting glucose and HbA(1c) levels in a subset of 5,216 randomly selected individuals from the MDCS. RESULTS: The elevated risk of type 2 diabetes with rs7903146 (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.33, 1.56, p = 4.6   10(-19)) increased with higher intake of dietary fibre (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04, 1.47 to OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.31, 1.86 from the lowest to highest quintile; p (interaction) = 0.049). High intake of dietary fibre was inversely associated with diabetes incidence only among CC genotype carriers (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58, 0.94 per quintile, p = 0.025). The T allele was associated with 0.027% elevated HbA(1c) (p = 0.02) and this effect increased with higher intake of fibre (from -0.021% to 0.079% for the lowest to the highest quintile, p (interaction) = 0.02). Each quintile of higher fibre intake was associated with lower HbA(1c) levels among CC and CT but not among TT genotype carriers (-0.036%, p = 6.5   10(-7); -0.023%, p = 0.009; and 0.012%, p = 0.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that dietary fibre intake may modify the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and incidence of type 2 diabetes, and that higher fibre intake may associate with protection from type 2 diabetes only among non-risk allele carriers.

22796301|t|Review of the neuroanatomic landscape implicated in glucose sensing and regulation of nutrient signaling: immunophenotypic localization of diabetes gene Tcf7l2 in the developing murine brain.
22796301|a|Genetic variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2(Tcf7l2) gene have been found to confer a significant risk of type 2 diabetes and attenuated insulin secretion. Based on its genomic wide association Tcf7l2 is considered the single most important predictor of diabetes to date. Previous studies of Tcf7l2 mRNA localization in the adult brain suggest a putative role of Tcf7l2 in the CNS regulation of energy homeostasis. The present study further characterizes the immunophenotypic distribution of peptide expression in the brains of Tcf7l2 progeny during developmental time periods between E12.5 and P1. Tcf7l2(-/-) is lethal beyond P1. Results show that while negligible TCF7L2 expression is found in the developing brains of Tcf7l2(-/-)mice, TCF7L2 protein is relatively widespread and robustly expressed in the brain by E18.5 and exhibits specific expression within neuronal populations and regions of the brain in Tcf7l2(+/-) and Tcf7l2(+/+) progeny. Strong immunophenotypic labeling was found in the diencephalic structure of the thalamus that suggests a role of Tcf7l2 in the development and maintenance of thalamic activity. Strongly expressed TCF7L2 was localized in select hypothalamic and preoptic nuclei indicative of Tcf7l2 function within neurons controlling energy balance. Definitive neuronal staining for TCF7L2 within nuclei of the brain stem and circumventricular organs extends TCF7L2 localization within autonomic neurons and its potential integration with autonomic function. In addition robust TCF7L2 expression was found in the tectal and tegmental structures of the superior and inferior colliculi as well as transient expression in neuroepithelium of the cerebral and hippocampal cortices of E16 and E18.5. Patterns of TCF7L2 peptide localization when compared to the adult protein synthetic chemical/anatomical landscape of glucose sensing exhibit a good correlational fit between its expression and regions, nuclei, and pathways regulating energy homeostasis via integration and response to peripheral endocrine, metabolic and neuronal signaling. TCF was also found co-localized with peptides that regulate energy homeostasis including AgRP, POMC and NPY. TCF7l2, some variants of which have been shown to impair GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, was also found co-localize with GLP-1 in adult TCF wild type progeny. Impaired Tcf7l2-mediated neural regulation may contribute to the risk and/or underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes that has found high expression in genomic studies of Tcf7l2 variants.

22843023|t|TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes: association with diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.
22843023|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a complex disease resulting from the contribution of both environmental and genetic factors. Recently, the list of genes implicated in the susceptibility to T2DM has substantially grown, also as a consequence of the great development of the genome-wide association studies in the last decade. Common polymorphisms in TCF7L2 gene have shown to have a strong effect with respect to many other involved genes. The aims of our study were to confirm the role of TCF7L2 in the susceptibility to T2DM in the Italian population and to investigate whether TCF7L2 genotypes also contribute to the clinical phenotypes variability and to diabetic complications development. Three TCF7L2 polymorphisms (rs7903146, rs7901695 and rs12255372) have been analyzed by allelic discrimination assays in a cohort of 154 Italian patients with T2DM and 171 healthy controls. A case-control association study and a genotype-phenotype correlation study have been carried out. Consistent with previous studies, all three SNPs showed a strong association with susceptibility to T2DM, both at genotypic (P  =  0.003, P  =  0.004 and P  =  0.012) and at allelic level (P  =  0.0004, P  =  0.0004 and P  =  0.003). Moreover, we observed associations between TCF7L2 variants and the following diabetic complications: diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease. We also found a strong correlation between the rs7903146 and the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (P  =  0.02 with a high OR  =  8.28). In conclusion, our study, in addition to confirming the involvement of TCF7L2 gene in the T2DM susceptibility, has shown that TCF7L2 genetic variability also contributes to the development of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.

22862926|t|Incretin and pancreatic hormone secretion in Caucasian non-diabetic carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk T allele.
22862926|a|We characterised 62 non-diabetic, middle-aged, Caucasians with and without the T risk allele of rs7903146 in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) with regard to secretion of insulin, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) as well as insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production. All participants had a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), an intravenous glucose tolerance test and a euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp. After adjustment for age and sex, risk T allele carriers had higher haemoglobin A1c levels (p = 0.030), reduced first-phase insulin response (p = 0.048), higher peripheral insulin sensitivity (p = 0.050) and lower fasting GIP concentrations (p = 0.003) than CC allele carriers. The latter was also reflected by lower total GIP secretion during the OGTT (p = 0.018). We found no significant differences in endogenous glucose production, hepatic insulin sensitivity or fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 between the groups. The findings suggest that the effect of TCF7L2 on diabetes risk may include reduced secretion of GIP.

22865700|t|Integrating genetic association, genetics of gene expression, and single nucleotide polymorphism set analysis to identify susceptibility Loci for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
22865700|a|Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 genomic regions significantly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, GWAS results are not always straightforward to interpret, and linking these loci to meaningful disease etiology is often difficult without extensive follow-up studies. The authors expanded on previously reported type 2 diabetes mellitus GWAS from the nested case-control studies of 2 prospective US cohorts by incorporating expression single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information and applying SNP set enrichment analysis to identify sets of SNPs associated with genes that could provide further biologic insight to traditional genome-wide analysis. Using data collected between 1989 and 1994 in these previous studies to form a nested case-control study, the authors found that 3 of the most significantly associated SNPs to type 2 diabetes mellitus in their study are expression SNPs to the lymphocyte antigen 75 gene (LY75), the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 36 gene (USP36), and the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, cytoplasmic 1 gene (PITPNC1). SNP set enrichment analysis of the GWAS results identified enrichment for expression SNPs to the macrophage-enriched module and the Gene Ontology (GO) biologic process fat cell differentiation human, which includes the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), as well as other type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated genes. Integrating genome-wide association, gene expression, and gene set analysis may provide valuable biologic support for potential type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility loci and may be useful in identifying new targets or pathways of interest for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

22872755|t|Using gene-network landscape to dissect genotype effects of TCF7L2 genetic variant on diabetes and cardiovascular risk.
22872755|a|The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the TCF7L2 gene, rs7903146, is, to date, the most significant genetic marker associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk. Nonetheless, its functional role in disease pathology is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in vascular smooth muscle cells from 92 patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery, the contribution of this SNP in T2DM using expression levels and expression correlation comparison approaches, which were visually represented as gene interaction networks. Initially, the expression levels of 41 genes (seven TCF7L2 splice forms and 40 other T2DM relevant genes) were compared between rs7903146 wild-type (CC) and T2DM-risk (CT + TT) genotype groups. Next, we compared the expression correlation patterns of these 41 genes between groups to observe if the relationships between genes were different. Five TCF7L2 splice forms and nine genes showed significant expression differences between groups. RXRa gene was pinpointed as showing the most different expression correlation pattern with other genes. Therefore, T2DM risk alleles appear to be influencing TCF7L2 splice form's expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, and RXRa gene is pointed out as a treatment target candidate for risk reduction in individuals with high risk of developing T2DM, especially individuals harboring TCF7L2 risk genotypes.

22885420|t|Lack of association between the CC genotype of the rs7903146 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene and rheumatoid arthritis.
22885420|a|INTRODUCTION: TCF7L2 is a transcription factor involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and which has a variant known to be consistently associated with type 2 diabetes risk and some studies have also indicated its association with risk of certain types of cancer. OBJECTIVE: Since this pathway may be involved in the pathophysiology of other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, we aimed to investigate the effect of TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 on rheumatoid arthritis severity in a Brazilian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This polymorphism was genotyped in 208 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in 104 healthy controls. We also analyzed the association of this polymorphism to smoking history, functional status classification and radiological indicators of disease severity. RESULTS: The distribution of CC, CT and TT genotypes of SNP rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene was not different between patients and controls, and no association between the genotype and indicators of disease severity or smoking history was found. When data were evaluated using the dominant model, in which carriers of the CT and TT genotypes were grouped, an increase in the T allele was observed in patients positive for rheumatoid factor and erosions, although this was not significant. The frequency of T allele was also increased in patients with functional class II compared to class I (P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: It is possible that the small number of patients included in this study may have restrained additional findings. Further studies are therefore needed to investigate the role of TCF7L2 gene variants in the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and its severity.

22888288|t|Association of the TCF7L2 rs12255372 (G/T) variant with type 2 diabetes mellitus in an Iranian population.
22888288|a|In various populations worldwide, common variants of the TCF7L2 (Transcription factor 7-like 2) gene are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim was to investigate the association between rs12255372 (G/T) polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene and T2DM in an Iranian population. 236 unrelated patients with T2DM, and 255 normoglycemic controls without diabetes were studied. The PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping rs12255372 (G/T) polymorphism, and the SPSS version 18.0 for Windows for statistical analysis. The minor T allele of TCF7L2 rs12255372 was found to significantly increase the risk of T2DM, with an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.458 (95% CI 1.108-1.918, p = 0.007). A significant difference in TT genotype was observed between T2DM patients and normoglycemic controls (OR 2.038, 95% CI 1.147-3.623; p = 0.014). On assuming dominant and recessive models, ORs of 1.52 [95% CI (1.05-2.21) p = 0.026)] and 1.74 [95% CI (1.01-3.00) p = 0.043] were obtained, respectively, thereby implying that the co-dominant model would best fit the susceptible gene effect. This study further confirms the TCF7L2 gene as enhancing susceptibility to the development of T2DM.

22892353|t|The involvement of the wnt signaling pathway and TCF7L2 in diabetes mellitus: The current understanding, dispute, and perspective.
22892353|a|The Wnt signaling pathway was initially discovered for its role in tumorigenesis and the development of Drosophila and other eukaryotic organisms. The key effector of this pathway, the bipartite transcription factor b-cat/TCF, is formed by free b-catenin (b-cat) and a TCF protein, including TCF7L2. Extensive recent investigations have highlighted the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in metabolic homeostasis and its implication in diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Genome-wide association studies have shown that several key components of the Wnt signaling pathway are implicated in metabolic homeostasis and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite controversial observations regarding the role of Wnt signaling in the development and function of pancreatic islets, the discovery of the association between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms of TCF7L2 and T2D susceptibility has fueled great efforts to explore the role of Wnt signaling in the function of pancreatic b-cells and glucose homeostasis. Here we have introduced our basic understanding of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, summarized our current knowledge on its implication in metabolic homeostasis and T2D, discussed the work on TCF7L2 as a T2D susceptibility gene, and presented the controversial role of Wnt signaling and TCF7L2 in pancreatic islets as well as their potential metabolic function in other organs. We then expanded our view into the crosstalk among Wnt, insulin and FOXO signaling cascades, which further illustrates the complexity of the Wnt signaling pathway in metabolic homeostasis. Finally, we have presented our perspectives.

22904171|t|Differential gene expression in granulosa cells from polycystic ovary syndrome patients with and without insulin resistance: identification of susceptibility gene sets through network analysis.
22904171|a|CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous, genetically complex, endocrine disorder of uncertain etiology in women. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the gene expression profiles in stimulated granulosa cells of PCOS women with and without insulin resistance vs. matched controls. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study included 12 normal ovulatory women (controls), 12 women with PCOS without evidence for insulin resistance (PCOS non-IR), and 16 women with insulin resistance (PCOS-IR) undergoing in vitro fertilization. Granulosa cell gene expression profiling was accomplished using Affymetrix Human Genome-U133 arrays. Differentially expressed genes were classified according to gene ontology using ingenuity pathway analysis tools. Microarray results for selected genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A total of 211 genes were differentially expressed in PCOS non-IR and PCOS-IR granulosa cells (fold change>= 1.5; P <=0.001) vs. matched controls. Diabetes mellitus and inflammation genes were significantly increased in PCOS-IR patients. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed higher expression of NCF2 (2.13-fold), TCF7L2 (1.92-fold), and SERPINA1 (5.35-fold). Increased expression of inflammation genes ITGAX (3.68-fold) and TAB2 (1.86-fold) was confirmed in PCOS non-IR. Different cardiometabolic disease genes were differentially expressed in the two groups. Decreased expression of CAV1 (-3.58-fold) in PCOS non-IR and SPARC (-1.88-fold) in PCOS-IR was confirmed. Differential expression of genes involved in TGF-b signaling (IGF2R, increased; and HAS2, decreased), and oxidative stress (TXNIP, increased) was confirmed in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis demonstrated differential expression of genes linked to diabetes mellitus, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and infertility in the granulosa cells of PCOS women with and without insulin resistance. Because these dysregulated genes are also involved in oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling, we hypothesize that these genes may be involved in follicular growth arrest and metabolic disorders associated with the different phenotypes of PCOS.

22911383|t|TCF7L2 rs7903146 impairs islet function and morphology in non-diabetic individuals.
22911383|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a Wnt-signalling-associated transcription factor. Genetic studies have clearly demonstrated that DNA polymorphisms within TCF7L2 confer the strongest known association with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of the TCF7L2 type-2-diabetes-associated rs7903146 T allele on biological function and morphology of human pancreatic islets is unknown. METHODS: Paraffin sections of pancreases from 187 brain-deceased donors (HbA(1c) <6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) were used to genotype the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 and evaluate its impact on islet morphology and alpha and beta cell subpopulations following immunostaining for glucagon and C-peptide. Following islet isolation, we investigated the correlation between TCF7L2 genotype and in vitro islet functional variables from our in-house pancreatic database. RESULTS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T/T) was associated with reduced basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated human islets, and reduced islet density in whole pancreas. Morphological analysis demonstrated islet size was increased in T/T carriers. Furthermore, rs7903146 was associated with an increased glucagon/C-peptide ratio, especially in bigger islets. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 risk allele is associated with impaired insulin secretion, reduction of total islet number and quantitative as well as qualitative morphological changes in human islets. Understanding how the TCF7L2 genotype modulates its activity and how TCF7L2 impacts the islet morphology may aid the design of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

22916254|t|Effects of rs7903146 variation in the Tcf7l2 gene in the lipid metabolism of three different populations.
22916254|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 rs7903146 is an important genetic factor predicting type 2 diabetes (T2DM) which has also been linked to higher cardiovascular risk. To date, there is little information about the additional impact of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) beyond glucose metabolism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied whether rs7903146 influenced postprandial lipid metabolism in three different populations (healthy young men, metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients and elderly persons). Eighty-eight healthy males were submitted to a single saturated fatty acid-rich test meal. Additionally, 110 middle-aged MetS patients and 20 healthy elderly persons (>=  65 years) were submitted to three different dietary models followed by test meals. Minor allele homozygotes for rs7903146 showed a worse postprandial lipemia profile in young males, as seen by a lower HDL-cholesterol and Apo A1 concentration during the postprandial lipemia and a trend towards higher triglycerides (TG), than the other genotypes. In healthy elderly persons, carriers of the minor allele showed higher total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Apo B and TG in the fasting state, and a higher postprandial area under the curve for total cholesterol, Apo B, small-triglyceride rich lipoprotein (TRL) cholesterol and small-(TRL) triglycerides. These results were accompanied by differential changes in adipokines. We did not observe any influence of rs7903146 on the postprandium of MetS patients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Healthy young males and elderly persons who are carriers of the mutant allele for rs7903146 have an impaired postprandial lipid metabolism that may be mediated by an alteration in adipokine regulation, and may be related to the higher cardiovascular risk observed in these persons.

22923468|t|Contribution of common genetic variation to the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Mexican Mestizo population.
22923468|a|Several studies have identified nearly 40 different type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci, mainly in European populations, but few of them have been evaluated in the Mexican population. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which 24 common genetic variants previously associated with type 2 diabetes are associated in Mexican Mestizos. Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near genes (KCNJ11, PPARG, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, ARHGEF11, JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, FTO, TSPAN8/LGR5, KCNQ1, THADA, ADAMTS9, NOTCH2, NXPH1, RORA, UBQLNL, and RALGPS2) were genotyped in Mexican Mestizos. A case-control association study comprising 1,027 type 2 diabetic individuals and 990 control individuals was conducted. To account for population stratification, a panel of 104 ancestry-informative markers was analyzed. Association to type 2 diabetes was found for rs13266634 (SLC30A8), rs7923837 (HHEX), rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs12779790 (CDC123/CAMK1D), and rs2237892 (KCNQ1). In addition, rs7754840 (CDKAL1) was associated in the nonobese type 2 diabetic subgroup, and for rs7903146 (TCF7L2), association was observed for early-onset type 2 diabetes. Lack of association for the rest of the variants may have resulted from insufficient power to detect smaller allele effects.

22934027|t|The role of the Wnt signaling pathway in incretin hormone production and function.
22934027|a|Glucose metabolism is tightly controlled by multiple hormones and neurotransmitters in response to nutritional, environmental, and emotional changes. In addition to insulin and glucagon produced by pancreatic islets, two incretin hormones, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP, also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), also play important roles in blood glucose homeostasis. The incretin hormones mainly exert their regulatory effects via their corresponding receptors, which are expressed in pancreatic islets as well as many other extra-pancreatic organs. Recent studies have shown that the genes which encode these two incretin hormones can be regulated by the effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway, including TCF7L2, a transcription factor identified recently by extensive genome wide association studies as an important type 2 diabetes risk gene. Interestingly, TCF7L2 and b-catenin (b-cat), another effector of Wnt signaling pathway, may also mediate the function of the incretin hormones as well as the expression of their receptors in pancreatic b-cells. In this review, we have introduced the incretin hormones and the Wnt signaling pathway, summarized recent findings in the field, and provided our perspectives.

22936689|t|Pancreatic beta-cell function and type 2 diabetes risk: quantify the causal effect using a Mendelian randomization approach based on meta-analyses.
22936689|a|The objective of the study is to quantify the causal effect of b-cell function on type 2 diabetes by minimizing residual confounding and reverse causation. We employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach using TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 as an instrument for lifelong levels of b-cell function. We first conducted two sets of meta-analyses to quantify the association of the TCF7L2 variant with the risk of type 2 diabetes among 55 436 cases and 106 020 controls from 66 studies by calculating pooled odds ratio (OR) and to quantify the associations with multiple direct or indirect measures of b-cell function among 35 052 non-diabetic individuals from 31 studies by calculating pooled mean difference. We further applied the method of MR to obtain the causal estimates for the effect of b-cell function on type 2 diabetes risk based on findings from the meta-analyses. The OR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.87 (0.81-0.93) for each five unit increment in homeostasis model assessment of insulin secretion (HOMA-%B) (P = 3.0 * 10(-5)). In addition, for measures based on intravenous glucose tolerance test, ORs (95% CI) associated with type 2 diabetes risk were 0.24 (0.08-0.74) (P = 0.01) and 0.14 (0.04-0.48) (P = 0.002) for per 1 standard deviation increment in insulin sensitivity index and disposition index, respectively. Findings from the present study lend support to a causal role of pancreatic b-cell function itself in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.

22945304|t|TCF7L2 promotes beta cell regeneration in human and mouse pancreas.
22945304|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes is characterised by loss and dysfunction of the beta cell. A major goal of diabetes therapy is to promote the formation of new beta cells. Polymorphisms of T cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are associated with type 2 diabetes, negatively regulating beta cell survival and function. Here, we provide evidence for a role of TCF7L2 in beta cell proliferation and regeneration. METHODS: Pancreatic sections from three mouse models (high-fat diet, exendin-4 and streptozotocin-treated mice) and from healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes were used to investigate the association of beta cell regeneration and TCF7L2 levels. To analyse a direct effect of TCF7L2 on duct cell to beta cell conversion, TCF7L2 was overexpressed in isolated exocrine cells. RESULTS: TCF7L2 levels correlated with beta cell compensation during high-fat diet feeding. TCF7L2 was increased together with pancreatic duct cell proliferation and differentiation. Small islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) that contained TCF7L2 originated in the vicinity of the ductal epithelium. In human isolated exocrine tissue, TCF7L2 overexpression induced proliferation of pancreatic duct cells and ICC formation next to duct cells, an effect dependent on the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study demonstrates that TCF7L2 overexpression fosters beta cell regeneration. Our findings imply correlation of TCF7L2 levels and new beta cell formation.

22951069|t|Cell type-specific binding patterns reveal that TCF7L2 can be tethered to the genome by association with GATA3.
22951069|a|BACKGROUND: The TCF7L2 transcription factor is linked to a variety of human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in six human cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 116,000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites, with only 1,864 sites common to the six cell lines. Using ChIP-seq, we showed that many genomic regions that are marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac are also bound by TCF7L2, suggesting that TCF7L2 plays a critical role in enhancer activity. Bioinformatic analysis of the cell type-specific TCF7L2 binding sites revealed enrichment for multiple transcription factors, including HNF4alpha and FOXA2 motifs in HepG2 cells and the GATA3 motif in MCF7 cells. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that TCF7L2 co-localizes with HNF4alpha and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells and with GATA3 in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, in MCF7 cells the TCF7L2 motif is enriched in most TCF7L2 sites but is not enriched in the sites bound by both GATA3 and TCF7L2. This analysis suggested that GATA3 might tether TCF7L2 to the genome at these sites. To test this hypothesis, we depleted GATA3 in MCF7 cells and showed that TCF7L2 binding was lost at a subset of sites. RNA-seq analysis suggested that TCF7L2 represses transcription when tethered to the genome via GATA3. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate a novel relationship between GATA3 and TCF7L2, and reveal important insights into TCF7L2-mediated gene regulation.

22966074|t|The Wnt signaling pathway effector TCF7L2 controls gut and brain proglucagon gene expression and glucose homeostasis.
22966074|a|The type 2 diabetes risk gene TCF7L2 is the effector of the Wnt signaling pathway. We found previously that in gut endocrine L-cell lines, TCF7L2 controls transcription of the proglucagon gene (gcg), which encodes the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Whereas peripheral GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion, brain GLP-1 controls energy homeostasis through yet-to-be defined mechanisms. We aim to determine the metabolic effect of a functional knockdown of TCF7L2 by generating transgenic mice that express dominant-negative TCF7L2 (TCF7L2DN) specifically in gcg-expressing cells. The gcg-TCF7L2DN transgenic mice showed reduced gcg expression in their gut and brain, but not in pancreas. Defects in glucose homeostasis were observed in these mice, associated with attenuated plasma insulin levels in response to glucose challenge. The defect in glucose disposal was exacerbated with high-fat diet. Brain Wnt activity and feeding-mediated hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) repression in these mice were impaired. Peripheral injection of the cAMP-promoting agent forskolin increased brain b-cat Ser675 phosphorylation and brain gcg expression and restored feeding-mediated hypothalamic AMPK repression. We conclude that TCF7L2 and Wnt signaling control gut and brain gcg expression and glucose homeostasis and speculate that positive cross-talk between Wnt and GLP-1/cAMP signaling is an underlying mechanism for brain GLP-1 in exerting its metabolic functions.

22967502|t|The Wnt signaling pathway effector TCF7L2 is upregulated by insulin and represses hepatic gluconeogenesis.
22967502|a|Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) are strongly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 and b-catenin (b-cat) form the bipartite transcription factor cat/TCF in stimulating Wnt target gene expression. cat/TCF may also mediate the effect of other signaling cascades, including that of cAMP and insulin in cell-type specific manners. As carriers of TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes risk SNPs demonstrated increased hepatic glucose production, we aimed to determine whether TCF7L2 expression is regulated by nutrient availability and whether TCF7L2 and Wnt regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. We examined hepatic Wnt activity in the TOPGAL transgenic mouse, assessed hepatic TCF7L2 expression in mice upon feeding, determined the effect of insulin on TCF7L2 expression and b-cat Ser          phosphorylation, and investigated the effect of Wnt activation and TCF7L2 knockdown on gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in hepatocytes. Wnt activity was observed in pericentral hepatocytes in the TOPGAL mouse, whereas TCF7L2 expression was detected in human and mouse hepatocytes. Insulin and feeding stimulated hepatic TCF7L2 expression in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, insulin activated b-cat Ser          phosphorylation. Wnt activation by intraperitoneal lithium injection repressed hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in vivo, whereas lithium or Wnt-3a reduced gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production in hepatic cells in vitro. Small interfering RNA-mediated TCF7L2 knockdown increased glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression in cultured hepatocytes. These observations suggest that Wnt signaling and TCF7L2 are negative regulators of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and TCF7L2 is among the downstream effectors of insulin in hepatocytes.

22993124|t|Genetics of type 2 diabetes in East Asian populations.
22993124|a|Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) is highly familial, there has been a concentrated effort to uncover the genetic basis of T2D worldwide over the last decade. In East Asians, T2D is experiencing a rapidly rising prevalence that is characterized by a relatively lower body mass index, as compared with that in Europeans. To date, at least 15 convincing T2D loci have been identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses in East Asians. Many of these are likely responsible for pancreatic b cell function, as indicated in studies from Europeans. Many T2D loci have been replicated across the ethnic groups. There are, however, substantial interethnic differences in frequency and effect size of these risk alleles. Despite accumulating genetic information on T2D, there are still limitations in our ability to explain the rapidly rising prevalence and lean phenotype of disease observed in East Asians, suggesting that more extensive work using diverse research strategies is needed in the future.

22996130|t|From mice to humans.
22996130|a|The genomes of many species have now been completely sequenced including human and mouse. Great progress has been made in understanding the complex genetics that underlie diabetes and obesity in human populations. One of the current challenges is the functional identification and characterization of the genes within loci that are being mapped. There are many approaches to this problem and this review outlines the valuable role that the mouse can play. We outline the mouse resources that are available to the research community, including knockouts with conditional potential for every gene, and the efforts of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium to attach phenotype information to these genes. We also briefly consider the potential of TALEN technology to tailor-make new mouse models of specific mutations discovered in humans. Finally, we consider the recent progress in characterizing the GWAS genes FTO, TCF7L2, CDKAL1, and SLC30A8 in engineered mouse models.

23010200|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese population: a meta-analysis.
23010200|a|Variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the available data on this relationship are inconsistent in Han Chinese populations. A meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively analyze the association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with T2DM using previous case-control studies in Chinese Han populations. Several electronic databases were searched for relevant articles up to May 2012. After data collection and gene loci selection, a meta-analysis was performed to assess heterogeneity, combine results and evaluate variations. Publication bias was examined by the Egger's linear regression test. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test and by omitting one study at a time were employed for the sensitivity analysis. Eighteen studies from sixteen eligible papers were included in the meta-analysis. Ten eligible studies were analyzed for rs7903146, and eight were analyzed for rs290487. We found that the rs7903146 T allele was associated with an increased risk for T2DM under a dominant model, a co-dominant model and an allele contrast model, with an OR of 1.54 (1.32, 1.79), an OR of 1.53 (1.31, 1.79) and an OR of 1.52 (1.31, 1.76), respectively. The rs290487 C allele showed no significant overall association with T2DM, yielding ORs of 1.08 (0.88, 1.32) under a dominant model, with strong evidence of heterogeneity. Similar results were also obtained in other genetic models. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability and stability of this meta-analysis. The accumulated evidence suggested that the rs7903146 T allele was associated with an increased risk for T2DM, but the rs290487 C allele is not associated with T2DM in the Chinese Han population. More well-designed large studies are required for the validation of this association.

23011354|t|In vitro scan for enhancers at the TCF7L2 locus.
23011354|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recent functional characterisations of genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci suggest that cis-regulatory variation may be a common paradigm for complex disease susceptibility. Several studies point to a similar mechanism at the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) GWAS locus for type 2 diabetes. To address this possibility, we carried out an in vitro scan of this diabetes-associated locus to fine-map cis-regulatory sequences within this genomic interval. METHODS: A systematic cell-based enhancer strategy was employed to interrogate all sequences within the 92 kb type-2-diabetes-association interval for cis-regulatory activity in a panel of cell lines (HCT-116, Neuro-2a, C2C12, U2OS, MIN6 and HepG2). We further evaluated chromatin state at a subset of these regions in HCT-116 and U2OS cells and examined allelic-specific enhancer properties at the type-2-diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146. RESULTS: In total, we assigned cis-regulatory activity to approximately 30% (9/28) of constructs tested. Notably, a subset of enhancers was active across multiple cell lines and overlapped with key epigenetic markers suggestive of cis-regulatory sequences. We further replicated the allelic-specific properties for SNP rs7903146 in pancreatic beta cells and additionally demonstrate identical allelic-specific enhancer effects in other cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a detailed map of cis-regulatory elements within the TCF7L2 GWAS locus and support the hypothesis of cis-regulatory variation leading to type 2 diabetes predisposition. The detection of allelic-specific effects for SNP rs7903146 in multiple cell lines further alludes to the likelihood of a peripheral defect in disease aetiology.

23014255|t|Relationship of transcription factor 7 like 2 gene rs7903146 variation with type 2 diabetes and obesity related parameters.
23014255|a|AIMS: The allele frequencies of transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) gene rs7903146 polymorphism in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-T2DM controls were determined. METHODS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes were determined with qPCR. RESULTS: The TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 genotype frequencies for homozygous wild type (C/C), heterozygous (C/T) and homozygous polymorphic (T/T) for T2DM patients were determined, respectively, as 71.4%, 14.3%, 14.3% and 72.5%, 11.8%, 15.7% for controls. The weight, length and lean body mass were higher in C/T+T/T compared to C/C carriers. Glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) were nonsignificantly higher in rs7903146C/T+T/T in comparison to C/C. TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 genotypes were not found to interact with drugs. The absence of any difference between genotype frequencies among study groups indicates that no association persists with TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 polymorphism and T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of rs7903146 variation over some obesity variables suggest that this variation may effect T2DM development via obesity.

23014256|t|Genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other specific types of diabetes; its role in treatment modalities.
23014256|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is among the most challenging health issues of the 21st century and is associated with an alarming rise in the incidence. The pathophysiological processes that lead to development of T2DM are still unclear, however impairment in insulin secretion and/or action is clearly indicated. Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder with multiple genes located on different chromosomes contributing to its susceptibility. Analysis of the genetic factors is further complicated by the fact that numerous environmental factors interact with genes to produce the disorder. Only a minority of cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by single gene defects and one example is maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Previous studies indicated that variants in genes encoding the pancreatic b-cell K+ATP channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) are associated with neonatal diabetes. Six different types of maturity onset diabetes of young (MODY) have been identified based on characteristic gene defect. The common Pro12Ala polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPAR-y) gene was confirmed in several studies to be associated with type 2 diabetes as well. More recently, studies reported variants within a novel gene, TCF7L2, as a putative susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes across many ethnic backgrounds around the world. MODY patients respond better to sulphonylureas and metformin, while neonatal diabetes patients with genetic mutations can be changed from insulin to oral drugs. We hereby provide a comprehensive review on the role of genetics in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

23018631|t|Individualized therapy for type 2 diabetes: clinical implications of pharmacogenetic data.
23018631|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance, abnormally elevated hepatic glucose production, and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Treatment with antihyperglycemic agents is initially successful in type 2 diabetes, but it is often associated with a high secondary failure rate, and the addition of insulin is eventually necessary for many patients, in order to restore acceptable glycemic control and to reduce the risk of development and progression of disease complications. Notably, even patients who appear to have similar requirements of antidiabetic regimens show great variability in drug disposition, glycemic response, tolerability, and incidence of adverse effects during treatment. Pharmacogenomics is a promising area of investigation and involves the search for genetic polymorphisms that may explain the interindividual variability in antidiabetic therapy response. The initial positive results portend that genomic efforts will be able to shed important light on variability in pharmacologic traits. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of genetic polymorphisms that may affect the responses of subjects with T2DM to antidiabetic treatment. These genes belong to three major classes: genes involved in drug metabolism and transporters that influence pharmacokinetics (including the cytochrome P450 [CYP] superfamily, the organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP] family, and the polyspecific organic cation transporter [OCT] family); genes encoding drug targets and receptors (including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARG], the adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-sensitive potassium channel [K(ATP)], and incretin receptors); and genes involved in the causal pathway of T2DM that are able to modify the effects of drugs (including adipokines, transcription factor 7-like 2 (T cell specific, HMG-box) [TCF7L2], insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS1], nitric oxide synthase 1 (neuronal) adaptor protein [NOS1AP], and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 [SLC30A8]). In addition to these three major classes, we also review the available evidence on novel genes (CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 [CDKAL1], insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 [IGF2BP2], potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 [KCNQ1], paired box 4 [PAX4] and neuronal differentiation 1 [NEUROD1] transcription factors, ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM], and serine racemase [SRR]) that have recently been proposed as possible modulators of therapeutic response in subjects with T2DM.

23028378|t|TCF7L2 modulates glucose homeostasis by regulating CREB- and FoxO1-dependent transcriptional pathway in the liver.
23028378|a|Peripheral insulin resistance contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 has been tightly associated with this disease, although the exact mechanism was largely elusive. Here we propose a novel role of TCF7L2 in hepatic glucose metabolism in mammals. Expression of medium and short isoforms of TCF7L2 was greatly diminished in livers of diet-induced and genetic mouse models of insulin resistance, prompting us to delineate the functional role of these isoforms in hepatic glucose metabolism. Knockdown of hepatic TCF7L2 promoted increased blood glucose levels and glucose intolerance with increased gluconeogenic gene expression in wild-type mice, in accordance with the PCR array data showing that only the gluconeogenic pathway is specifically up-regulated upon depletion of hepatic TCF7L2. Conversely, overexpression of a nuclear isoform of TCF7L2 in high-fat diet-fed mice ameliorated hyperglycemia with improved glucose tolerance, suggesting a role of this factor in hepatic glucose metabolism. Indeed, we observed a binding of TCF7L2 to promoters of gluconeogenic genes; and expression of TCF7L2 inhibited adjacent promoter occupancies of CREB, CRTC2, and FoxO1, critical transcriptional modules in hepatic gluconeogenesis, to disrupt target gene transcription. Finally, haploinsufficiency of TCF7L2 in mice displayed higher glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance, which were rescued by hepatic expression of a nuclear isoform of TCF7L2 at the physiological level. Collectively, these data suggest a crucial role of TCF7L2 in hepatic glucose metabolism; reduced hepatic expression of nuclear isoforms of this factor might be a critical instigator of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

23029294|t|Meta-analysis of the relationship between common type 2 diabetes risk gene variants with gestational diabetes mellitus.
23029294|a|BACKGROUND: A number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association of common type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk gene polymorphisms with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, these studies have yielded contradictory results. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the association between these polymorphisms and GDM, hence achieve a better understanding to the relationship between T2D and GDM. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. A meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between 9 polymorphisms from 8 genes and susceptibility to GDM. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity among articles and their publication bias were also tested. RESULTS: We identified 22 eligible studies including a total of 10,336 GDM cases and 17,445 controls. We found 8 genetic polymorphisms were significantly associated with GDM in a random-effects meta-analysis. These polymorphisms were in or near the following genes: TCF7L2 (rs7903146), MTNR1B (rs10830963), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), KCNJ11 (rs5219), CDKAL1 (rs7754840), KCNQ1 (rs2237892 and rs2237895) and GCK (rs4607517); while no association was found for PPARG with GDM risk. Similar results were also observed under dominant genetic model for these polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found 8 genetic variants associated with GDM. The relative contribution and relevance of the identified genes in the pathogenesis of GDM should be the focus of future studies.

23034957|t|TCF7L2 genetic variants modulate the effect of dietary fat intake on changes in body composition during a weight-loss intervention.
23034957|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 gene variants have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and higher adiposity. Observational studies and short-term trials have suggested that macronutrients may modify these effects. However, to our knowledge, this has yet to be verified in long-term interventions. OBJECTIVE: In a long-term intervention setting, we investigated the effects of TCF7L2 polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 and dietary total fat on changes in body composition and subsequent glycemic control. DESIGN: Data were analyzed for 591 participants in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (Pounds Lost) trial, which is a 2-y weight-loss randomized clinical trial of diets that differed in macronutrient proportions. Adjusted means for changes in body composition at 6 and 24 mo were obtained for gene main effects and interactions with a low-fat diet (20% from energy) compared with a high-fat diet (40% from energy). Interactions with protein and carbohydrate intakes were also tested. Predicted changes in glycemic control from changes in adiposity were determined by genotype and diet type. RESULTS: Significant interactions were observed for rs12255372 TT (risk genotype) and fat intake for changes in BMI, total fat mass, and trunk fat mass (all P/q < 0.05) at 6 mo, with nonsignificant larger decreases for TT carriers on a low-fat diet. No significant associations were observed at 24 mo or for other macronutrients. Changes in body composition for TT carriers predicted reductions in plasma glucose and insulin only on the low-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with the TCF7L2 rs12255372 risk genotype may reduce body adiposity by consuming a diet lower in total fat. These reductions may induce better glycemic control for such individuals predisposed to type 2 diabetes. The Pounds Lost trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00072995.

23041303|t|Association between donor and recipient TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus after liver transplantation in a Han Chinese population.
23041303|a|BACKGROUNDS _ AIMS: New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) is a frequent and serious complication arising after liver transplantation (LT). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms have been reported to strongly associate with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the donor liver plays a vital role in regulating blood glucose levels. In this study, we aim at evaluating the association between donor and recipient TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with NODM after LT. METHODS: A total of 125 patients undergoing primary LT, without a history of diabetes were included. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs290487, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372), closely associated with type 2 diabetes in the Eastern Asia population, were genotyped and analyzed. RESULTS: Both donor and recipient rs290487 polymorphisms (CC vs. TT genotype) were found to be significantly associated with NODM. In multivariate analysis, donor rs290487 genetic variation (OR = 2.172 per each C allele, p = 0.015), blood tacrolimus levels at 1 month post-LT >10 ng/ml (OR = 3.264, p = 0.017), and recipient age >55 years (OR = 2.638, p = 0.043) were identified as independent risk factors of NODM. Furthermore, donor rs290487 CC genotype could predict a high probability (>40%) of the onset of NODM. Predictive model containing donor rs290487 polymorphism showed a significantly higher prognostic ability on NODM than the model with only clinical parameters (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: Donor TCF7L2 rs290487 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of NODM after LT and has a potential clinical value for the prediction of NODM.

23050589|t|Association between the IVS4G>T mutation in the TCF7L2 gene and susceptibility to diabetes in cystic fibrosis patients.
23050589|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical complications appear to be a decisive factor for the prognosis of patients. Diabetes is an important complication of cystic fibrosis(CF). In our study we evaluated the association between the IVS4G>T mutation in the TCF7L2 gene with the presence of diabetes in patients with CF. FINDINGS: We evaluated 145 patients with CF in relation to the genotype of the IVS4G>T mutation. For this, the PCR method associated with specific enzyme digestion was used. The genotypes G/G, G/T and T/T were observed to have frequencies of 54 (37.2%), 78 (53.8%) and 13 (9%), respectively. There was no association between genotype and the occurrence of diabetes among patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, no association was found between the IVS4G>T mutation in the TCF7L2 gene and diabetes.

23073174|t|From genotype to human b cell phenotype and beyond.
23073174|a|Polygenic type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multi-factorial disease due to the interplay between genes and the environment. Over the years, several genes/loci have been associated with this type of diabetes, with the majority of them being related to b cell dysfunction. In this review, the available information on how polymorphisms in T2DM-associated genes/loci do directly affect the properties of human islet cells are presented and discussed, including some clinical implications and the role of epigenetic mechanisms.

23079471|t|Genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome.
23079471|a|Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly complex endocrine disorder, characterized by hyperandrogenemia, menstrual irregularities and polycystic ovaries. A strong genetic component to the etiology of PCOS is evident. However, due to the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of PCOS and the lack of insufficiently large cohorts, studies to identify specific contributing genes to date have yielded only few conclusive results. In this review we discuss the current status of the genetic analysis of PCOS including the results of numerous association studies with candidate genes involved in TGF-b and insulin signaling, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity susceptibility. Furthermore, we address current challenges in genetic studies of PCOS, and the promise of new approaches, including genome-wide association studies and next-generation sequencing.

23085767|t|Associations between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer among Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women: the Breast Cancer Health Disparities Study.
23085767|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is part of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway and plays a critical role in cell development and growth regulation. TCF7L2 variants rs12255372 and rs7903146 have been associated with risk of Type 2 diabetes. Few epidemiological studies have examined the association between TCF7L2 and breast cancer risk. We investigated the associations between 25 TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and breast cancer in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women from the 4-Corner's Breast Cancer Study, the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study, and the Mexico Breast Cancer Study. A total of 4,703 Hispanic (2,093 cases, 2,610 controls) and 3,031 NHW (1,431 cases, 1,600 controls) women were included. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression to estimate the association between the TCF7L2 SNPs and breast cancer risk. We also examined effect modification by self-reported ethnicity, genetic admixture, and diabetes history. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, four TCF7L2 SNPs were significantly associated with breast cancer overall: rs7903146 (OR(TT) 1.24; 95 % CI 1.03-1.49), rs3750805 (OR(AT/TT) 1.15; 95 % CI 1.03-1.28), rs7900150 (OR(AA) 1.23; 95 % 1.07-1.42), and rs1225404 (OR(CC) 0.82; 95 % 0.70-0.94). Among women with a history of diabetes, the TT genotype of rs3750804 increased breast cancer risk (OR, 2.46; 95 % CI 1.28-4.73). However, there was no association among women without a diabetes history (OR, 1.06; 95 % CI 0.85-1.32). We did not find significant interactions by ethnicity or by genetic admixture. Findings support an association between TCF7L2 and breast cancer and history of diabetes modifies this association for specific variants.

23086040|t|Adipose tissue TCF7L2 splicing is regulated by weight loss and associates with glucose and fatty acid metabolism.
23086040|a|We investigated the effects of obesity surgery-induced weight loss on transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) alternative splicing in adipose tissue and liver. Furthermore, we determined the association of TCF7L2 splicing with the levels of plasma glucose and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) in three independent studies (n = 216). Expression of the short mRNA variant, lacking exons 12, 13, and 13a, decreased after weight loss in subcutaneous fat (n = 46) and liver (n = 11) and was more common in subcutaneous fat of subjects with type 2 diabetes than in subjects with normal glucose tolerance in obese individuals (n = 54) and a population-based sample (n = 49). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between this variant and the level of fasting glucose in nondiabetic individuals (n = 113). This association between TCF7L2 splicing and plasma glucose was independent of the TCF7L2 genotype. Finally, this variant was associated with high levels of serum FFAs during hyperinsulinemia, suggesting impaired insulin action in adipose tissue, whereas no association with insulin secretion or insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose uptake was observed. Our study shows that the short TCF7L2 mRNA variant in subcutaneous fat is regulated by weight loss and is associated with hyperglycemia and impaired insulin action in adipose tissue.

23104008|t|Bayesian refinement of association signals for 14 loci in 3 common diseases.
23104008|a|To further investigate susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies, we genotyped 5,500 SNPs across 14 associated regions in 8,000 samples from a control group and 3 diseases: type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD) and Graves' disease. We defined, using Bayes theorem, credible sets of SNPs that were 95% likely, based on posterior probability, to contain the causal disease-associated SNPs. In 3 of the 14 regions, TCF7L2 (T2D), CTLA4 (Graves' disease) and CDKN2A-CDKN2B (T2D), much of the posterior probability rested on a single SNP, and, in 4 other regions (CDKN2A-CDKN2B (CAD) and CDKAL1, FTO and HHEX (T2D)), the 95% sets were small, thereby excluding most SNPs as potentially causal. Very few SNPs in our credible sets had annotated functions, illustrating the limitations in understanding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to common diseases. Our results also show the value of more detailed mapping to target sequences for functional studies.

23132673|t|Diabetes and obesity-related genes and the risk of neural tube defects in the national birth defects prevention study.
23132673|a|Few studies have evaluated genetic susceptibility related to diabetes and obesity as a risk factor for neural tube defects (NTDs). The authors investigated 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms among 9 genes (ADRB3, ENPP1, FTO, LEP, PPARG, PPARGC1A, SLC2A2, TCF7L2, and UCP2) associated with type 2 diabetes or obesity. Samples were obtained from 737 NTD case-parent triads included in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study during 1999-2007. Log-linear models were used to evaluate maternal and offspring genetic effects. After application of the false discovery rate, there were 5 significant maternal genetic effects. The less common alleles at the 4 FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a reduction of NTD risk (for rs1421085, relative risk (RR) = 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62, 0.87); for rs8050136, RR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93); for rs9939609, RR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.94); and for rs17187449, RR = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.95)). Additionally, maternal LEP rs2071045 (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.60) and offspring UCP2 rs660339 (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.64) were associated with NTD risk. Furthermore, the maternal genotype for TCF7L2 rs3814573 suggested an increased NTD risk among obese women. These findings indicate that maternal genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis may modify the risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy.

23142382|t|Transcription factor-7-like 2 gene variants are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in Tunisian Arab subjects.
23142382|a|Genome-wide association studies validated transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene as confirmed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) susceptibility locus, and an ethnic contribution of TCF7L2 variants to T2DM risk was indicated. The aim of this study was to replicate in a Tunisian Arab population identified associations of common TCF7L2 variants with T2DM. We tested the association of TCF7L2 variants: rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, and rs12255372, with T2DM in 900 Tunisian patients and 875 control subjects. TCF7L2 genotyping was done by allelic discrimination/real-time PCR method. Minor allele frequencies of rs4506565 (P=2.4 10(-8)), rs7903146 (P=1.2 10(-6)), rs12243326 (P=8.4 10(-8)) and rs12255372 (P=1.1 10(-5)) were significantly higher in cases. The four tested TCF7L2 variants were in linkage disequilibrium, and 4-locus (rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, rs12255372) haplotype analysis demonstrated that haplotype 1111 was negatively associated (Pc<0.001), while haplotypes 2222 (Pc=0.008) and 2211 (Pc=0.020) were positively associated with T2DM risk, after controlling for a number of covariates. The strong contribution of TCF7L2 gene variants to T2DM among Tunisians is in line with similar findings in other ethnic groups, confirming TCF7L2 as a common T2DM candidate gene.

23144361|t|Evaluation of genome-wide association study-identified type 2 diabetes loci in African Americans.
23144361|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is up to twice as prevalent among African Americans as Caucasians. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common genetic risk variants for T2D; however, none of these studies were conducted exclusively among subjects of African ancestry. Investigating these known loci in other populations would be an expedient way to evaluate the generalizability of the current findings. The authors evaluated 29 known T2D loci in a large southeastern US cohort study including 4,288 African Americans (1,554 cases and 2,734 controls) enrolled during 2002-2009. Seven of the 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) examined were found to be associated with T2D risk at P  <= 0.05, including rs6769511 (IGF2BP2), 2 SNPs in the WFS1 gene (rs4689388 and rs1801214), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), and 3 SNPs in the KCNQ1 gene (rs231362, rs2237892, and rs2237897). Notably, the association for rs7903146 reached the GWAS significance level (P = 3.6   10(-8)), with an odds ratio per T allele of 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.20, 1.46). Regional analyses using GWAS data from Vanderbilt University's BioVU DNA biobank showed significant associations (P < 0.05) with 9 loci, though no association was observed for the index SNPs reported in European- or Asian-ancestry populations. These results extend some of the recent GWAS findings to African Americans and may guide future efforts to identify causal variants for T2D.

23188737|t|TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes risk: a comprehensive and updated meta-analysis involving 121,174 subjects.
23188737|a|Recently, many new loci associated with type 2 diabetes have been uncovered by genetic association studies and genome-wide association studies. As more reports are made, particularly with respect to varying ethnicities, there is a need to determine more precisely the effect sizes in each major racial group. In addition, some reports have claimed ethnic-specific associations with alternative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and to that end there has been a degree of confusion. We conducted a meta-analysis using an additive genetic model. Eight polymorphisms in 155 studies with 121174 subjects (53385 cases and 67789 controls) were addressed in this meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between type 2 diabetes and rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs7901695, rs7895340 and rs4506565, with summary odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval) of 1.39 (1.34-1.45), 1.33 (1.27-1.40), 1.20 (1.14-1.26), 1.32 (1.25-1.39), 1.21 (1.13-1.29) and 1.39 (1.29-1.49), respectively. In addition, no significant associations were found between the two polymorphisms (rs290487 and rs11196218) and type 2 diabetes. The summary ORs for the six statistically significant associations (P < 0.05) were further evaluated by estimating the false-positive report probability, with results indicating that all of the six significant associations were considered noteworthy, and may plausibly be true associations. Significant associations were found between the six polymorphisms (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs7901695, rs7895340 and rs4506565) in the TCF7L2 gene and type 2 diabetes risk, and the other two polymorphisms (rs11196218 and rs290487) were not found to be significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Subgroups analyses show that significant associations are not found between the six SNPs (rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, rs7901695, rs7895340, and rs4506565) and the type 2 diabetes in some ethnic populations.

23193118|t|Association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants with advanced prostate cancer risk in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium.
23193118|a|Observational studies have found an inverse association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prostate cancer (PCa), and genome-wide association studies have found common variants near 3 loci associated with both diseases. The authors examined whether a genetic background that favors T2D is associated with risk of advanced PCa. Data from the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, a genome-wide association study of 2,782 advanced PCa cases and 4,458 controls, were used to evaluate whether individual single nucleotide polymorphisms or aggregations of these 36 T2D susceptibility loci are associated with PCa. Ten T2D markers near 9 loci (NOTCH2, ADCY5, JAZF1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, MTNR1B, FTO, and HNF1B) were nominally associated with PCa (P < 0.05); the association for single nucleotide polymorphism rs757210 at the HNF1B locus was significant when multiple comparisons were accounted for (adjusted P = 0.001). Genetic risk scores weighted by the T2D log odds ratio and multilocus kernel tests also indicated a significant relation between T2D variants and PCa risk. A mediation analysis of 9,065 PCa cases and 9,526 controls failed to produce evidence that diabetes mediates the association of the HNF1B locus with PCa risk. These data suggest a shared genetic component between T2D and PCa and add to the evidence for an interrelation between these diseases.

23193183|t|Transferability and fine mapping of type 2 diabetes loci in African Americans: the Candidate Gene Association Resource Plus Study.
23193183|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionally affects African Americans (AfA) but, to date, genetic variants identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are primarily from European and Asian populations. We examined the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and locus transferability of 40 reported T2D loci in six AfA GWAS consisting of 2,806 T2D case subjects with or without end-stage renal disease and 4,265 control subjects from the Candidate Gene Association Resource Plus Study. Our results revealed that seven index SNPs at the TCF7L2, KLF14, KCNQ1, ADCY5, CDKAL1, JAZF1, and GCKR loci were significantly associated with T2D (P < 0.05). The strongest association was observed at TCF7L2 rs7903146 (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; P = 6.86 * 10      ). Locus-wide analysis demonstrated significant associations (P(emp) < 0.05) at regional best SNPs in the TCF7L2, KLF14, and HMGA2 loci as well as suggestive signals in KCNQ1 after correction for the effective number of SNPs at each locus. Of these loci, the regional best SNPs were in differential linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the index and adjacent SNPs. Our findings suggest that some loci discovered in prior reports affect T2D susceptibility in AfA with similar effect sizes. The reduced and differential LD pattern in AfA compared with European and Asian populations may facilitate fine mapping of causal variants at loci shared across populations.

23235198|t|Consumption of whole grain reduces risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance, including progression to prediabetes.
23235198|a|BACKGROUND: High whole-grain intake has been reportedly associated with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is an effect possibly subject to genetic effect modification. Confirmation in prospective studies and investigations on the impact on prediabetes is needed. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective population-based study, we investigated whether a higher intake of whole grain protects against the development of prediabetes and T2D and tested for modulation by polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene. DESIGN: We examined the 8-10-y incidence of prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or the combination of both) and T2D in relation to the intake of whole grain. Baseline data were available for 3180 women and 2297 men aged 35-56 y. RESULTS: A higher intake of whole grain (>59.1 compared with <30.6 g/d) was associated with a 34% lower risk to deteriorate in glucose tolerance (to prediabetes or T2D; women and men combined). The association remained after adjustments for age, family history of diabetes, BMI, physical activity, smoking, education, and blood pressure (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.96). Risk reduction was significant in men (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85) but not in women. Associations were significant for prediabetes per se (all, OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94; men, OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.80). The intake of whole grain correlated inversely with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The impact of whole-grain intake was undetectable in men who harbored diabetogenic polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: A higher intake of whole grain is associated with decreased risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance including progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes by mechanisms likely tied to effects on insulin sensitivity. Effect modifications by TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms are supported.

23249316|t|Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes: a global meta-analysis studying the genetic differences in Tunisian populations.
23249316|a|The present study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate type 2 diabetes (T2D)- associated polymorphisms in cohorts originated from several Tunisian regions. In fact, we evaluated the effect of seven polymorphisms in the following genes-PPARg (Pro12Ala), TNFa (-308A/G), ENPP1(K121Q), TCF7L2(rs7903146  C/T), MTHFR(C677T), ACE(I/D), and CAPN10(3R/2R)-on T2D risk, through a meta-analysis combining data of previous studies performed on Tunisian populations originating from the north, center, or south of the country. R statistics version 2.12.1 software was used to estimate the heterogeneity between studies. Pooled odds ratios were computed by the fixed-effects method of Mantel-Haenszel if no heterogeneity between studies exists. Despite the similarities founded in a number of loci, the Woolf test reported that the contributions of ENPP1 and ACE loci in T2D risk are dependent on the geographic origin of concerned groups, and this heterogeneity could be attributed not only to the variable contribution of the variant in T2D risk but also to diversities of genetic background between tested groups. Interestingly, observed heterogeneity highlighted founding concerning Y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA about the genetic structure of Tunisian population and proves once again that Tunisians, like the north-Africans, are a mosaic of subpopulations, with significant differences in genetic structure. In homogeneous groups, we replicated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TCF7L2, MTHFR, CAPN 10, TNFa, and ACE genes with a T2D risk in the Tunisian population with OR ranging from 1.43 to 6.72. However, we reported an absence of the association of PPARg with T2D in the Tunisian population.

23260145|t|Diabetes risk gene and Wnt effector Tcf7l2/TCF4 controls hepatic response to perinatal and adult metabolic demand.
23260145|a|Most studies on TCF7L2 SNP variants in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) focus on a role of the encoded transcription factor TCF4 in b cells. Here, a mouse genetics approach shows that removal of TCF4 from b cells does not affect their function, whereas manipulating TCF4 levels in the liver has major effects on metabolism. In Tcf7l2(-/-) mice, the immediate postnatal surge in liver metabolism does not occur. Consequently, pups die due to hypoglycemia. By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with gene expression profiling, we identify a TCF4-controlled metabolic gene program that is  acutely activated in the postnatal liver. In concordance, adult liver-specific Tcf7l2 knockout mice  show reduced hepatic glucose production during fasting and display improved glucose homeostasis when maintained on high-fat diet. Furthermore, liver-specific TCF4 overexpression increases hepatic glucose production. These observations imply that TCF4 directly activates metabolic genes and that inhibition of Wnt signaling may be beneficial in metabolic disease.

23281828|t|Genome-wide meta-analysis of genetic susceptible genes for Type 2 Diabetes.
23281828|a|BACKGROUND: Many genetic studies, including single gene studies and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), aim to identify risk alleles for genetic diseases such as Type II Diabetes (T2D). However, in T2D studies, there is a significant amount of the hereditary risk that cannot be simply explained by individual risk genes. There is a need for developing systems biology approaches to integrate comprehensive genetic information and provide new insight on T2D biology. METHODS: We performed comprehensive integrative analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP's) individually curated from T2D GWAS results and mapped them to T2D candidate risk genes. Using protein-protein interaction data, we constructed a T2D-specific molecular interaction network consisting of T2D genetic risk genes and their interacting gene partners. We then studied the relationship between these T2D genes and curated gene sets. RESULTS: We determined that T2D candidate risk genes are concentrated in certain parts of the genome, specifically in chromosome 20. Using the T2D genetic network, we identified highly-interconnected network "hub" genes. By incorporating T2D GWAS results, T2D pathways, and T2D genes' functional category information, we further ranked T2D risk genes, T2D-related pathways, and T2D-related functional categories. We found that highly-interconnected T2D disease network "hub" genes most highly associated to T2D genetic risks to be PI3KR1, ESR1, and ENPP1. The well-characterized TCF7L2, contractor to our expectation, was not among the highest-ranked T2D gene list. Many interacted pathways play a role in T2D genetic risks, which includes insulin signalling pathway, type II diabetes pathway, maturity onset diabetes of the young, adipocytokine signalling pathway, and pathways in cancer. We also observed significant crosstalk among T2D gene subnetworks which include insulin secretion, regulation of insulin secretion, response to peptide hormone stimulus, response to insulin stimulus, peptide secretion, glucose homeostasis, and hormone transport. Overview maps involving T2D genes, gene sets, pathways, and their interactions are all reported. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale systems biology meta-analyses of GWAS results can improve interpretations of genetic variations and genetic risk factors. T2D genetic risks can be attributable to the summative genetic effects of many genes involved in a broad range of signalling pathways and functional networks. The framework developed for T2D studies may serve as a guide for studying other complex diseases.

23295285|t|Association of the rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism at the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) locus with type 2 diabetes in Brazilian subjects.
23295285|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 of TCF7L2 with the occurrence of T2D in a sample of subjects followed up at the Brasilia University Hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The SNP rs7903146 of TCF7L2 was genotyped by allele-specific PCR in 113 patients with known T2D and in 139 non-diabetic controls in Brasilia, Brazil. RESULTS: We found that the T allele of the SNP rs7903146 of TCF7L2 was significantly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio of 3.92 for genotype TT in the recessive genetic model, p = 0.004 and 1.5 for T allele, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: These results reinforce previous findings on the consistent association of this genetic factor and the risk of T2D in populations of diverse ethnic backgrounds.

23311683|t|Meta-analysis of associations between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Chinese population.
23311683|a|BACKGROUND: Associations between transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been evaluated extensively in multiple ethnic groups. TCF7L2 has emerged as the strongest T2DM susceptibility gene in Europeans, but the findings have been inconsistent in the Chinese population. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the associations between TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and T2DM risk in the Chinese population. METHODS: We performed searches in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Chinese databases (CNKI, CQVIP and Wanfang databases) for literature published from January 2007 to February 2012. We reviewed all relevant articles on TCF7L2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to T2DM in the Chinese population written in English and Chinese. Two reviewers extracted data independently using a standardized protocol, and any discrepancies were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to pool the odds ratios (ORs). Publication bias and heterogeneity were examined. RESULTS: A total of 21 articles were confirmed to be eligible for and included in this meta-analysis: 7 (with 3942 cases and 3502 controls) concerning rs11196218 (IVS-/+4G>A), 8 (with 3377 cases and 2975 controls) concerning rs290487 (IVS3-/+C>T), and 14 (with 7902 cases and 7436 controls) concerning rs7903146 (IVS3-/+C>T). Overall, the results showed a significant association between rs7903146 and T2DM risk. The pooled ORs were 1.54 for the comparison of T and C alleles (95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.37-1.74, p = 1.47   10-12, I2 = 25.20%) and 1.56 for TC heterozygotes and CC homozygotes (95% CI : 1.38-1.76, p = 8.25   10-9, I2 = 21.00%). The rs11196218(IVS4G>A) and rs290487 (IVS3C>T) SNPs were not associated with T2DM risk. CONCLUSIONS: The rs7903146 SNP of the TCF7L2 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to T2DM in the Chinese population as a whole as well as northern Chinese and southern Chinese as subgroups.

23314611|t|New insight into the mechanisms underlying the function of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 in pancreatic b-cells: the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway effector b-catenin.
23314611|a|During the past two decades, the exploration of function of two incretin hormones, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), has led to the development of two categories of novel therapeutic agents for diabetes and its complications, known as GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors. Mechanisms underlying the function of GLP-1, however, still need to be further explored. GLP-1 not only functions as an incretin hormone in stimulating insulin secretion in response to nutritional, hormonal and neuronal stimulations, but also acts as an "insulin-like" factor in b-cell and extra-pancreatic organs. In addition to these insulinotropic and insulinomimetic effects, GLP-1 was shown to exert its protective effect in b-cell by repressing the expression of TxNIP, a mediator of glucolipotoxicity. A number of recent studies have shown that the Wnt signaling pathway effector, the bipartite transcription factor b-catenin/TCF, controls not only the production of GLP-1, but also the function of GLP-1. Furthermore, previously assumed "degradation" products of GLP-1(7-36)amide, including GLP-1(9-36)amide and GLP-1(28-36)amide, have been shown to exert beneficial effect in pancreas and extra-pancreatic tissues or cell lineages. Here we summarized our current knowledge on the metabolic, proliferative and protective effects of GLP-1(7-36)amide and its cleavage fragments, mainly focusing on pancreatic b-cells and the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway effector b-catenin.

23349771|t|Association study of 25 type 2 diabetes related Loci with measures of obesity in Indian sib pairs.
23349771|a|Obesity is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and they are metabolically related through the mechanism of insulin resistance. In order to explore how common genetic variants associated with T2D correlate with body mass index (BMI), we examined the influence of 25 T2D associated loci on obesity risk. We used 5056 individuals (2528 sib-pairs) recruited in Indian Migration Study and conducted within sib-pair analysis for six obesity phenotypes. We found associations of variants in CXCR4 (rs932206) and HHEX (rs5015480) with higher body mass index (BMI) (b=0.13, p=0.001) and (b=0.09, p=0.002), respectively and weight (b=0.13, p=0.001) and (b=0.09, p=0.001), respectively. CXCR4 variant was also strongly associated with body fat (b=0.10, p=0.0004). In addition, we demonstrated associations of CXCR4 and HHEX with overweight/obesity (OR=1.6, p=0.003) and (OR=1.4, p=0.002), respectively, in 1333 sib-pairs (2666 individuals). We observed marginal evidence of associations between variants at six loci (TCF7L2, NGN3, FOXA2, LOC646279, FLJ39370 and THADA) and waist hip ratio (WHR), BMI and/or overweight which needs to be validated in larger set of samples. All the above findings were independent of daily energy consumption and physical activity level. The risk score estimates based on eight significant loci (including nominal associations) showed associations with WHR and body fat which were independent of BMI. In summary, we establish the role of T2D associated loci in influencing the measures of obesity in Indian population, suggesting common underlying pathophysiology across populations.

23395167|t|LRP6 enhances glucose metabolism by promoting TCF7L2-dependent insulin receptor expression and IGF receptor stabilization in humans.
23395167|a|Common genetic variations in Wnt signaling genes have been associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes by mechanisms that are poorly understood. A rare nonconservative mutation in Wnt coreceptor LRP6 (LRP6(R611C)) has been shown to underlie autosomal dominant early onset coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. We examined the interplay between Wnt and insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle and skin fibroblasts of healthy nondiabetic LRP6(R611C) mutation carriers. LRP6 mutation carriers exhibited hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin sensitivity compared to noncarrier relatives in response to oral glucose ingestion, which correlated with a significant decline in tissue expression of the insulin receptor and insulin signaling activity. Further investigations showed that the LRP6(R611C) mutation diminishes TCF7L2-dependent transcription of the IR while it increases the stability of IGFR and enhances mTORC1 activity. These findings identify the Wnt/LRP6/TCF7L2 axis as a regulator of glucose metabolism and a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance.

23434931|t|TCF7L2 variation and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
23434931|a|Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most severe vision-threatening complication of diabetes. For investigation of genetic association between TCF7L2 and PDR in Caucasian type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its functional consequences, 383 T2DM patients with PDR (T2DM-PDR) and 756 T2DM patients without diabetic retinopathy (T2DM-no DR) were genotyped with rs7903146 in TCF7L2. We found that risk allele (T) frequency of rs7903146 was significantly higher in T2DM-PDR patients (allelic P = 2.52E-04). In lymphoblastoid cells induced to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by treatment of tunicamycin, higher fold change of TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels were observed in rs7903146-TT cells than in rs7903146-CC cells (P = 0.02 for TCF7L2; P = 0.004 for VEGFA), suggesting that ER stress plays a role in PDR pathogenesis. Silencing TCF7L2 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of both TCF7L2 and VEGFA (P < 0.001). Retinas of oxygen-induced retinopathy mice (a model for PDR) had higher TCF7L2 and VEGFA mRNA levels than those of controls (P = 2.9E-04 for TCF7L2; P = 1.9E-07 for VEGFA). Together, data from our study show that TCF7L2-rs7903146 is associated with PDR in Caucasian T2DM and suggest that TCF7L2 promotes pathological retinal neovascularization via ER stress-dependent upregulation of VEGFA.

23448427|t|Assessing the contribution of 38 genetic loci to the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Saudi Arabian Population.
23448427|a|BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide association studies have identified multiple type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic risk loci in many populations. However, the contribution of these loci to T2D in the Middle Eastern populations with high T2D prevalence is unknown. METHODS: Here, we investigated the association of 38 T2D risk loci in the Saudi Arabian population (1166 patients with T2D and 1235 healthy controls), which has one of the world's highest prevalence of T2D. RESULTS: Eight common genetic variants showed a significant association with T2D in our study population. The effect sizes of these loci were comparable to those previously identified in other populations with the exception of HNF4A, which showed a trend for larger effect size in our study population (OR = 1  27) compared to that reported in South Asian populations (OR = 1  09; I(2) = 65  9). Analysis of risk allele scores (RASs) defined by the 8 loci showed that subjects in the top RAS quintile (n = 480) had 2  5-fold increase in disease risk compared to those in the bottom quintile (n = 480; P = 9  5   10(-12)). RASs were also associated with fasting glucose level (b = 0  12; P = 2  2   10(-9)), but not with BMI (P = 0  19). Analysis of a subgroup of subjects with BMI <=30 resulted in two additional loci (SLC30A8; P = 0  03, HMG20A; P = 0  02) showing significant association with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that variants at WFS1, JAZF1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, HMG20A, HNF4A and DUSP9 are associated with T2D in the Saudi population. Our findings also suggest substantial overlap of T2D risk loci across many ethnic groups regardless of disease prevalence.

23456907|t|Maternal genotype and gestational diabetes.
23456907|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis are associated with gestational diabetes (GDM). STUDY DESIGN: We genotyped 899 self-identified Caucasian women and 386 self-identified African-American women in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Studies cohorts for 38 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type II diabetes (T2DM) and/or glucose homeostasis in European populations. RESULTS: GDM was diagnosed in 56 of 899 (6.2%) Caucasian and 24 of 386 (6.2%) African-American women. Among Caucasian women, GDM was associated with carriage of TCF7L2 rs7901695, MTNR1B rs10830963 and GCKR rs780094 alleles that are associated with T2DM and fasting glucose in nonpregnant populations. Among African-American participants, we found an increased risk among TSPAN8 rs7961581 C allele homozygotes and reduced risk among carriers of the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele. CONCLUSION: We found several SNPs that are associated with GDM risk in the PIN cohorts. Maternal genotyping may identify women at risk for impaired gestational glucose tolerance.

23458876|t|ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms are significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in Arab ethnicity: a meta-analysis.
23458876|a|In this meta-analysis study, SNPs were investigated for their association with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in both Arab and Caucasian ethnicities. A total of 55 SNPs were analyzed, of which 11 fulfilled the selection criteria, and were used for analysis. It was found that TCF7L2 rs7903146 was significantly associated with a pooled OR of 1.155 (95%C.I.=1.059-1.259), p<0.0001 and I(2)=78.30% among the Arab population, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 1.45 (95%C.I.=1.386-1.516), p<0.0001 and I(2)=77.20%. KCNJ11 rs5219 was significantly associated in both the populations with a pooled OR of 1.176(1.092-1.268), p<0.0001 and I(2)=32.40% in Caucasians and a pooled OR of 1.28(1.111-1.475), p=0.001 among Arabs. The ACE I/D polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with a pooled OR of 1.992 (95%C.I.=1.774-2.236), p<0.0001 and I(2)=83.20% among the Arab population, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 1.078 (95%C.I.=0.993-1.17), p=0.073 and I(2)=0%. Similarly, MTHFR C677T polymorphism was also found to be significantly associated among Arabs with a pooled OR of 1.924 (95%C.I.=1.606-2.304), p<0.0001 and I(2)=27.20%, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 0.986 (95%C.I.=0.868-1.122), p=0.835 and I(2)=0%. Meanwhile PPARG-2 Pro12Ala, CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, HHEX rs7923837, CDKAL1 rs7754840, EXT2 rs1113132 and SLC30A8 rs13266634 were found to have no significant association with T2D among Arabs. In conclusion, it seems from this study that both Arabs and Caucasians have different SNPs associated with T2D. Moreover, this study sheds light on the profound necessity for further investigations addressing the question of the genetic components of T2D in Arabs.

23462794|t|Identification of CpG-SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes and differential DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets.
23462794|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To date, the molecular function of most of the reported type 2 diabetes-associated loci remains unknown. The introduction or removal of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, which are possible sites of DNA methylation, has been suggested as a potential mechanism through which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect gene function via epigenetics. The aim of this study was to examine if any of 40 SNPs previously associated with type 2 diabetes introduce or remove a CpG site and if these CpG-SNPs are associated with differential DNA methylation in pancreatic islets of 84 human donors. METHODS: DNA methylation was analysed using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: We found that 19 of 40 (48%) type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs introduce or remove a CpG site. Successful DNA methylation data were generated for 16 of these 19 CpG-SNP loci, representing the candidate genes TCF7L2, KCNQ1, PPARG, HHEX, CDKN2A, SLC30A8, DUSP9, CDKAL1, ADCY5, SRR, WFS1, IRS1, DUSP8, HMGA2, TSPAN8 and CHCHD9. All analysed CpG-SNPs were associated with differential DNA methylation of the CpG-SNP site in human islets. Moreover, six CpG-SNPs, representing TCF7L2, KCNQ1, CDKN2A, ADCY5, WFS1 and HMGA2, were also associated with DNA methylation of surrounding CpG sites. Some of the type 2 diabetes CpG-SNP sites that exhibit differential DNA methylation were further associated with gene expression, alternative splicing events determined by splice index, and hormone secretion in the human islets. The 19 type 2 diabetes-associated CpG-SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (r   > 0.8) with a total of 295 SNPs, including 91 CpG-SNPs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the introduction or removal of a CpG site may be a molecular mechanism through which some of the type 2 diabetes SNPs affect gene function via differential DNA methylation and consequently contributes to the phenotype of the disease.

23492873|t|Recommendations from the EGAPP Working Group: does genomic profiling to assess type 2 diabetes risk improve health outcomes?
23492873|a|SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS: The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) Working Group (EWG) found insufficient evidence to recommend testing for predictive variants in 28 variants (listed in Table 1) to assess risk for type 2 diabetes in the general population, on the basis of studies in populations of northern European descent. The EWG found that the magnitude of net health benefit from the use of any of these tests alone or in combination is close to zero. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.The EWG found insufficient evidence to recommend testing for the TCF7L2 gene to assess risk for type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. The EWG found that the magnitude of net health benefit from the use of this test is close to zero. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.On the basis of the available evidence for both the scenarios, the overall certainty of net health benefit is deemed "low." RATIONALE: It has been suggested that genomic profiling in the general population or in high-risk populations for type 2 diabetes might lead to management changes (e.g., earlier initiation or higher rates of medical interventions, or targeted recommendations for behavioral change) that improve type 2 diabetes outcomes or prevent type 2 diabetes. The EWG found no direct evidence to support this possibility; therefore, this review sought indirect evidence aimed at documenting the extent to which genomic profiling alters type 2 diabetes risk estimation, alone and in combination with traditional risk factors, and the extent to which risk classification improves health outcomes. ANALYTIC VALIDITY: Assay-related evidence on available genomic profiling tests was deemed inadequate. However, on the basis of existing technologies that have been or may be used, the analytic sensitivity and specificity of tests for individual gene variants might be at least satisfactory. CLINICAL VALIDITY: Twenty-eight candidate markers were evaluated in the general population. Evidence on clinical validity was rated inadequate for 24 of these associations (86%) and adequate for 4 (14%). Inadequate grades were based on limited evidence, poor replication, existence of possible biases, or combinations of these factors. Type 2 diabetes genomic profiling provided areas under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 55%-57%, with 4, 8, and 28 genes. Only TCF7L2 had convincing evidence of an association with type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 1.33-1.46).TCF7L2 was evaluated for high-risk populations, and the overall odds ratio was 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.22-2.27) for association with progression to type 2 diabetes. CLINICAL UTILITY: No studies were available to provide direct evidence on the balance of benefits and harms for genetic profiling for type 2 diabetes alone or in addition to traditional risk factors in the general population.Evidence for high-risk populations and TCF7L2 was inadequate on the basis of two identified studies. These studies found close to zero additional benefit with the addition of genomic markers to traditional risk factors (diet, body mass index, and glucose tolerance). CONTEXTUAL ISSUES: Prevention of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority. Improvements in the outcomes associated with genomic profiling could have important impacts. Traditional risk factors (e.g., body mass index, weight, fat mass, and exercise) have an advantage in clinical screening and risk assessment strategies because they measure the actual targets for therapy (e.g., fasting plasma glucose and medical interventions). To be useful in predicting disease risk, genomic testing should improve the predictive value of these traditional risk factors. Some issues important for clinical utility remain unknown, such as the level of risk that changes intervention, whether long-term disease outcomes will improve, how individuals being tested will understand/respond to test results and interact with the health-care system, and whether testing will motivate behavior change or amplify potential harms.

23492876|t|Use of genomic panels to determine risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the general population: a targeted evidence-based review.
23492876|a|This evidence review addresses whether type 2 diabetes genomic risk panels improve health outcomes (e.g., reduce rates of developing type 2 diabetes) in low- or high-risk adults; two clinical scenarios promulgated by commercial companies offering such testing. Evidence for the analytic validity of available genomic profiles was inadequate. Clinical validity ranged from inadequate to convincing for 30 variants identified on five type 2 diabetes genomic panels and by genome-wide association studies. Eight common variants were identified for general population use; evidence credibility based on published criteria was strong for two variants, moderate for two variants, and weak for four variants. TCF7L2 had the largest per-allele odds ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.33-1.46). Models combining the best four, best eight, and all 30 variants used summary effect sizes, reported genotype frequencies, and assumed independent effects. Areas under the curve were 0.547, 0.551, and 0.570, respectively. In high-risk populations, per-allele odds ratios for TCF7L2 alone were similar to those of the general population. TCF7L2, in combination with other variants, yielded minimal improvement in risk reclassification. Evidence on TCF7L2 clinical validity was adequate. Three studies addressed the clinical utility of intervention effectiveness, stratified by TCF7L2 genotype; none found significant interactions. Clinical utility evidence was inadequate. In addition to analytic validity and clinical utility knowledge gaps, additional gaps were identified regarding how to inform, produce, and evaluate models combining multiple variants.

23527042|t|Replication of type 2 diabetes candidate genes variations in three geographically unrelated Indian population groups.
23527042|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a syndrome of multiple metabolic disorders and is genetically heterogeneous. India comprises one of the largest global populations with highest number of reported type 2 diabetes cases. However, limited information about T2D associated loci is available for Indian populations. It is, therefore, pertinent to evaluate the previously associated candidates as well as identify novel genetic variations in Indian populations to understand the extent of genetic heterogeneity. We chose to do a cost effective high-throughput mass-array genotyping and studied the candidate gene variations associated with T2D in literature. In this case-control candidate genes association study, 91 SNPs from 55 candidate genes have been analyzed in three geographically independent population groups from India. We report the genetic variants in five candidate genes: TCF7L2, HHEX, ENPP1, IDE and FTO, are significantly associated (after Bonferroni correction, p<5.5E-04) with T2D susceptibility in combined population. Interestingly, SNP rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene passed the genome wide significance threshold (combined P value=2.05E-08) in the studied populations. We also observed the association of rs7903146 with blood glucose (fasting and postprandial) levels, supporting the role of TCF7L2 gene in blood glucose homeostasis. Further, we noted that the moderate risk provided by the independently associated loci in combined population with Odds Ratio (OR)<1.38 increased to OR=2.44, (95%CI=1.67-3.59) when the risk providing genotypes of TCF7L2, HHEX, ENPP1 and FTO genes were combined, suggesting the importance of gene-gene interactions evaluation in complex disorders like T2D.

23527206|t|The association between gene polymorphism of TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population: a meta-analysis.
23527206|a|In recent years, it has been widely accepted that transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in multiple ethnic groups, especially its single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs7903146C/T, rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C. However, the results previously obtained in Chinese Han population are often inconsistent. For clearing this issue, herein we performed meta-analysis based on the reports that can be found to assess the association. In the meta-analysis, Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated with random-effect model or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity analysis. The quality of included studies was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The sensitivity analysis was used to confirm the reliability and stability of the meta-analysis. In total, 20 case-control studies with 9122 cases of T2DM and 8017 controls were included. Among these case-control studies, we selected 13 ones on rs7903146 C/T, 5 ones on rs12255372 G/T, 8 ones on rs290487 T/C. The results indicated that rs7903146C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM (T vs. C, OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.39-2.16). There was no evidence that rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C polymorphisms increased T2DM risk (T vs. G, OR=1.77, 95% CI=0.88-3.56; C vs. T, OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.93-1.25). Subgroup analysis of different regions proved the relationship between rs7903146C/T polymorphism and T2DM risk in both the northern and the southern China. The association of rs290487 with T2DM was affected by body mass index, whereas the association of rs7903146 and rs290487 with T2DM was influenced neither by age nor by sex. In conclusion, this study indicated that the rs7903146C/T polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene had a significant effect on T2DM risk in Chinese Han population, with rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C polymorphisms showing no significant effect.

23536853|t|Association of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms in TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes in 9,619 Han Chinese population.
23536853|a|AIMS: We aimed to replicate the association of the rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China. METHODS: In all, 1,842 patients with T2DM and 7,777 normal glucose-tolerant controls underwent genotyping for the T2DM-associated variants rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T). W performed a meta-analysis of the association of the risk alleles of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) in TCF7L2 and T2DM in Han Chinese by combining previous studies with the present study. RESULTS: We found that T2DM was associated with the CC genotype (1.364, 1.137-1.636, p =0.001), the recessive model (1.457, 1.156-1.838, p =0.001) of rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and haplotype CC (1.116, 1.034-1.204, p =0.004) in Han Chinese. Moreover, our meta-analyses supported the association of the T allele (IVS3C/T) of rs7903146 (1.36, 1.24-1.48; p =6.404 10(-12)) and T2DM but not the C allele of rs290487 (IVS3C/T) (0.99, 0.85-1.15, p =0.890) in Han Chinese. We found no interactions between behavioral risk factors (smoking, alcohol drinking, and physical activity) and rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The CC genotype and the recessive model of the variant rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and CC haplotype of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) in TCF7L2 may be associated with T2DM in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China.

23558246|t|Impacts of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility of hepatogenous diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients.
23558246|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatogenous diabetes (HD) occurs as a complication of cirrhosis. Whether genetic factors, rather than only liver damage, play roles in the development of HD is unknown. TCF7L2 gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes and also cancer risks. We aim to evaluate the impact of TCF7L2 gene on the susceptibility of HD and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese Han population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 367 adult liver transplant candidates with liver cirrhosis were included. Fifteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from HapMap CHB database with a minor allele frequency of >0.2 and r(2) of >0.8. Another three SNPs were also chosen because of their close association with type 2 diabetes in East Asian. RESULTS: Patients with HD presented significantly poorer liver function, higher incidence of cirrhotic complications and higher insulin resistance compared with non-HD patients. Three SNPs were differentially distributed between HD patients and non-HD patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, TCF7L2 rs290487 and rs6585194 polymorphisms were independently associated with HD after adjustment of clinical factors. The TCF7L2 rs290487 C/C variant homozygote showed much higher insulin resistance and significantly increased HD risk comparing with T/T and T/C genotypes, while the genetic variant of rs6585194 was protectively against HD. Three SNPs (rs290481, rs290487 and rs290489) located near the 3' end of TCF7L2 gene were associated with HCC risk with marginal significance. Patients carrying G-C-A haplotype had a significantly higher HCC risk than those with A-T-G. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 polymorphisms were associated with HD and maybe cancer risk as well. Further studies with large samples are needed to verify these results.

23577093|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with T2DM in the population of Hyderabad, India.
23577093|a|We attempt to evaluate the nature of association of TCF7L2 gene variants with T2DM, for the first time in the population of Hyderabad, which is considered to be diabetic capital of India. It is a case-control study of the three SNPs of TCF7L2, rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11196205, genotyped on Sequenom Massarray platform, in a sample of 758 patients and 621 controls. The risk allele frequency of the three SNPs was found to be significantly higher in the T2DM cases than controls, implicating susceptibility for diabetes (p<0.01). The greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146. Further, the logistic regression of genotypes of each SNP under log additive model, and the haplotypes constituted by at least one of the three risk alleles also show significantly greater risk of developing T2DM when compared to the wild type haplotype. Further, BMI and WHR emerge as significant covariates with confounding effects. The strong association of the TCF7L2 SNPs with T2DM is consistent with the findings among other Indian and Non-Indian populations, suggesting universal phenomena of its association across ethnic groups globally, both within and outside the Indian subcontinent, albeit the functional relevance of these SNPs needs yet to be established.

23577239|t|Genetics of obesity and type 2 diabetes in African Americans.
23577239|a|Obesity and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the impact of these conditions may be worse on historically underserved minorities, particularly African Americans. Genetic ancestry and differences in physiology are unlikely to be the sole or primary determinants of these disparities. In addition, research in this area has the ethically problematic possibility of conflating race with biology. Despite these important considerations and the challenges of conducting this work, population-based approaches for investigating the etiology of obesity and T2D may yield useful information about the pathophysiology of disease, and have implications that extend to all affected individuals. The purpose of this paper is to describe what is understood about the genetic variation that underlies obesity and T2D in African Americans and other individuals of more recent African descent and to highlight several examples that illustrate how ensuring adequate minority representation in genetic research improves its quality. For a variety of reasons a number of unique insights have been possible as a result of these efforts.

23579632|t|Association of rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.
23579632|a|Our objective was to evaluate the association of rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the world population. We carried out a survey of the literature about the effect of rs12255372 on genetic susceptibility to T2DM by consulting PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase from 2006 to 2012, and then performed a meta-analysis of all the studies in order to evaluate the association between rs12255372 and T2DM. A total of 33 articles including 42 studies (with 34,076 cases and 36,192 controls) were confirmed to be eligible and were included in the final meta-analysis: 6 studies conducted on Europeans, 14 on Caucasians, 17 on Asians, 2 on Africans, and 3 on Americans. Overall, the effect size was as follows: for the variant allele T (OR = 1.387, 95%CI = 1.351-1.424), for the TT genotype (OR = 1.933, 95%CI = 1.815-2.057), for the GT genotype (OR = 1.363, 95%CI = 1.315-1.413), for the dominant model (OR = 1.425, 95%CI = 1.344-1.510), and for the recessive model (OR = 1.659, 95%CI = 1.563-1.761). In summary, by pooling all available qualified data from genetic studies on rs12255372 and T2DM, we have confirmed that rs12255372 is significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in the global population.

23617586|t|Carriers of a novel frame-shift insertion in WNT16a possess elevated pancreatic expression of TCF7L2.
23617586|a|BACKGROUND: The discovery of TCF7L2 as a global type 2 diabetes (T2D) gene has sparked investigations to explore the clinical utility of its variants for guiding the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, interpreting the resulting associations into function still remains unclear. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates b-catenin and its binding with TCF7L2, which in turn is critical for the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This study examines the role of a novel frame-shift insertion discovered in a conserved region of WNT16a, and it is proposed that this mutation affects T2D susceptibility in conjunction with gene variants in TCF7L2. RESULTS: Our results predicted that the insertion would convert the upstream open reading frame in the Wnt16a mRNA to an alternative, in-frame translation initiation site, resulting in the prevention of nonsense-mediated decay, leading to a consequent stabilization of the mutated WNT16a message. To examine the role of Wnt16a in the Wnt signaling pathway, DNA and serum samples from 2,034 individuals (48% with T2D) from the Sikh Diabetes Study were used in this investigation. Prevalence of Wnt16a insertion did not differ among T2D cases (33%) and controls (32%). However, there was a 3.2 fold increase in Wnt16a mRNA levels in pancreatic tissues from the insertion carriers and a significant increase (70%, p < 0.0001) in luciferase activity in the constructs carrying the insertion. The expression of TCF7L2 mRNA in pancreas was also elevated (~23-fold) among the insertion carriers (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest synergistic effects of WNT16a insertion and the at-risk 'T' allele of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) for elevating the expression of TCF7L2 in human pancreas which may affect the regulation of downstream target genes involved in the development of T2D through Wnt/b-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling pathway. However, further studies would be needed to mechanistically link the two definitively.

23626757|t|Development of GMDR-GPU for gene-gene interaction analysis and its application to WTCCC GWAS data for type 2 diabetes.
23626757|a|Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many complex human traits, the susceptibility loci identified so far can explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Among other possible explanations, the lack of a comprehensive examination of gene-gene interaction (G*G) is often considered a source of the missing heritability. Previously, we reported a model-free Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) approach for detecting G*G in both dichotomous and quantitative phenotypes. However, the computational burden and less efficient implementation of the original programs make them impossible to use for GWAS. In this study, we developed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based GMDR program (named GWAS-GPU), which is able not only to analyze GWAS data but also to run much faster than the earlier version of the GMDR program. As a demonstration of the program, we used the GMDR-GPU software to analyze a publicly available GWAS dataset on type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Through an exhaustive search of pair-wise interactions and a selected search of three- to five-way interactions conditioned on significant pair-wise results, we identified 24 core SNPs in six genes (FTO: rs9939973, rs9940128, rs9922047, rs1121980, rs9939609, rs9930506; TSPAN8: rs1495377; TCF7L2: rs4074720, rs7901695, rs4506565, rs4132670, rs10787472, rs11196205, rs10885409, rs11196208; L3MBTL3: rs10485400, rs4897366; CELF4: rs2852373, rs608489; RUNX1: rs445984, rs1040328, rs990074, rs2223046, rs2834970) that appear to be important for T2D. Of these core SNPs, 11 in FTO, TSPAN8, and TCF7L2 have been reported to be associated with T2D, obesity, or both, providing an independent replication of previously reported SNPs. Importantly, we identified three new susceptibility genes; i.e., L3MBTL3, CELF4, and RUNX1, for T2D, a finding that warrants further investigation with independent samples.

23456907|t|Maternal genotype and gestational diabetes.
23456907|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis are associated with gestational diabetes (GDM). STUDY DESIGN: We genotyped 899 self-identified Caucasian women and 386 self-identified African-American women in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Studies cohorts for 38 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type II diabetes (T2DM) and/or glucose homeostasis in European populations. RESULTS: GDM was diagnosed in 56 of 899 (6.2%) Caucasian and 24 of 386 (6.2%) African-American women. Among Caucasian women, GDM was associated with carriage of TCF7L2 rs7901695, MTNR1B rs10830963 and GCKR rs780094 alleles that are associated with T2DM and fasting glucose in nonpregnant populations. Among African-American participants, we found an increased risk among TSPAN8 rs7961581 C allele homozygotes and reduced risk among carriers of the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele. CONCLUSION: We found several SNPs that are associated with GDM risk in the PIN cohorts. Maternal genotyping may identify women at risk for impaired gestational glucose tolerance.

23458876|t|ACE I/D and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms are significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in Arab ethnicity: a meta-analysis.
23458876|a|In this meta-analysis study, SNPs were investigated for their association with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in both Arab and Caucasian ethnicities. A total of 55 SNPs were analyzed, of which 11 fulfilled the selection criteria, and were used for analysis. It was found that TCF7L2 rs7903146 was significantly associated with a pooled OR of 1.155 (95%C.I.=1.059-1.259), p<0.0001 and I(2)=78.30% among the Arab population, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 1.45 (95%C.I.=1.386-1.516), p<0.0001 and I(2)=77.20%. KCNJ11 rs5219 was significantly associated in both the populations with a pooled OR of 1.176(1.092-1.268), p<0.0001 and I(2)=32.40% in Caucasians and a pooled OR of 1.28(1.111-1.475), p=0.001 among Arabs. The ACE I/D polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with a pooled OR of 1.992 (95%C.I.=1.774-2.236), p<0.0001 and I(2)=83.20% among the Arab population, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 1.078 (95%C.I.=0.993-1.17), p=0.073 and I(2)=0%. Similarly, MTHFR C677T polymorphism was also found to be significantly associated among Arabs with a pooled OR of 1.924 (95%C.I.=1.606-2.304), p<0.0001 and I(2)=27.20%, whereas among Caucasians, the pooled OR was 0.986 (95%C.I.=0.868-1.122), p=0.835 and I(2)=0%. Meanwhile PPARG-2 Pro12Ala, CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, HHEX rs7923837, CDKAL1 rs7754840, EXT2 rs1113132 and SLC30A8 rs13266634 were found to have no significant association with T2D among Arabs. In conclusion, it seems from this study that both Arabs and Caucasians have different SNPs associated with T2D. Moreover, this study sheds light on the profound necessity for further investigations addressing the question of the genetic components of T2D in Arabs.

23462794|t|Identification of CpG-SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes and differential DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets.
23462794|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To date, the molecular function of most of the reported type 2 diabetes-associated loci remains unknown. The introduction or removal of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides, which are possible sites of DNA methylation, has been suggested as a potential mechanism through which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect gene function via epigenetics. The aim of this study was to examine if any of 40 SNPs previously associated with type 2 diabetes introduce or remove a CpG site and if these CpG-SNPs are associated with differential DNA methylation in pancreatic islets of 84 human donors. METHODS: DNA methylation was analysed using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: We found that 19 of 40 (48%) type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs introduce or remove a CpG site. Successful DNA methylation data were generated for 16 of these 19 CpG-SNP loci, representing the candidate genes TCF7L2, KCNQ1, PPARG, HHEX, CDKN2A, SLC30A8, DUSP9, CDKAL1, ADCY5, SRR, WFS1, IRS1, DUSP8, HMGA2, TSPAN8 and CHCHD9. All analysed CpG-SNPs were associated with differential DNA methylation of the CpG-SNP site in human islets. Moreover, six CpG-SNPs, representing TCF7L2, KCNQ1, CDKN2A, ADCY5, WFS1 and HMGA2, were also associated with DNA methylation of surrounding CpG sites. Some of the type 2 diabetes CpG-SNP sites that exhibit differential DNA methylation were further associated with gene expression, alternative splicing events determined by splice index, and hormone secretion in the human islets. The 19 type 2 diabetes-associated CpG-SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium (r   > 0.8) with a total of 295 SNPs, including 91 CpG-SNPs. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the introduction or removal of a CpG site may be a molecular mechanism through which some of the type 2 diabetes SNPs affect gene function via differential DNA methylation and consequently contributes to the phenotype of the disease.

23492873|t|Recommendations from the EGAPP Working Group: does genomic profiling to assess type 2 diabetes risk improve health outcomes?
23492873|a|SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS: The Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) Working Group (EWG) found insufficient evidence to recommend testing for predictive variants in 28 variants (listed in Table 1) to assess risk for type 2 diabetes in the general population, on the basis of studies in populations of northern European descent. The EWG found that the magnitude of net health benefit from the use of any of these tests alone or in combination is close to zero. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.The EWG found insufficient evidence to recommend testing for the TCF7L2 gene to assess risk for type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. The EWG found that the magnitude of net health benefit from the use of this test is close to zero. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence supports improved clinical outcomes.On the basis of the available evidence for both the scenarios, the overall certainty of net health benefit is deemed "low." RATIONALE: It has been suggested that genomic profiling in the general population or in high-risk populations for type 2 diabetes might lead to management changes (e.g., earlier initiation or higher rates of medical interventions, or targeted recommendations for behavioral change) that improve type 2 diabetes outcomes or prevent type 2 diabetes. The EWG found no direct evidence to support this possibility; therefore, this review sought indirect evidence aimed at documenting the extent to which genomic profiling alters type 2 diabetes risk estimation, alone and in combination with traditional risk factors, and the extent to which risk classification improves health outcomes. ANALYTIC VALIDITY: Assay-related evidence on available genomic profiling tests was deemed inadequate. However, on the basis of existing technologies that have been or may be used, the analytic sensitivity and specificity of tests for individual gene variants might be at least satisfactory. CLINICAL VALIDITY: Twenty-eight candidate markers were evaluated in the general population. Evidence on clinical validity was rated inadequate for 24 of these associations (86%) and adequate for 4 (14%). Inadequate grades were based on limited evidence, poor replication, existence of possible biases, or combinations of these factors. Type 2 diabetes genomic profiling provided areas under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 55%-57%, with 4, 8, and 28 genes. Only TCF7L2 had convincing evidence of an association with type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 1.33-1.46).TCF7L2 was evaluated for high-risk populations, and the overall odds ratio was 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.22-2.27) for association with progression to type 2 diabetes. CLINICAL UTILITY: No studies were available to provide direct evidence on the balance of benefits and harms for genetic profiling for type 2 diabetes alone or in addition to traditional risk factors in the general population.Evidence for high-risk populations and TCF7L2 was inadequate on the basis of two identified studies. These studies found close to zero additional benefit with the addition of genomic markers to traditional risk factors (diet, body mass index, and glucose tolerance). CONTEXTUAL ISSUES: Prevention of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority. Improvements in the outcomes associated with genomic profiling could have important impacts. Traditional risk factors (e.g., body mass index, weight, fat mass, and exercise) have an advantage in clinical screening and risk assessment strategies because they measure the actual targets for therapy (e.g., fasting plasma glucose and medical interventions). To be useful in predicting disease risk, genomic testing should improve the predictive value of these traditional risk factors. Some issues important for clinical utility remain unknown, such as the level of risk that changes intervention, whether long-term disease outcomes will improve, how individuals being tested will understand/respond to test results and interact with the health-care system, and whether testing will motivate behavior change or amplify potential harms.

23492876|t|Use of genomic panels to determine risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the general population: a targeted evidence-based review.
23492876|a|This evidence review addresses whether type 2 diabetes genomic risk panels improve health outcomes (e.g., reduce rates of developing type 2 diabetes) in low- or high-risk adults; two clinical scenarios promulgated by commercial companies offering such testing. Evidence for the analytic validity of available genomic profiles was inadequate. Clinical validity ranged from inadequate to convincing for 30 variants identified on five type 2 diabetes genomic panels and by genome-wide association studies. Eight common variants were identified for general population use; evidence credibility based on published criteria was strong for two variants, moderate for two variants, and weak for four variants. TCF7L2 had the largest per-allele odds ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.33-1.46). Models combining the best four, best eight, and all 30 variants used summary effect sizes, reported genotype frequencies, and assumed independent effects. Areas under the curve were 0.547, 0.551, and 0.570, respectively. In high-risk populations, per-allele odds ratios for TCF7L2 alone were similar to those of the general population. TCF7L2, in combination with other variants, yielded minimal improvement in risk reclassification. Evidence on TCF7L2 clinical validity was adequate. Three studies addressed the clinical utility of intervention effectiveness, stratified by TCF7L2 genotype; none found significant interactions. Clinical utility evidence was inadequate. In addition to analytic validity and clinical utility knowledge gaps, additional gaps were identified regarding how to inform, produce, and evaluate models combining multiple variants.

23527042|t|Replication of type 2 diabetes candidate genes variations in three geographically unrelated Indian population groups.
23527042|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a syndrome of multiple metabolic disorders and is genetically heterogeneous. India comprises one of the largest global populations with highest number of reported type 2 diabetes cases. However, limited information about T2D associated loci is available for Indian populations. It is, therefore, pertinent to evaluate the previously associated candidates as well as identify novel genetic variations in Indian populations to understand the extent of genetic heterogeneity. We chose to do a cost effective high-throughput mass-array genotyping and studied the candidate gene variations associated with T2D in literature. In this case-control candidate genes association study, 91 SNPs from 55 candidate genes have been analyzed in three geographically independent population groups from India. We report the genetic variants in five candidate genes: TCF7L2, HHEX, ENPP1, IDE and FTO, are significantly associated (after Bonferroni correction, p<5.5E-04) with T2D susceptibility in combined population. Interestingly, SNP rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene passed the genome wide significance threshold (combined P value=2.05E-08) in the studied populations. We also observed the association of rs7903146 with blood glucose (fasting and postprandial) levels, supporting the role of TCF7L2 gene in blood glucose homeostasis. Further, we noted that the moderate risk provided by the independently associated loci in combined population with Odds Ratio (OR)<1.38 increased to OR=2.44, (95%CI=1.67-3.59) when the risk providing genotypes of TCF7L2, HHEX, ENPP1 and FTO genes were combined, suggesting the importance of gene-gene interactions evaluation in complex disorders like T2D.

23527206|t|The association between gene polymorphism of TCF7L2 and type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population: a meta-analysis.
23527206|a|In recent years, it has been widely accepted that transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in multiple ethnic groups, especially its single nucleotide polymorphisms of rs7903146C/T, rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C. However, the results previously obtained in Chinese Han population are often inconsistent. For clearing this issue, herein we performed meta-analysis based on the reports that can be found to assess the association. In the meta-analysis, Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated with random-effect model or fixed-effect model based on the heterogeneity analysis. The quality of included studies was evaluated by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The sensitivity analysis was used to confirm the reliability and stability of the meta-analysis. In total, 20 case-control studies with 9122 cases of T2DM and 8017 controls were included. Among these case-control studies, we selected 13 ones on rs7903146 C/T, 5 ones on rs12255372 G/T, 8 ones on rs290487 T/C. The results indicated that rs7903146C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM (T vs. C, OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.39-2.16). There was no evidence that rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C polymorphisms increased T2DM risk (T vs. G, OR=1.77, 95% CI=0.88-3.56; C vs. T, OR=1.08, 95% CI=0.93-1.25). Subgroup analysis of different regions proved the relationship between rs7903146C/T polymorphism and T2DM risk in both the northern and the southern China. The association of rs290487 with T2DM was affected by body mass index, whereas the association of rs7903146 and rs290487 with T2DM was influenced neither by age nor by sex. In conclusion, this study indicated that the rs7903146C/T polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene had a significant effect on T2DM risk in Chinese Han population, with rs12255372G/T and rs290487T/C polymorphisms showing no significant effect.

23536853|t|Association of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms in TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes in 9,619 Han Chinese population.
23536853|a|AIMS: We aimed to replicate the association of the rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China. METHODS: In all, 1,842 patients with T2DM and 7,777 normal glucose-tolerant controls underwent genotyping for the T2DM-associated variants rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T). W performed a meta-analysis of the association of the risk alleles of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) in TCF7L2 and T2DM in Han Chinese by combining previous studies with the present study. RESULTS: We found that T2DM was associated with the CC genotype (1.364, 1.137-1.636, p =0.001), the recessive model (1.457, 1.156-1.838, p =0.001) of rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and haplotype CC (1.116, 1.034-1.204, p =0.004) in Han Chinese. Moreover, our meta-analyses supported the association of the T allele (IVS3C/T) of rs7903146 (1.36, 1.24-1.48; p =6.404 10(-12)) and T2DM but not the C allele of rs290487 (IVS3C/T) (0.99, 0.85-1.15, p =0.890) in Han Chinese. We found no interactions between behavioral risk factors (smoking, alcohol drinking, and physical activity) and rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The CC genotype and the recessive model of the variant rs290487 (IVS3C/T) and CC haplotype of rs7903146 (IVS3C/T) and rs290487 (IVS3C/T) in TCF7L2 may be associated with T2DM in Han Chinese people in Henan province, China.

23558246|t|Impacts of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms on the susceptibility of hepatogenous diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients.
23558246|a|BACKGROUND: Hepatogenous diabetes (HD) occurs as a complication of cirrhosis. Whether genetic factors, rather than only liver damage, play roles in the development of HD is unknown. TCF7L2 gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes and also cancer risks. We aim to evaluate the impact of TCF7L2 gene on the susceptibility of HD and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Chinese Han population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 367 adult liver transplant candidates with liver cirrhosis were included. Fifteen tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from HapMap CHB database with a minor allele frequency of >0.2 and r(2) of >0.8. Another three SNPs were also chosen because of their close association with type 2 diabetes in East Asian. RESULTS: Patients with HD presented significantly poorer liver function, higher incidence of cirrhotic complications and higher insulin resistance compared with non-HD patients. Three SNPs were differentially distributed between HD patients and non-HD patients. In multivariate logistic analysis, TCF7L2 rs290487 and rs6585194 polymorphisms were independently associated with HD after adjustment of clinical factors. The TCF7L2 rs290487 C/C variant homozygote showed much higher insulin resistance and significantly increased HD risk comparing with T/T and T/C genotypes, while the genetic variant of rs6585194 was protectively against HD. Three SNPs (rs290481, rs290487 and rs290489) located near the 3' end of TCF7L2 gene were associated with HCC risk with marginal significance. Patients carrying G-C-A haplotype had a significantly higher HCC risk than those with A-T-G. CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 polymorphisms were associated with HD and maybe cancer risk as well. Further studies with large samples are needed to verify these results.

23577093|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with T2DM in the population of Hyderabad, India.
23577093|a|We attempt to evaluate the nature of association of TCF7L2 gene variants with T2DM, for the first time in the population of Hyderabad, which is considered to be diabetic capital of India. It is a case-control study of the three SNPs of TCF7L2, rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11196205, genotyped on Sequenom Massarray platform, in a sample of 758 patients and 621 controls. The risk allele frequency of the three SNPs was found to be significantly higher in the T2DM cases than controls, implicating susceptibility for diabetes (p<0.01). The greatest risk of developing the disease was conferred by rs7903146. Further, the logistic regression of genotypes of each SNP under log additive model, and the haplotypes constituted by at least one of the three risk alleles also show significantly greater risk of developing T2DM when compared to the wild type haplotype. Further, BMI and WHR emerge as significant covariates with confounding effects. The strong association of the TCF7L2 SNPs with T2DM is consistent with the findings among other Indian and Non-Indian populations, suggesting universal phenomena of its association across ethnic groups globally, both within and outside the Indian subcontinent, albeit the functional relevance of these SNPs needs yet to be established.

23577239|t|Genetics of obesity and type 2 diabetes in African Americans.
23577239|a|Obesity and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the impact of these conditions may be worse on historically underserved minorities, particularly African Americans. Genetic ancestry and differences in physiology are unlikely to be the sole or primary determinants of these disparities. In addition, research in this area has the ethically problematic possibility of conflating race with biology. Despite these important considerations and the challenges of conducting this work, population-based approaches for investigating the etiology of obesity and T2D may yield useful information about the pathophysiology of disease, and have implications that extend to all affected individuals. The purpose of this paper is to describe what is understood about the genetic variation that underlies obesity and T2D in African Americans and other individuals of more recent African descent and to highlight several examples that illustrate how ensuring adequate minority representation in genetic research improves its quality. For a variety of reasons a number of unique insights have been possible as a result of these efforts.

23579632|t|Association of rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.
23579632|a|Our objective was to evaluate the association of rs12255372 in the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the world population. We carried out a survey of the literature about the effect of rs12255372 on genetic susceptibility to T2DM by consulting PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase from 2006 to 2012, and then performed a meta-analysis of all the studies in order to evaluate the association between rs12255372 and T2DM. A total of 33 articles including 42 studies (with 34,076 cases and 36,192 controls) were confirmed to be eligible and were included in the final meta-analysis: 6 studies conducted on Europeans, 14 on Caucasians, 17 on Asians, 2 on Africans, and 3 on Americans. Overall, the effect size was as follows: for the variant allele T (OR = 1.387, 95%CI = 1.351-1.424), for the TT genotype (OR = 1.933, 95%CI = 1.815-2.057), for the GT genotype (OR = 1.363, 95%CI = 1.315-1.413), for the dominant model (OR = 1.425, 95%CI = 1.344-1.510), and for the recessive model (OR = 1.659, 95%CI = 1.563-1.761). In summary, by pooling all available qualified data from genetic studies on rs12255372 and T2DM, we have confirmed that rs12255372 is significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in the global population.

23617586|t|Carriers of a novel frame-shift insertion in WNT16a possess elevated pancreatic expression of TCF7L2.
23617586|a|BACKGROUND: The discovery of TCF7L2 as a global type 2 diabetes (T2D) gene has sparked investigations to explore the clinical utility of its variants for guiding the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, interpreting the resulting associations into function still remains unclear. Canonical Wnt signaling regulates b-catenin and its binding with TCF7L2, which in turn is critical for the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This study examines the role of a novel frame-shift insertion discovered in a conserved region of WNT16a, and it is proposed that this mutation affects T2D susceptibility in conjunction with gene variants in TCF7L2. RESULTS: Our results predicted that the insertion would convert the upstream open reading frame in the Wnt16a mRNA to an alternative, in-frame translation initiation site, resulting in the prevention of nonsense-mediated decay, leading to a consequent stabilization of the mutated WNT16a message. To examine the role of Wnt16a in the Wnt signaling pathway, DNA and serum samples from 2,034 individuals (48% with T2D) from the Sikh Diabetes Study were used in this investigation. Prevalence of Wnt16a insertion did not differ among T2D cases (33%) and controls (32%). However, there was a 3.2 fold increase in Wnt16a mRNA levels in pancreatic tissues from the insertion carriers and a significant increase (70%, p < 0.0001) in luciferase activity in the constructs carrying the insertion. The expression of TCF7L2 mRNA in pancreas was also elevated (~23-fold) among the insertion carriers (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest synergistic effects of WNT16a insertion and the at-risk 'T' allele of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) for elevating the expression of TCF7L2 in human pancreas which may affect the regulation of downstream target genes involved in the development of T2D through Wnt/b-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling pathway. However, further studies would be needed to mechanistically link the two definitively.

23626757|t|Development of GMDR-GPU for gene-gene interaction analysis and its application to WTCCC GWAS data for type 2 diabetes.
23626757|a|Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many complex human traits, the susceptibility loci identified so far can explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Among other possible explanations, the lack of a comprehensive examination of gene-gene interaction (G*G) is often considered a source of the missing heritability. Previously, we reported a model-free Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) approach for detecting G*G in both dichotomous and quantitative phenotypes. However, the computational burden and less efficient implementation of the original programs make them impossible to use for GWAS. In this study, we developed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based GMDR program (named GWAS-GPU), which is able not only to analyze GWAS data but also to run much faster than the earlier version of the GMDR program. As a demonstration of the program, we used the GMDR-GPU software to analyze a publicly available GWAS dataset on type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Through an exhaustive search of pair-wise interactions and a selected search of three- to five-way interactions conditioned on significant pair-wise results, we identified 24 core SNPs in six genes (FTO: rs9939973, rs9940128, rs9922047, rs1121980, rs9939609, rs9930506; TSPAN8: rs1495377; TCF7L2: rs4074720, rs7901695, rs4506565, rs4132670, rs10787472, rs11196205, rs10885409, rs11196208; L3MBTL3: rs10485400, rs4897366; CELF4: rs2852373, rs608489; RUNX1: rs445984, rs1040328, rs990074, rs2223046, rs2834970) that appear to be important for T2D. Of these core SNPs, 11 in FTO, TSPAN8, and TCF7L2 have been reported to be associated with T2D, obesity, or both, providing an independent replication of previously reported SNPs. Importantly, we identified three new susceptibility genes; i.e., L3MBTL3, CELF4, and RUNX1, for T2D, a finding that warrants further investigation with independent samples.

23670970|t|Genetic modifiers of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.
23670970|a|Diabetes is a common age-dependent complication of cystic fibrosis (CF) that is strongly influenced by modifier genes. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 3,059 individuals with CF (644 with CF-related diabetes [CFRD]) and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and 5' to the SLC26A9 gene that associated with CFRD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38; P = 3.6   10(-8)). Replication was demonstrated in 694 individuals (124 with CFRD) (HR, 1.47; P = 0.007), with combined analysis significant at P = 9.8   10(-10). SLC26A9 is an epithelial chloride/bicarbonate channel that can interact with the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the protein mutated in CF. We also hypothesized that common SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes also might affect risk for CFRD. A previous association of CFRD with SNPs in TCF7L2 was replicated in this study (P = 0.004; combined analysis P = 3.8   10(-6)), and type 2 diabetes SNPs at or near CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 were associated with CFRD (P < 0.004). These five loci accounted for 8.3% of the phenotypic variance in CFRD onset and had a combined population-attributable risk of 68%. Diabetes is a highly prevalent complication of CF, for which susceptibility is determined in part by variants at SLC26A9 (which mediates processes proximate to the CF disease-causing gene) and at four susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes in the general population.

23690305|t|Genetic variants and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.
23690305|a|BACKGROUND: Several studies have examined associations between genetic variants and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, inferences from these studies were often hindered by limited statistical power and conflicting results. We aimed to systematically review and quantitatively summarize the association of commonly studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with GDM risk and to identify important gaps that remain for consideration in future studies. METHODS: Genetic association studies of GDM published through 1 October 2012 were searched using the HuGE Navigator and PubMed databases. A SNP was included if the SNP-GDM associations were assessed in three or more independent studies. Two reviewers independently evaluated the eligibility for inclusion and extracted the data. The allele-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models accounting for heterogeneity. RESULTS: Overall, 29 eligible articles capturing associations of 12 SNPs from 10 genes were included for the systematic review. The minor alleles of rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs12255372 (TCF7L2), rs1799884 (-30G/A, GCK), rs5219 (E23K, KCNJ11), rs7754840 (CDKAL1), rs4402960 (IGF2BP2), rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153 (MTNR1B) and rs1801278 (Gly972Arg, IRS1) were significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM. Among them, genetic variants in TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.44 (1.29-1.60, P < 0.001) per T allele of rs7903146 and 1.46 (1.15-1.84, P = 0.002) per T allele of rs12255372. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found significant associations of GDM risk with nine SNPs in seven genes, most of which have been related to the regulation of insulin secretion.

23710470|t|Animal models of GWAS-identified type 2 diabetes genes.
23710470|a|More than 65 loci, encoding up to 500 different genes, have been implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as conferring an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whilst mouse models have in the past been central to understanding the mechanisms through which more penetrant risk genes for T2D, for example, those responsible for neonatal or maturity-onset diabetes of the young, only a few of those identified by GWAS, notably TCF7L2 and ZnT8/SLC30A8, have to date been examined in mouse models. We discuss here the animal models available for the latter genes and provide perspectives for future, higher throughput approaches towards efficiently mining the information provided by human genetics.

23737909|t|Ileal interposition surgery-induced improvement of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in Goto-Kakizaki rats by upregulation of TCF7L2 expression.
23737909|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ileal interposition (IT) on glucose and insulin resistance (IR) in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), and the role of T-cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), formerly known as TCF4, in the downregulation of hyperglycemia following IT. Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats subjected to IT surgery (GK-IT group), GK rats subjected to sham surgery (GK-Sham group) and Wistar (WS) rats subjected to sham surgery (WS-Sham group) were investigated in this study. Fasting plasma glucose, body weight, food intake per 1 kg body weight, insulin and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured pre- and post-surgery. The rats were euthanized 28 days post-surgery and the pancreas of each rat was dissected. The expression levels of TCF7L2 mRNA and protein were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Our results revealed that IT improved both fasting plasma glucose levels and IR in GK rats by upregulating the expression of the TCF7L2 protein. IT provides a valuable therapeutic option for patients with T2DM. Upregulation of TCF7L2 protein expression may be a possible mechanism underlying the improvement of T2DM following IT.

23761423|t|Association of risk variants for type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia with gestational diabetes.
23761423|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of risk variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperglycemia with gestational diabetes (GDM). DESIGN AND METHODS: Five hundred and thirty-three Finnish women who were diagnosed with GDM and 407 controls with normal glucose tolerance during the pregnancy were genotyped for 69 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which have been previously verified as susceptibility risk variants for T2D and hyperglycemia. All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test at the follow-up study after the index pregnancy. RESULTS: Risk variants rs10830963 and rs1387153 of MTNR1B were significantly associated with GDM (odds ratio (OR)=1.62 (95% CI 1.34-1.96), P=4.5   10       and 1.38 (1.14-1.66), P=7.6   10       respectively). Both SNPs of MTNR1B were also significantly associated with elevated fasting glucose level and reduced insulin secretion at follow-up. Additionally, risk variants rs9939609 of FTO, rs2796441 of TLE1, rs560887 of G6PC2, rs780094 of GCKR, rs7903146 of TCF7L2 and rs11708067 of ADCY5 showed nominally significant associations with GDM (OR range from 1.25 to 1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that GDM and T2D share a similar genetic background. Our findings also provide further evidence that risk variants of MTNR1B are associated with GDM by increasing fasting plasma glucose and decreasing insulin secretion.

23804578|t|Centenarians as super-controls to assess the biological relevance of genetic risk factors for common age-related diseases: a proof of principle on type 2 diabetes.
23804578|a|Genetic association studies of age-related, chronic human diseases often suffer from a lack of power to detect modest effects. Here we propose an alternative approach of including healthy centenarians as a more homogeneous and extreme control group. As a proof of principle we focused on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assessed /genotypic associations of 31 SNPs associated with T2D, diabetes complications and metabolic diseases and SNPs of genes relevant for telomere stability and age-related diseases. We hypothesized that the frequencies of risk variants are inversely correlated with decreasing health and longevity. We performed association analyses comparing diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls followed by association analyses with extreme phenotypic groups (T2D patients with complications and centenarians). Results drew attention to rs7903146 (TCF7L2 gene) that showed a constant increase in the frequencies of risk genotype (TT) from centenarians to diabetic patients who developed macro-complications and the strongest genotypic association was detected when diabetic patients were compared to centenarians (p_value = 9.066*10      ). We conclude that robust and biologically relevant associations can be obtained when extreme phenotypes, even with a small sample size, are compared.

23825961|t|A six months exercise intervention influences the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in human adipose tissue.
23825961|a|Epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in gene regulation and the development of different diseases. The epigenome differs between cell types and has until now only been characterized for a few human tissues. Environmental factors potentially alter the epigenome. Here we describe the genome-wide pattern of DNA methylation in human adipose tissue from 23 healthy men, with a previous low level of physical activity, before and after a six months exercise intervention. We also investigate the differences in adipose tissue DNA methylation between 31 individuals with or without a family history of type 2 diabetes. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, an array containing 485,577 probes covering 99% RefSeq genes. Global DNA methylation changed and 17,975 individual CpG sites in 7,663 unique genes showed altered levels of DNA methylation after the exercise intervention (q<0.05). Differential mRNA expression was present in 1/3 of gene regions with altered DNA methylation, including RALBP1, HDAC4 and NCOR2 (q<0.05). Using a luciferase assay, we could show that increased DNA methylation in vitro of the RALBP1 promoter suppressed the transcriptional activity (p=0.03). Moreover, 18 obesity and 21 type 2 diabetes candidate genes had CpG sites with differences in adipose tissue DNA methylation in response to exercise (q<0.05), including TCF7L2 (6 CpG sites) and KCNQ1 (10 CpG sites). A simultaneous change in mRNA expression was seen for 6 of those genes. To understand if genes that exhibit differential DNA methylation and mRNA expression in human adipose tissue in vivo affect adipocyte metabolism, we silenced Hdac4 and Ncor2 respectively in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which resulted in increased lipogenesis both in the basal and insulin stimulated state. In conclusion, exercise induces genome-wide changes in DNA methylation in human adipose tissue, potentially affecting adipocyte metabolism.

23839539|t|Expression profiling of type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in the pancreatic islets, adipose tissue and liver of obese mice.
23839539|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by impaired beta cell function and insulin resistance. T2D susceptibility genes identified by Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are likely to have roles in both impaired insulin secretion from the beta cell as well as insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to use gene expression profiling to assess the effect of the diabetic milieu on the expression of genes involved in both insulin secretion and insulin resistance.We measured the expression of 43 T2D susceptibility genes in the islets, adipose and liver of leptin-deficient Ob/Ob mice compared with Ob/+ littermates. The same panel of genes were also profiled in cultured rodent adipocytes, hepatocytes and beta cells in response to high glucose conditions, to distinguish expression effects due to elevated glycemia from those on the causal pathway to diabetes or induced by other factors in the diabetic microenviroment.We found widespread deregulation of these genes in tissues from Ob/Ob mice, with differential regulation of 23 genes in adipose, 18 genes in liver and one gene (Tcf7l2) in islets of diabetic animals (Ob/Ob) compared to control (Ob/+) animals. However, these expression changes were in most cases not noted in glucose-treated adipocyte, hepatocyte or beta cell lines, indicating that they may not be an effect of hyperglycemia alone.This study indicates that expression changes are apparent with diabetes in both the insulin producing beta cells, but also in peripheral tissues involved in insulin resistance. This suggests that incidence or progression of diabetic phenotypes in a mouse model of diabetes is driven by both secretory and peripheral defects.

23855352|t|Association of the rs7903146 polymorphism in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene with gestational diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.
23855352|a|A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism rs7903146 (IVS3C   >   T) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all case-control or cohort design studies of the above-mentioned associations. The fixed or random effect pooled measure was selected on the basis of homogeneity test among studies. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the I(2). Meta-regression was used to explore the potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated using Egger's linear regression test. A total of 10 studies including 3404 cases and 6473 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, after excluding articles that deviated from HWE in controls, and further the key contributors to between-study heterogeneity, significant associations between TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic polymorphism and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus were observed in the dominant (OR 1.653, 95% CI 1.416-1.930) and codominant (OR 1.525, 95% CI 1.350-1.723) models. The meta-analysis suggests that TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic polymorphism was associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.

23942586|t|Mediterranean diet reduces the adverse effect of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism on cardiovascular risk factors and stroke incidence: a randomized controlled trial in a high-cardiovascular-risk population.
23942586|a|OBJECTIVE: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, but controversially with plasma lipids and cardiovascular disease. Interactions of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on these associations are unknown. We investigated whether the TCF7L2-rs7903146 (C>T) polymorphism associations with type 2 diabetes, glucose, lipids, and cardiovascular disease incidence were modulated by MedDiet. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized trial (two MedDiet intervention groups and a control group) with 7,018 participants in the PREvenci  n con DIetaMEDiterr  nea study was undertaken and major cardiovascular events assessed. Data were analyzed at baseline and after a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events. RESULTS: The TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism was associated with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.87 [95% CI 1.62-2.17] for TT compared with CC). MedDiet interacted significantly with rs7903146 on fasting glucose at baseline (P interaction = 0.004). When adherence to the MedDiet was low, TT had higher fasting glucose concentrations (132.3    3.5 mg/dL) than CC+CT (127.3    3.2 mg/dL) individuals (P = 0.001). Nevertheless, when adherence was high, this increase was not observed (P = 0.605). This modulation was also detected for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (P interaction < 0.05 for all). Likewise, in the randomized trial, TT subjects had a higher stroke incidence in the control group (adjusted HR 2.91 [95% CI 1.36-6.19]; P = 0.006 compared with CC), whereas dietary intervention with MedDiet reduced stroke incidence in TT homozygotes (adjusted HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.49-1.87]; P = 0.892 for TT compared with CC). CONCLUSIONS: Our novel results suggest that MedDiet may not only reduce increased fasting glucose and lipids in TT individuals, but also stroke incidence.

23942764|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The relationship between insulin secretion and the incidence of hypertension has not been well characterised. We hypothesised that both a parental history of diabetes and TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, which increases susceptibility to diabetes because of impaired beta cell function, are associated with incident hypertension. In a separate cohort, we assessed whether low insulin secretion is related to incident hypertension. METHODS: Nine year incident hypertension was studied in 2,391 normotensive participants from the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) cohort. The relationship between insulin secretion and 3 year incident hypertension was investigated in 1,047 non-diabetic, normotensive individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease (RISC) cohort. Insulin secretion during OGTT was expressed in relation to the degree of insulin resistance, as assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. RESULTS: In the DESIR cohort, a parental history of diabetes and the TCF7L2 at-risk variant were both associated with hypertension incidence at year 9, independently of waist circumference, BP, fasting glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR at inclusion (p = 0.02 for parental history, p = 0.006 for TCF7L2). In the RISC cohort, a lower insulin secretion rate during the OGTT at baseline was associated with both higher BP and a greater risk of hypertension at year 3. This inverse correlation between the insulin secretion rate and incident hypertension persisted after controlling for baseline insulin resistance, glycaemia and BP (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Parental history of diabetes, TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and a reduced insulin secretion rate were consistently associated with incident hypertension. A low insulin secretion rate might be a new risk factor for incident hypertension, beyond insulin resistance.

23961321|t|Genetics of type 2 diabetes.
23961321|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the result of interaction between environmental factors and a strong hereditary component. We review the heritability of T2D as well as the history of genetic and genomic research in this area. Very few T2D risk genes were identified using candidate gene and linkage-based studies, but the advent of genome-wide association studies has led to the identification of multiple genes, including several that were not previously known to play any role in T2D. Highly replicated genes, for example TCF7L2, KCNQ1 and KCNJ11, are discussed in greater detail. Taken together, the genetic loci discovered to date explain only a small proportion of the observed heritability. We discuss possible explanations for this "missing heritability", including the role of rare variants, gene-environment interactions and epigenetics. The clinical utility of current findings and avenues of future research are also discussed.

24002895|t|Rs290487 of TCF7L2 gene is not associated with type 2 diabetes in Chinese Han population: a case control study and meta-analysis.
24002895|a|AIMS: rs290487 in TCF7L2 was originally identified to be associated with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan Chinese population. However, discrepancies were noted in subsequent replicated studies. So the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of rs290487 in TCF7L2 on genetic susceptibility of type 2 diabetes in a large sample of Chinese -population. RESULTS: In meta analysis of 9 studies with 9 422 cases and 8 585 control subjects, no association was found between rs290487 and type 2 diabetes in China (OR=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.17, p=0.19). In case control study, rs290487 was genotyped in 5 151 diabetic patients and 4 650 non-diabetic controls. After adjusting for sex, age and BMI, and using an additive genetic model, logistic regression analysis revealed no association between rs290487 and type 2 diabetes (OR=1.015, 95%CI 0.949-1.087, p=0.662). No association was found between rs290487 and type 2 diabetes in northern and southern Chinese population separately. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have found no association between rs290487 and type 2 diabetes in Chinese population. This SNP is unlikely an influential genetic variant with type 2 diabetes in Chinese population.

24035868|t|Malondialdehyde regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in murine islets via TCF7L2-dependent Wnt signaling pathway.
24035868|a|Evidence showed strong relations between malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and different pathological stages of diabetes. Here, an explicit system with freshly isolated islets and precisely controlled MDA gradient was employed to investigate the physiological effect of MDA on GSIS. Promoter analysis, pathway mapping, Q-PCR profiling, and siRNA verification were performed to clarify the intracellular signaling pathways. MDA at a moderately high level (5 and 10 M) promoted GSIS and accompanied with ATP/ADP ratio, cytosolic Ca(2+) level, and key regulators (GK, GLUT2, PDX1, and UCP2) changes in islets. Both upstream (PI3K and p-AKT) and downstream (TCF7L2 and TCF7) factors of Wnt pathway showed greatest changes. Knockdown of TCF7L2 blocked the MDA-induced GSIS elevation. These results indicated that MDA acted as a signaling messenger and regulated islet GSIS mainly through Wnt pathway. Therefore, the elevated MDA level and up-regulated Wnt signaling pathway could be an etiological factor in the development of hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes.

24044104|t|Nor-1, a novel incretin-responsive regulator of insulin genes and insulin secretion.
24044104|a|B-cell failure at the onset of type 2 diabetes is caused by a decline in b-cell function in the postprandial state and loss of pancreatic b-cell mass. Recently, we showed an association between increased insulin secretion and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP rs12686676, in the NR4A3 gene locus encoding the nuclear receptor Nor-1. Nor-1 is expressed in b-cells, however, not much is known about its function with regard to insulin gene expression and insulin secretion. Nor-1 is induced in a glucose-/incretin-dependent manner via the PKA pathway and directly induces insulin gene expression. Additionally, it stimulates insulin secretion possibly via regulation of potentially important genes in insulin exocytosis. Moreover, we show that the minor allele of NR4A3 SNP rs12686676 fully rescues incretin resistance provoked by a well-described polymorphism in TCF7L2. Thus, Nor-1 represents a promising new target for pharmacological intervention to fight diabetes.

24059590|t|The TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T) allele is associated with type 2 diabetes in urban Ghana: a hospital-based case-control study.
24059590|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, and genetic predisposition is likely involved in that. Yet, genetic variants known to confer increased susceptibility among Caucasians are far from being established in African populations. In Ghanaian adults, we examined associations of several of these polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study on type 2 diabetes (and hypertension) was conducted in Kumasi, Ghana. TCF7L2 rs7903146, KCNJ11 rs5219, PPARy rs1801282 and CAPN10 rs3842570, rs3792267, and rs5030952 were typed and associations with type 2 diabetes and phenotypic traits examined. RESULTS: 675 patients with type 2 diabetes and 377 controls were compared. The minor allele frequency of the TCF7L2 (T) allele was 0.33. In the multivariate model, this allele increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 39% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.81; p   =   0.014). The minor alleles KCNJ11 (G) and PPARy (G) were practically absent (each, 0.001). Minor allele frequencies of CAPN10 were for -43 (A) 0.11 and for -63 (C) 0.46. These variants showed no significant associations with type 2 diabetes. Two CAPN10 haplotypes tended to protect against type 2 diabetes: 211 (aOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.03-1.92; p   =   0.31) and 221 (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; p   =   0.13). CONCLUSIONS: In urban Ghana, the frequency of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T) allele is comparable to the one in Caucasians; the association with type 2 diabetes is slightly weaker. The risk allele KCNJ11 (G) and the protective allele PPARy (G) are virtually absent. The potential influence of comparatively rare CAPN10 haplotypes on type 2 diabetes risk in this population requires further evaluation. Large-scale genetic studies among native Africans aiming at fine-mapping the candidate genes are needed to identify the actual factors involved in their increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

24062323|t|Co-occurrence of risk alleles in or near genes modulating insulin secretion predisposes obese youth to prediabetes.
24062323|a|OBJECTIVE: Paralleling the rise of pediatric obesity, the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing among youth. In this study, we asked whether the co-occurrence of risk alleles in or near five genes modulating insulin secretion (TCF7L2 rs7903146, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, CDKAL1 rs7754840, HHEX rs1111875, and HNF1A rs1169288) is associated with a higher risk of IGT/T2D in obese children and adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 714 obese subjects (290 boys and 424 girls; mean age 13.6    3.1 years; mean z score BMI 2.2    0.4) and evaluated the insulin secretion by using the oral minimal model and, in a subgroup of 37 subjects, the hyperglycemic clamp. Also, 203 subjects were followed up for a mean of 2.1 years. RESULTS: We observed that the increase of risk alleles was associated with a progressive worsening of insulin secretion (P < 0.001) mainly due to an impairment of the dynamic phase of insulin secretion (P = 0.004); the higher the number of the risk alleles, the higher the chance of progression from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to IGT/T2D (P = 0.022). Also, for those who were IGT at baseline, a higher risk score was associated with a lower odds to revert to NGT (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Obese children and adolescents developing IGT/T2D have a higher genetic predisposition than those who do not show these diseases, and this predisposition is mainly related to gene variants modulating the early phase of insulin secretion. Although these data are very interesting, they need to be replicated in other cohorts.

24063630|t|Genetic variants associated with fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in an ethnically diverse population: results from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study.
24063630|a|BACKGROUND: Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within European populations have implicated common genetic variants associated with insulin and glucose concentrations. In contrast, few studies have been conducted within minority groups, which carry the highest burden of impaired glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes in the U.S. METHODS: As part of the 'Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, we investigated the association of up to 10 GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genetic regions with glucose or insulin concentrations in up to 36,579 non-diabetic subjects including 23,323 European Americans (EA) and 7,526 African Americans (AA), 3,140 Hispanics, 1,779 American Indians (AI), and 811 Asians. We estimated the association between each SNP and fasting glucose or log-transformed fasting insulin, followed by meta-analysis to combine results across PAGE sites. RESULTS: Overall, our results show that 9/9 GWAS SNPs are associated with glucose in EA (p = 0.04 to 9 * 10-15), versus 3/9 in AA (p= 0.03 to 6 * 10-5), 3/4 SNPs in Hispanics, 2/4 SNPs in AI, and 1/2 SNPs in Asians. For insulin we observed a significant association with rs780094/GCKR in EA, Hispanics and AI only. CONCLUSIONS: Generalization of results across multiple racial/ethnic groups helps confirm the relevance of some of these loci for glucose and insulin metabolism. Lack of association in non-EA groups may be due to insufficient power, or to unique patterns of linkage disequilibrium.

24128935|t|Impact of TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms on hydrochlorothiazide-induced diabetes.
24128935|a|OBJECTIVE: Thiazide diuretics have been associated with increased risk for new onset diabetes (NOD), but pharmacogenetic markers of thiazide-induced NOD are not well studied. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) represent the strongest and most reproducible genetic associations with diabetes. We investigated the association of tag SNPs in TCF7L2 with thiazide-induced NOD. METHODS: We identified cases that developed NOD and age, sex, and race/ethnicity-matched controls from the INternational VErapamil SR-Trandolapril STudy (INVEST). INVEST compared cardiovascular outcomes between two antihypertensive treatment strategies in ethnically diverse patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease. We genotyped 101 TCF7L2 tag SNPs and used logistic regression to test for pharmacogenetic (SNP*hydrochlorothiazide treatment) interactions. Permuted interaction P values were corrected with the PACT test and adjusted for diabetes-related variables. RESULTS: In INVEST whites, we observed three TCF7L2 SNPs with significant SNP*treatment interactions for NOD. The strongest pharmacogenetic interaction was observed for rs7917983 [synergy index 3.37 (95% CI 1.72-6.59), P=5.0*10, PACT=0.03], which was associated with increased NOD risk in hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients [odds ratio 1.53 (1.04-2.25), P=0.03] and decreased NOD risk in non hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients [odds ratio 0.48 (0.27-0.86), P=0.02]. The TCF7L2 SNP rs4506565, previously associated with diabetes, showed a similar, significant pharmacogenetic association. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hydrochlorothiazide treatment is an environmental risk factor that increases diabetes risk beyond that attributed to TCF7L2 variation in white, hypertensive patients. Further study and replication of our results is needed to confirm pharmacogenetic influences of TCF7L2 SNPs on thiazide-induced NOD.

24140094|t|Anti-diabetic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 on pancreatic beta-cells.
24140094|a|Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone, is released from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrients. GLP-1 lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. In addition, GLP-1 slows gastric emptying, suppresses appetite, reduces plasma glucagon, and stimulates glucose disposal, which are beneficial for glucose homeostasis. Therefore, incretin-based therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an enzyme which inactivates GLP-1, have been developed for treatment of diabetes. This review outlines our knowledge of the actions of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and biosynthesis, beta-cell proliferation and regeneration, and protection against beta-cell damage, as well as the involvement of recently discovered signaling pathways of GLP-1 action, mainly focusing on pancreatic beta-cells.

24145053|t|A replication study of 19 GWAS-validated type 2 diabetes at-risk variants in the Lebanese population.
24145053|a|AIM: Recent genome-wide association scans (GWAS) and replication studies have expanded the list of validated type 2 diabetes (T2DM) susceptibility loci. We replicated T2DM association of 19 SNPs from 15 candidate loci in Lebanese Arabs. METHODS: Case-control association study, comprising 995 T2DM patients and 1076 control participants. We genotyped by the allelic discrimination method 19 SNPs in/near ADAM30, NOTCH2, THADA, TMEFF2, COL8A1, ADAMTS9-AS2, WFS1, JAZF1, SLC30A8, KCNQ1, LOC387761, ALX4, TSPAN8, FTO, and HNF1. RESULTS: Allele frequencies of the tested SNPs were comparable with those of Caucasians. COL8A1 rs792837 (P=2.9   10(-9)), KCNQ1 rs2237892 (P=1.8   10(-18)) and rs2237895 (P=0.002), ALX4 rs729287 (Pc=7.5   10(-5)), and HNF1 rs4430796 (P=0.003) were significantly associated with T2DM, with similar effect sizes to those of Europeans. While FTO rs8050136 and rs17817449, ADAMTS9 rs4607103, and WFS1 rs10010131 were initially associated with T2DM, this was lost upon multiple testing correction. The remaining variants were not associated with T2DM, possibly resulting from insufficient power to detect smaller allele effects. CONCLUSION: In addition to previous findings on the association of IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, TCF7L2 variants with T2DM among Lebanese, here we extend these by validating the association of five additional loci with T2DM in Lebanese Arabs.

24157263|t|Polymorphisms of transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in Tunisian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
24157263|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects women in their child-bearing age, and is often associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Given the overlap between PCOS and T2DM, we investigated the association of transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, and rs12255372 with the susceptibility to PCOS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study subjects comprised 119 Tunisian women with PCOS (mean age 29.8  4.7years), and 150 control women (mean age 30.6  5.9years). TCF7L2 genotyping was done by the allelic discrimination/real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of rs4506565 (P=0.61), rs7903146 (P=0.68), rs12243326 (P=0.56), and rs12255372 (P=0.60) were comparable between PCOS cases and control subjects. As the four tested TCF7L2 variants were in linkage disequilibrium, 4-locus (rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, rs12255372) haplotype analysis demonstrated that haplotype 2111 was initially negatively associated with PCOS [P=0.035; OR (95% CI)=0.13 (0.02-0.85)], which was later lost upon correcting for multiple comparisons [Pc=0.248]. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that there is weak or no contribution of TCF7L2 gene polymorphism to PCOS in Tunisian women. Further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm this observation.

24205231|t|Plasma metabolomics reveal alterations of sphingo- and glycerophospholipid levels in non-diabetic carriers of the transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphism rs7903146.
24205231|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been shown to display a powerful association with type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate metabolic alterations in carriers of a common TCF7L2 risk variant. METHODS: Seventeen non-diabetic subjects carrying the T risk allele at the rs7903146 TCF7L2 locus and 24 subjects carrying no risk allele were submitted to intravenous glucose tolerance test and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Plasma samples were analysed for concentrations of 163 metabolites through targeted mass spectrometry. RESULTS: TCF7L2 risk allele carriers had a reduced first-phase insulin response and normal insulin sensitivity. Under fasting conditions, carriers of TCF7L2 rs7903146 exhibited a non-significant increase of plasma sphingomyelins (SMs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) species. A significant genotype effect was detected in response to challenge tests in 6 SMs (C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C24:0, C24:1), 5 hydroxy-SMs (C14:1, C16:1, C22:1, C22:2, C24:1), 4 lysoPCs (C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0), 3 diacyl-PCs (C28:1, C36:6, C40:4) and 4 long-chain acyl-alkyl-PCs (C40:2, C40:5, C44:5, C44:6). DISCUSSION: Plasma metabolomic profiling identified alterations of phospholipid metabolism in response to challenge tests in subjects with TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype. This may reflect a genotype-mediated link to early metabolic abnormalities prior to the development of disturbed glucose tolerance.

24214952|t|Association of variant rs7903146 (C/T) single nucleotide polymorphism of TCF7L2 gene with impairment in wound healing among north Indian type 2 diabetes population: a case-control study.
24214952|a|The variants of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its several secondary complications. Here, we aimed to examine the possible role of one of the common variant of this gene, rs7903146 (C/T), with impairment of wound healing in cases with T2DM. A total of 750 individuals, including 322 patients with T2DM and 120 patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and 308 controls, were analyzed for rs7903146 variant of the TCF7L2 gene. Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. For rs7903146 variant, TT genotype frequency in patients with DFU was 10.8% and in controls was 5.2%. Risk genotype (TT) frequencies showed statistically significant difference between the DFU patients versus non-DM control group (odds ratio = 2.44, P = .037, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-5.64) compared with nonrisk genotype (CC + CT). In the present study, a positive significant association between DFU and the TT genotype of rs7903146 (C/T) variant of TCF7L2 gene was found.

24238363|t|CREB and FoxO1: two transcription factors for the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
24238363|a|Liver plays a major role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in mammals. Under fasting conditions, hepatic glucose production is critical as a source of fuel to maintain the basic functions in other tissues, including skeletal muscle, red blood cells, and the brain. Fasting hormones glucagon and cortisol play major roles during the process, in part by activating the transcription of key enzyme genes in the gluconeogenesis such as phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase). Conversely, gluconeogenic transcription is repressed by pancreatic insulin under feeding conditions, which effectively inhibits transcriptional activator complexes by either promoting post-translational modifications or activating transcriptional inhibitors in the liver, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output. The transcriptional regulatory machineries have been highlighted as targets for type 2 diabetes drugs to control glycemia, so understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms for transcription circuits for hepatic gluconeogenesis is critical in the potential development of therapeutic tools for the treatment of this disease. In this review, the current understanding regarding the roles of two key transcriptional activators, CREB and FoxO1, in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic program is discussed.

24267432|t|Genetic epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in Africa.
24267432|a|The burdens of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are increasing in Africa. T2D and CVD are the result of the complex interaction between inherited characteristics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The epidemic of obesity is largely behind the exploding global incidence of T2D. However, not all obese individuals develop diabetes and positive family history is a powerful risk factor for diabetes and CVD. Recent implementations of high throughput genotyping and sequencing approaches have advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of diabetes and CVD by identifying several genomic loci that were not previously linked to the pathobiology of these diseases. However, African populations have not been adequately represented in these global genomic efforts. Here, we summarize the state of knowledge of the genetic epidemiology of T2D and CVD in Africa and highlight new genomic initiatives that promise to inform disease etiology, public health and clinical medicine in Africa.

24296717|t|Impact of type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants on quantitative glycemic traits reveals mechanistic heterogeneity.
24296717|a|Patients with established type 2 diabetes display both b-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. To define fundamental processes leading to the diabetic state, we examined the relationship between type 2 diabetes risk variants at 37 established susceptibility loci, and indices of proinsulin processing, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. We included data from up to 58,614 nondiabetic subjects with basal measures and 17,327 with dynamic measures. We used additive genetic models with adjustment for sex, age, and BMI, followed by fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analyses. Cluster analyses grouped risk loci into five major categories based on their relationship to these continuous glycemic phenotypes. The first cluster (PPARG, KLF14, IRS1, GCKR) was characterized by primary effects on insulin sensitivity. The second cluster (MTNR1B, GCK) featured risk alleles associated with reduced insulin secretion and fasting hyperglycemia. ARAP1 constituted a third cluster characterized by defects in insulin processing. A fourth cluster (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX/IDE, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B) was defined by loci influencing insulin processing and secretion without a detectable change in fasting glucose levels. The final group contained 20 risk loci with no clear-cut associations to continuous glycemic traits. By assembling extensive data on continuous glycemic traits, we have exposed the diverse mechanisms whereby type 2 diabetes risk variants impact disease predisposition.

24317852|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Common genetic variations of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (encoded by TCF7L2), one of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcription factors for the converging wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt)/b-catenin signalling pathway, are known to be associated with type 2 diabetes. Individuals with at-risk alleles of TCF7L2 exhibit impaired insulin secretion. Although previous studies using animal models have revealed the existence of a relationship between the Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathway and glucose homeostasis, it remains unclear whether TCF7L2 in the pancreatic beta cells might be causally involved in insulin secretion in vivo. In this study, we investigated the role of TCF7L2 expressed in the pancreatic beta cells in glucose homeostasis. METHODS: Three independent groups of genetically engineered mice (DN mice) were generated, in which expression of the dominant-negative form of Tcf7l2 was driven under a rat insulin promoter. Phenotypes of both adult and newborn mice were evaluated. The levels of genes and proteins expressed in isolated islets were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Adult DN mice showed impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin secretion in both oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests. Marked reduction of the beta cell area and whole-pancreas insulin content was observed in both the adult and newborn DN mice. Islets from the DN mice showed decreased gene expressions of Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Irs1, Irs2, Ins1, Ins2 and Mafa, consistent with the deleterious effects of the dominant-negative form of Tcf7l2 on beta cell proliferation and insulin production. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: TCF7L2 expressed in the pancreatic beta cells plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism through regulation of the beta cell mass.

24322204|t|Genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder accounting for effect of body mass index identifies a new risk allele in TCF7L2.
24322204|a|Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and increased metabolic comorbidity. Considering the associated phenotypic traits in genetic studies of complex diseases, either by adjusting for covariates or by investigating interactions between genetic variants and covariates, may help to uncover the missing heritability. However, obesity-related traits have not been incorporated in prior genome-wide analyses of BD as covariates or potential interacting factors. To investigate the genetic factors underlying BD while considering BMI, we conducted genome-wide analyses using data from the Genetic Association Information Network BD study. We analyzed 729,454 genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 388 European-American BD cases and 1020 healthy controls with available data for maximum BMI. We performed genome-wide association analyses of the genetic effects while accounting for the effect of maximum BMI, and also evaluated SNP-BMI interactions. A joint test of main and interaction effects demonstrated significant evidence of association at the genome-wide level with rs12772424 in an intron of TCF7L2 (P=2.85E-8). This SNP exhibited interaction effects, indicating that the bipolar susceptibility risk of this SNP is dependent on BMI. TCF7L2 codes for the transcription factor TCF/LF, part of the Wnt canonical pathway, and is one of the strongest genetic risk variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D). This is consistent with BD pathophysiology, as the Wnt pathway has crucial implications in neurodevelopment, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, and is involved in the mechanisms of action of BD and depression treatments. We hypothesize that genetic risk for BD is BMI dependent, possibly related to common genetic risk with T2D.

24324494|t|Pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetic drugs.
24324494|a|Oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) are used for more than a half-century in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Only in the last five years, intensive research has been conducted in the pharmacogenetics of these drugs based mainly on the retrospective register studies, but only a handful of associations detected in these studies were replicated. The gene variants in CYP2C9, ABCC8/KCNJ11, and TCF7L2 were associated with the effect of sulfonylureas. CYP2C9 encodes sulfonylurea metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9, ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes encode proteins constituting ATP-sensitive K(+) channel which is a therapeutic target for sulfonylureas, and TCF7L2 is a gene with the strongest association with type 2 diabetes. SLC22A1, SLC47A1, and ATM gene variants were repeatedly associated with the response to metformin. SLC22A1 and SLC47A1 encode metformin transporters OCT1 and MATE1, respectively. The function of a gene variant near ATM gene identified by a genome-wide association study is not elucidated so far. The first variant associated with the response to gliptins is a polymorphism in the proximity of CTRB1/2 gene which encodes chymotrypsinogen. Establishment of diabetes pharmacogenetics consortia and reduction in costs of genomics might lead to some significant clinical breakthroughs in this field in a near future.

24371822|t|IRS1, TCF7L2, ADRB1, PPARG, and HHEX polymorphisms associated with atherogenic risk in Mexican population.
24371822|a|Objective. We aimed to explore the association between polymorphisms of IRS1 (rs1801278), TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), ADRB1 (rs1801253), PPARG (rs1801282), and HHEX (rs5015480) genes with atherogenic risk (AI = Total cholesterol/HDL) in MetS, T2D, and healthy populations from the Mexican Social Security Institute. Methodology and Results. Four hundred thirty-five MetS, 517 T2D, and 547 healthy individuals were selected. The association between the SNPs and the atherogenic index was evaluated by multiple linear regression and multinomial logistic regression models. The ADRB1 gene showed a statistically significant association with high-risk atherogenic index, OR = 2.94 (IC 95% 1.64-5.24; P < 0.0001) for the Arg/Gly variant, under the dominant model an OR = 2.96 (IC 95% 1.67-5.25; P < 0.0001), and under the Log additive model an OR = 2.52 (IC 95% 1.54-4.15; P < 0.0001). Conclusions. The Arg389Gly polymorphism of the ADRB1 gene may be a worthy biological marker to predict the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases given a high-risk atherogenic index.

24376643|t|Use of net reclassification improvement (NRI) method confirms the utility of combined genetic risk score to predict type 2 diabetes.
24376643|a|BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified more than 70 novel loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D), some of which have been widely replicated in Asian populations. In this study, we investigated their individual and combined effects on T2D in a Chinese population. METHODOLOGY: We selected 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in T2D genes relating to beta-cell function validated in Asian populations and genotyped them in 5882 Chinese T2D patients and 2569 healthy controls. A combined genetic score (CGS) was calculated by summing up the number of risk alleles or weighted by the effect size for each SNP under an additive genetic model. We tested for associations by either logistic or linear regression analysis for T2D and quantitative traits, respectively. The contribution of the CGS for predicting T2D risk was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and net reclassification improvement (NRI). RESULTS: We observed consistent and significant associations of IGF2BP2, WFS1, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B, HHEX, TCF7L2 and KCNQ1 (8.5*10(-18)<P<8.5*10(-3)), as well as nominal associations of NOTCH2, JAZF1, KCNJ11 and HNF1B (0.05<P<0.1) with T2D risk, which yielded odds ratios ranging from 1.07 to 2.09. The 8 significant SNPs exhibited joint effect on increasing T2D risk, fasting plasma glucose and use of insulin therapy as well as reducing HOMA-b, BMI, waist circumference and younger age of diagnosis of T2D. The addition of CGS marginally increased AUC (2%) but significantly improved the predictive ability on T2D risk by 11.2% and 11.3% for unweighted and weighted CGS, respectively using the NRI approach (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: In a Chinese population, the use of a CGS of 8 SNPs modestly but significantly improved its discriminative ability to predict T2D above and beyond that attributed to clinical risk factors (sex, age and BMI).

24444412|t|Pancreatic gene variants potentially associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor treatment response in Type 2 diabetes.
24444412|a|In the adult pancreas, the expression of the genes PAX4, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, KCNJ11, ABCC8, MTNR1B and WFS1 are mainly restricted to b cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. We have identified these genes as the main regulators of incretin-mediated actions, and therefore they may potentially influence the response of DPP-4 inhibitors. This review represents the first detailed exploration of pancreatic b-cell genes and their variant mechanisms, which could potentially affect the response of DPP-4 inhibitors in Type 2 diabetes. We have focused on the signaling pathways of these genes to understand their roles in gastrointestinal incretin-mediated effects; and finally, we sought to associate gene mechanisms with their Type 2 diabetes risk variants to predict the responses of DPP-4 inhibitors for this disease.

24463962|t|Alternative human liver transcripts of TCF7L2 bind to the gluconeogenesis regulator HNF4a at the protein level.
24463962|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Gene polymorphisms of TCF7L2 are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) plays a role in hepatic glucose metabolism. We therefore addressed the impact of TCF7L2 isoforms on hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4a) and the regulation of gluconeogenesis genes. METHODS: Liver TCF7L2 transcripts were analysed by quantitative PCR in 33 non-diabetic and 31 type 2 diabetic obese individuals genotyped for TCF7L2 rs7903146. To analyse transcriptional regulation by TCF7L2, small interfering RNA transfection, luciferase reporter and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. RESULTS: In livers of diabetic compared with normoglycaemic individuals, five C-terminal TCF7L2 transcripts showed increased expression. The type 2 diabetes risk allele of rs7903146 positively correlated with TCF7L2 expression in livers from normoglycaemic individuals only. In HepG2 cells, transcript and TCF7L2 protein levels were increased upon incubation in high glucose and insulin. Of the exon 13 transcripts, six were increased in a glucose dose-responsive manner. TCF7L2 transcriptionally regulated 29 genes related to glucose metabolism, including glucose-6-phosphatase. In cultured HepG2 cells, TCF7L2 did not regulate HNF4 - and FOXO1 transcription, but did affect HNF4a protein expression. The TCF7L2 isoforms T6 and T8 (without exon 13 and with exon 15/14, respectively) specifically interacted with HNF4a. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The different levels of expression of alternative C-terminal TCF7L2 transcripts in HepG2 cells, in livers of normoglycaemic individuals carrying the rs7901346 type 2 diabetes risk allele and in livers of diabetic individuals suggest that these transcripts play a role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. We also report for the first time a protein interaction in HepG2 cells between HNF4a and the T6 and T8 isoforms of TCF7L2, which suggests a distinct role for these specific alternative transcripts.

24468095|t|Genetic variants for type 2 diabetes and new-onset cancer in Chinese with type 2 diabetes.
24468095|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cancer. This study aimed to evaluate associations between recently reported type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility genetic variants and cancer risk in a prospective cohort of Chinese patients with T2D. METHODS: Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B, HHEX and TCF7L2, all identified from genome-wide association studies of T2D, were genotyped in 5900 T2D patients [age mean    SD = 57    13 years, % males = 46] without any known cancer at baseline. Associations between new-onset of cancer and SNPs were tested by Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment of conventional risk factors. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 8.5    3.3 years, 429 patients (7.3%) developed cancer. Of the T2D-related SNPs, the G-alleles of HHEX rs7923837 (hazard ratio [HR] (95% C.I.) = 1.34 (1.08-1.65); P = 6.7  10(-3) under dominant model) and TCF7L2 rs290481 (HR (95% C.I.) = 1.16 (1.01-1.33); P = 0.040 under additive model) were positively associated with cancer risk, while the G-allele of CDKAL1 rs7756992 was inversely associated (HR (95% C.I.) = 0.80 (0.65-1.00); P = 0.048 under recessive model). The risk alleles of these significant SNPs exhibited combined effect on increasing cancer risk (per-allele HR (95% C.I.) = 1.25 (1.12-1.39); P = 4.8   10(-5)). The adjusted cancer risk was 2.41 (95% C.I. 1.23-4.69) for patients with four risk alleles comparing to patients without risk allele. CONCLUSIONS: T2D-related variants HHEX rs7923837, TCF7L2 rs290481 and CDKAL1 rs7756992 increased cancer risk in patients with diabetes. IMPACT: Our findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cancer in diabetes.

24498581|t|Role of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 of TCF7L2 in inducing nonsense-mediated decay.
24498581|a|BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 (C/T), located in intron 4 of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), has been associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, although the molecular mechanism remain elusive. The TCF7L2 gene is alternatively spliced but an association between genotype and splice variants has not been shown convincingly. We hypothesized that a yet unknown extra exon, containing either the C or T genotype of the SNP rs7903146, could introduce a premature stop codon and consequently result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). FINDINGS: Running the sequences C and T of the SNP region in different servers we found that the two alleles could display differential recognition by splicing factors. The C variant showed the possible inclusion of an unknown exon. This unknown exon contained a stop codon and thus could induce NMD. We then determined that the splicing pattern in isolated mouse islets and MIN6 cells was similar to that in human pancreatic islets. Therefore, we used MIN6 cells to study the splicing of human intron 4: two mini-genes of intron 4 containing either the C/C genotype or the T/T genotype were transfected into MIN6 cells. Our constructs were spliced normally, excluding intron 4, but we did not observe the presence of an extra exon with either construct. CONCLUSIONS: We found that an extra exon could theoretically exist, although we were not able to capture it in our model. A better model is needed to determine whether a theoretical extra exon can induce NMD.

24529562|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism rs7903146 is associated with stroke in type 2 diabetes patients with long disease duration.
24529562|a|Associations between TCF7L2 SNP and diabetic complications and diabetes-related factors were investigated. Subjects with rs7903146 variant had significantly higher prevalence of stroke (24.1% vs. 11.1%; P=0.039) among subjects exhibiting a long disease duration (>= 10 years). In conclusion, the TCF7L2 SNP variant may confer a higher risk of stroke in diabetic patients.

24554506|t|Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation variations caused by chronic glucolipotoxicity in beta-cells.
24554506|a|There is a growing body of literature suggesting the role of interactions between genes and the environment in development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the interplay between environment and genetic in developing and progressing T2MD is not fully understood. To determine the effects of high-glucose-lipid on the status of DNA methylation in beta cells, and clarify the mechanism of glucolipotoxicity on beta-cell deterioration, the DNA methylation profile was detected in beta-cells cultured with high-glucose-lipid medium.We utilized a high throughput NimbleGen RN34 CpG Island _ Promoter Microarray to investigate the DNA methylation profile in beta-cells cultured with high-glucose-lipid medium. To validate the results of microarray, the immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) PCR was used to test the methylation status of some selected genes. The mRNA and protein expression of insulin and Tcf7l2 in these cells were quantified by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively.We have identified a lot of loci which experienced aberrant DNA methylation in beta-cells cultured with high-glucose-lipid medium. The results of MeDIP PCR were consistency to the microarray. An opposite regulation in transcription and translation of Tcf7l2 gene was found. Furthermore, the insulin mRNA and protein expression in beta-cells also decreased after cultured with high-glucose-lipid medium compared with the control cells.We conclude that chronic glucolipotoxicity could induce aberrant DNA methylation of some genes and may affect these genes expression in beta-cells, which might contribute to beta-cell function failure in T2DM and be helpful to explain, at least partially, the mechanism of glucolipotoxicity on beta-cells deterioration.

24558078|t|The pharmacogenetics of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review.
24558078|a|OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to identify which genetic variants predict response to diabetes medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a search of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database) and a manual search to identify original, longitudinal studies of the effect of diabetes medications on incident diabetes, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and postprandial glucose in prediabetes or type 2 diabetes by genetic variation. Two investigators reviewed titles, abstracts, and articles independently. Two investigators abstracted data sequentially and evaluated study quality independently. Quality evaluations were based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association Studies guidelines and Human Genome Epidemiology Network guidance. RESULTS: Of 7,279 citations, we included 34 articles (N = 10,407) evaluating metformin (n = 14), sulfonylureas (n = 4), repaglinide (n = 8), pioglitazone (n = 3), rosiglitazone (n = 4), and acarbose (n = 4). Studies were not standalone randomized controlled trials, and most evaluated patients with diabetes. Significant medication-gene interactions for glycemic outcomes included 1) metformin and the SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC47A1, PRKAB2, PRKAA2, PRKAA1, and STK11 loci; 2) sulfonylureas and the CYP2C9 and TCF7L2 loci; 3) repaglinide and the KCNJ11, SLC30A8, NEUROD1/BETA2, UCP2, and PAX4 loci; 4) pioglitazone and the PPARG2 and PTPRD loci; 5) rosiglitazone and the KCNQ1 and RBP4 loci; and 5) acarbose and the PPARA, HNF4A, LIPC, and PPARGC1A loci. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of pharmacogenetic interactions for metformin, sulfonylureas, repaglinide, thiazolidinediones, and acarbose consistent with their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. While high-quality controlled studies with prespecified analyses are still lacking, our results bring the promise of personalized medicine in diabetes one step closer to fruition.

24574000|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism and clinical phenotype in end-stage renal disease patients.
24574000|a|Variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) have been associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in different populations. Here we investigated the potential association of the rs7903146 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene with clinical profile of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. We examined a cohort of 1065 ESRD patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal disease. The control group consisted of 924 healthy individuals. All subjects were genotyped for the rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction. The genotype distribution and allele frequencies were significantly different between ESRD patients and controls (p < 0.01). The OR for the TT genotype was 2.81 (95% CI 2.08-3.79). Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between subgroups of patients with different clinical phenotypes. The frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy versus non-diabetic renal disease (p = 0.007, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.36-2.11). The statistically significant differences were demonstrated between patients with and without cardiovascular disease, with the OR for T allele 1.57 (95% CI 1.31-1.90). The odds ratio for TT genotype was 2.38 (95% CI 1.62-3.51). In our study the T allele of the rs7903146 SNP in the TCF7L2 gene confers the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. We described for the first time a strong relationship between the TCF7L2 gene variant rs7903146 and cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease patients.

24595071|t|Admixture mapping and subsequent fine-mapping suggests a biologically relevant and novel association on chromosome 11 for type 2 diabetes in African Americans.
24595071|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease that disproportionately affects African Americans. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci that contribute to T2D in European Americans, but few studies have been performed in admixed populations. We first performed a GWAS of 1,563 African Americans from the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records Project and Northwestern University NUgene Project as part of the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. We successfully replicate an association in TCF7L2, previously identified by GWAS in this African American dataset. We were unable to identify novel associations at p<5.0*10(-8) by GWAS. Using admixture mapping as an alternative method for discovery, we performed a genome-wide admixture scan that suggests multiple candidate genes associated with T2D. One finding, TCIRG1, is a T-cell immune regulator expressed in the pancreas and liver that has not been previously implicated for T2D. We performed subsequent fine-mapping to further assess the association between TCIRG1 and T2D in >5,000 African Americans. We identified 13 independent associations between TCIRG1, CHKA, and ALDH3B1 genes on chromosome 11 and T2D. Our results suggest a novel region on chromosome 11 identified by admixture mapping is associated with T2D in African Americans.

24603685|t|Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic donors identifies candidate genes that influence insulin secretion.
24603685|a|Impaired insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Epigenetics may affect disease susceptibility. To describe the human methylome in pancreatic islets and determine the epigenetic basis of T2D, we analyzed DNA methylation of 479,927 CpG sites and the transcriptome in pancreatic islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We provide a detailed map of the global DNA methylation pattern in human islets, b- and a-cells. Genomic regions close to the transcription start site showed low degrees of methylation and regions further away from the transcription start site such as the gene body, 3'UTR and intergenic regions showed a higher degree of methylation. While CpG islands were hypomethylated, the surrounding 2 kb shores showed an intermediate degree of methylation, whereas regions further away (shelves and open sea) were hypermethylated in human islets, b- and a-cells. We identified 1,649 CpG sites and 853 genes, including TCF7L2, FTO and KCNQ1, with differential DNA methylation in T2D islets after correction for multiple testing. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites had an intermediate degree of methylation and were underrepresented in CpG islands (    7%) and overrepresented in the open sea (    60%). 102 of the differentially methylated genes, including CDKN1A, PDE7B, SEPT9 and EXOC3L2, were differentially expressed in T2D islets. Methylation of CDKN1A and PDE7B promoters in vitro suppressed their transcriptional activity. Functional analyses demonstrated that identified candidate genes affect pancreatic b- and a-cells as Exoc3l silencing reduced exocytosis and overexpression of Cdkn1a, Pde7b and Sept9 perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion in clonal b- and a-cells, respectively. Together, our data can serve as a reference methylome in human islets. We provide new target genes with altered DNA methylation and expression in human T2D islets that contribute to perturbed insulin and glucagon secretion. These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of T2D.

24637646|t|Cross-sectional and longitudinal replication analyses of genome-wide association loci of type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese.
24637646|a|This study aimed to examine genomic loci of type 2 diabetes (T2D) initially identified by genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry for their associations with T2D and quantitative glycemic traits, as well as their effects on longitudinal change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and T2D development, in the Chinese population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 25 loci were genotyped in a large case-control sample of 10,001 subjects (5,338 T2D cases and 4,663 controls) and a prospective cohort of 1,881 Chinese. In the case-control sample, 8 SNPs in or near WFS1, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CDC123, HHEX, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B were significantly associated with T2D (P<0.05). Thirteen SNPs were associated with quantitative glycemic traits. For example, the most significant SNP, rs10811661 near CDKN2A/2B (P=1.11*10(-8) for T2D), was also associated with 2-h glucose level of an oral glucose tolerance test (P=9.11*10(-3)) and insulinogenic index (P=2.71*10(-2)). In the cohort study, individuals carrying more risk alleles of the replicated SNPs had greater FPG increase and T2D incidence in a 7.5-year follow-up period, with each quartile increase in the number of risk alleles being associated with a 0.06 mmol/l greater increase in FPG (P=0.03) and 19% higher odds of developing T2D (P=0.058). Our study identified the associations of several established T2D-loci in Europeans with T2D and quantitative glycemic traits in the Chinese population. The prospective data also suggest their potential role in the risk prediction of T2D in the Chinese population.

24639413|t|Metabolic, hormonal characteristics, and genetic variants of TCF7L2 associated with development of gestational diabetes mellitus in Mexican women.
24639413|a|BACKGROUND: Variation in TCF7L2 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes and with Gestational diabetes mellitus GDM in several populations, but there are not data in Mexican women with GDM. In this study we examined metabolic and hormonal measurements as well as TCF7L2 genetic variants. METHODS: We selected 108 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 90 with GDM according to 2010 ADA criteria matched for gestational week. We collected blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and measured concentrations of blood glucose, HbA1c, lipids profile, insulin and GLP-1. The genotyping of rs7903146 and rs12255372 polymorphisms were made with PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Actual and pre-gestational BMI, fasting glucose, and HbA1c were higher (p   <   0.001), and HDL-Cholesterol was lower (p   <   0.02) in DMG women than NTG women. No significant differences were found for lipids, insulin, and HOMAIR. GDM women had high GLP-1 levels (32 vs 24, p   <   0.004) and decreased b-cell function (266 vs 438, p   <   0.001). The frequency of rs12255372 risk allele in GDM women was significantly higher than in NGT women (X(2)    =   8.96; p   <   0.003), and confers a risk for GDM (OR   =   9.1, 95% CI 2.8-29; p   <   0.0002; and OR   =   4.3, 95% CI 1.6-11.4; p   <   0.003 based on dominant and co-dominant model respectively). The generalized linear model showed that low beta function, high pre-gestational BMI and rs12255372 risk allele are independently associated with GDM. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated GLP-1 levels in GDM women suggested some abnormality on insulin secretion. The low b-cell function, high pre-gestational BMI, and rs12255372 risk allele are risk factors independently associated with the development GDM. This article is protected by copyright.

24667787|t|Characterization of the transcriptional machinery bound across the widely presumed type 2 diabetes causal variant, rs7903146, within TCF7L2.
24667787|a|Resolving the underlying functional mechanism to a given genetic association has proven extremely challenging. However, the strongest associated type 2 diabetes (T2D) locus reported to date, TCF7L2, presents an opportunity for translational analyses, as many studies in multiple ethnicities strongly point to SNP rs7903146 in intron 3 as being the causal variant within this gene. We carried out oligo pull-down combined with mass spectrophotometry (MS) to elucidate the specific transcriptional machinery across this SNP using protein extracts from HCT116 cells. We observed that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is by far the most abundant binding factor. Pursuing the possibility of a feedback mechanism, we observed that PARP-1, along with the next most abundant binding proteins, DNA topoisomerase I and ATP-dependent RNA helicase A, dimerize with the TCF7L2 protein and with each other. We uncovered further evidence of a feedback mechanism using a luciferase reporter approach, including observing expression differences between alleles for rs7903146. We also found that there was an allelic difference in the MS results for proteins with less abundant binding, namely X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 and RPA/p70. Our results point to a protein complex binding across rs7903146 within TCF7L2 and suggests a possible mechanism by which this locus confers its T2D risk.

24719615|t|Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity: follow-up of findings from genome-wide association studies.
24719615|a|Elucidating the underlying genetic variations influencing various complex diseases is one of the major challenges currently facing clinical genetic research. Although these variations are often difficult to uncover, approaches such as genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful at finding statistically significant associations between specific genomic loci and disease susceptibility. GWAS has been especially successful in elucidating genetic variants that influence type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity/body mass index (BMI). Specifically, several GWASs have confirmed that a variant in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) confers risk for T2D, while a variant in fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) confers risk for obesity/BMI; indeed both of these signals are considered the most statistically associated loci discovered for these respective traits to date. The discovery of these two key loci in this context has been invaluable for providing novel insight into mechanisms of heritability and disease pathogenesis. As follow-up studies of TCF7L2 and FTO have typically lead the way in how to follow up a GWAS discovery, we outline what has been learned from such investigations and how they have implications for the myriad of other loci that have been subsequently reported in this disease context.

24736664|t|Validation of type 2 diabetes risk variants identified by genome-wide association studies in Han Chinese population: a replication study and meta-analysis.
24736664|a|BACKGROUND: Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving European populations have successfully identified risk genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the effects conferred by these variants in Han Chinese population have not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of 24 risk genetic variants with reported associations from European GWAS in 3,040 Han Chinese subjects in Taiwan (including 1,520 T2DM cases and 1,520 controls). The discriminative power of the prediction models with and without genotype scores was compared. We further meta-analyzed the association of these variants with T2DM by pooling all candidate-gene association studies conducted in Han Chinese. RESULTS: Five risk variants in IGF2BP2 (rs4402960, rs1470579), CDKAL1 (rs10946398), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and HHEX (rs1111875) genes were nominally associated with T2DM in our samples. The odds ratio was 2.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.81-2.73, P<0.0001) for subjects with the highest genetic score quartile (score>34) as compared with subjects with the lowest quartile (score<29). The incoporation of genotype score into the predictive model increased the C-statistics from 0.627 to 0.657 (P<0.0001). These estimates are very close to those observed in European populations. Gene-environment interaction analysis showed a significant interaction between rs13266634 in SLC30A8 gene and age on T2DM risk (P<0.0001). Further meta-analysis pooling 20 studies in Han Chinese confirmed the association of 10 genetic variants in IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, JAZF1, SCL30A8, HHEX, TCF7L2, EXT2, and FTO genes with T2DM. The effect sizes conferred by these risk variants in Han Chinese were similar to those observed in Europeans but the allele frequencies differ substantially between two populations. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the association of 10 variants identified by European GWAS with T2DM in Han Chinese population. The incorporation of genotype scores into the prediction model led to a small but significant improvement in T2DM prediction.

24749055|t|Untangling the interplay of genetic and metabolic influences on beta-cell function: Examples of potential therapeutic implications involving TCF7L2 and FFAR1.
24749055|a|Deteriorating beta-cell function is a common feature of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we briefly address the regulation of beta-cell function, and discuss some of the main determinants of beta-cell failure. We will focus on the role of interactions between the genetic background and metabolic environment (insulin resistance, fuel supply and flux as well as metabolic signaling). We present data on the function of the strongest common diabetes risk variant, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in TCF7L2. As also mirrored by its interaction with glycemia on insulin secretion, this SNP in large part confers resistance against the incretin effect. Genetic influence on insulin secretion also interacts with free fatty acids, as evidenced by data on rs1573611 in FFAR1. Several medications marketed by now or currently under development for diabetes treatment engage these pathways, and therapeutic implications from these findings are soon to be expected.

24812430|t|Altered DNA methylation and differential expression of genes influencing metabolism and inflammation in adipose tissue from subjects with type 2 diabetes.
24812430|a|Genetics, epigenetics, and environment may together affect the susceptibility for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aim was to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying T2D using genome-wide expression and DNA methylation data in adipose tissue from monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D and independent case-control cohorts. In adipose tissue from diabetic twins, we found decreased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation; carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism; and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and glycan degradation. The most differentially expressed genes included ELOVL6, GYS2, FADS1, SPP1 (OPN), CCL18, and IL1RN. We replicated these results in adipose tissue from an independent case-control cohort. Several candidate genes for obesity and T2D (e.g., IRS1 and VEGFA) were differentially expressed in discordant twins. We found a heritable contribution to the genome-wide DNA methylation variability in twins. Differences in methylation between monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D were subsequently modest. However, 15,627 sites, representing 7,046 genes including PPARG, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, and IRS1, showed differential DNA methylation in adipose tissue from unrelated subjects with T2D compared with control subjects. A total of 1,410 of these sites also showed differential DNA methylation in the twins discordant for T2D. For the differentially methylated sites, the heritability estimate was 0.28. We also identified copy number variants (CNVs) in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D. Taken together, subjects with T2D exhibit multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes in adipose tissue relevant to the development of the disease.

24815492|t|Genetic polymorphisms of TCF7L2 lack influence on risk of the polycystic ovary syndrome - a systemic analysis.
24815492|a|BACKGROUND: The results of previous researches that analyzed the association between genetic polymorphisms of transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2, rs7903146) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were conflicting. Current systematic analysis was conducted to re-explore this association using updated materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed database was used for data collection and the final search was conducted on January 3, 2014. For TCF7L2 rs7903146, a non-significant slight increase in risk of PCOS development was observed under three genetic models (dominant model: OR=1.06, 95%CI: 0.93-1.21, p>0.05; recessive model: OR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.87-1.43, p> 0.05; homozygous model: OR=1.14, 95%CI: 0.87-1.47, p>0.05). In the subgroup analyses in Asian group, allele susceptibility of PCOS was calculated (allele model: OR=1.00, 95%CI: 0.74-1.35, p>0.05; dominant model: OR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.71-1.35, p>0.05; recessive model: OR=1.79, 95%CI: 0.33-9.84, p>0.05; homozygous model: OR=1.78, 95%CI: 0.32-9.80, p>0.05), the differences were again not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this systemic analysis suggest that the polymorphism of TCF7L2 rs7903146 may not be associated with the susceptibility to PCOS.

24823979|t|[Phenotypes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes].
24823979|a|Type 2 Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease which harbors several different pathomechanistic entities. For a successful prevention, it is important to understand the exact pathomechanisms. Overt type 2 Diabetes usually develops through an intermediary state called prediabetes, which is also heterogeneous. This state is especially important, because it already confers a higher risk for diabetes-associated complications. Therefore, detection of prediabetes and prevention of its progression to diabetes would be desirable. In this review, we describe the phenotypes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We also try to envision the first steps of a future phenotype-oriented diabetes therapy.

24829485|t|Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular health: Teachings of the PREDIMED study.
24829485|a|The PREDIMED (Prevenci  n con Dieta Mediterr  nea) study was designed to assess the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) without any energy restriction on incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial in individuals at high risk. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 diet groups: 1) MeDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO); 2) MeDiet supplemented with nuts; and 3) control diet (advice on a low-fat diet). After 4.8 y, 288 major CVD events occurred in 7447 participants; crude hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.91) for the MeDiet + EVOO and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.94) for the MeDiet + nuts compared with the control group. Respective hazard ratios for incident diabetes (273 cases) among 3541 participants without diabetes were 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.85) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.10) compared with the control group. After 1-y follow-up, participants in the MeDiet + nuts group showed a significant 13.7% reduction in prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared with reductions of 6.7% and 2.0% in the MeDiet + EVOO and control groups, respectively. Analyses of intermediate markers of cardiovascular risk demonstrated beneficial effects of the MeDiets on blood pressure, lipid profiles, lipoprotein particles, inflammation, oxidative stress, and carotid atherosclerosis, as well as on the expression of proatherogenic genes involved in vascular events and thrombosis. Nutritional genomics studies demonstrated interactions between a MeDiet and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2), cholesteryl ester transfer protein plasma (CETP), and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms. The PREDIMED study results demonstrate that a high-unsaturated fat and antioxidant-rich dietary pattern such as the MeDiet is a useful tool in the prevention of CVD.

24906949|t|Influence of TCF7L2 gene variants on the therapeutic response to the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin.
24906949|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Individuals carrying variants of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. These metabolic genetic risk factors have been linked to diminished pancreatic islet-cell responsiveness to incretins, thus pharmacological interventions aimed at amplifying endogenous incretin biology may be affected. However, clinical evidence from randomised controlled trials so far is lacking. We investigated the influence of TCF7L2 risk alleles on the response to treatment with the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin from four 24 week, phase III, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: Pharmacogenomic samples and clinical data were available from 961 patients with type 2 diabetes. Whole-blood DNA samples were genotyped for TCF7L2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in conjunction with assessments of 24 week changes in HbA1c. RESULTS: Linagliptin lowered HbA1c meaningfully in all three genotypes of rs7903146 (non-risk variant carriers CC [n = 356]: -0.82% [-9.0 mmol/mol], p < 0.0001; heterozygous CT [n = 264]: -0.77% [-8.4 mmol/mol], p < 0.0001; homozygous risk variant carriers TT [n = 73]: -0.57% [-6.2 mmol/mol], p < 0.0006). No significant treatment differences were seen between CC and CT patients, although HbA1c response was reduced in TT compared with CC patients (~0.26% [~2.8 mmol/mol], p = 0.0182). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Linagliptin significantly improved hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes both with and without the TCF7L2 gene diabetes risk alleles. However, differences in treatment response were observed, indicating that diabetes susceptibility genes may be an important contributor to the inter-individual variability of treatment response.

24906951|t|Type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene variants predispose to adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.
24906951|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is phenotypically a hybrid of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Genetically LADA is poorly characterised but does share genetic predisposition with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to improve the genetic characterisation of LADA and hypothesised that type 2 diabetes-associated gene variants also predispose to LADA, and that the associations would be strongest in LADA patients with low levels of GAD autoantibodies (GADA). METHODS: We assessed 41 type 2 diabetes-associated gene variants in Finnish (phase I) and Swedish (phase II) patients with LADA (n = 911) or type 1 diabetes (n = 406), all diagnosed after the age of 35 years, as well as in non-diabetic control individuals 40 years or older (n = 4,002). RESULTS: Variants in the ZMIZ1 (rs12571751, p = 4.1 * 10(-5)) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, p = 5.8 * 10(-4)) loci were strongly associated with LADA. Variants in the KCNQ1 (rs2237895, p = 0.0012), HHEX (rs1111875, p = 0.0024 in Finns) and MTNR1B (rs10830963, p = 0.0039) loci showed the strongest association in patients with low GADA, supporting the hypothesis that the disease in these patients is more like type 2 diabetes. In contrast, variants in the KLHDC5 (rs10842994, p = 9.5 * 10(-4) in Finns), TP53INP1 (rs896854, p = 0.005), CDKAL1 (rs7756992, p = 7.0 * 10(-4); rs7754840, p = 8.8 * 10(-4)) and PROX1 (rs340874, p = 0.003) loci showed the strongest association in patients with high GADA. For type 1 diabetes, a strong association was seen for MTNR1B (rs10830963, p = 3.2 * 10(-6)) and HNF1A (rs2650000, p = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: LADA and adult-onset type 1 diabetes share genetic risk variants with type 2 diabetes, supporting the idea of a hybrid form of diabetes and distinguishing them from patients with classical young-onset type 1 diabetes.

24914535|t|Differential methylation of TCF7L2 promoter in peripheral blood DNA in newly diagnosed, drug-na  ve patients with type 2 diabetes.
24914535|a|TCF7L2 is the susceptibility gene for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with the largest effect on disease risk that has been discovered to date. However, the mechanisms by which TCF7L2 contributes to the disease remain largely elusive. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in DNA methylation patterns, might have a role in the pathophysiology of T2D. This study aimed to investigate the differences in terms of DNA methylation profile of TCF7L2 promoter gene between type 2 diabetic patients and age- and Body Mass Index (BMI)- matched controls. We included 93 type 2 diabetic patients that were recently diagnosed for T2D and exclusively on diet (without any pharmacological treatment). DNA was extracted from whole blood and DNA methylation was assessed using the Sequenom EpiTYPER system. Type 2 diabetic patients were more insulin resistant than their matched controls (mean HOMA IR 2.6 vs 1.8 in controls, P<0.001) and had a poorer beta-cell function (mean HOMA B 75.7 vs. 113.6 in controls, P<0.001). Results showed that 59% of the CpGs analyzed in TCF7L2 promoter had significant differences between type 2 diabetic patients and matched controls. In addition, fasting glucose, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol correlated with methylation in specific CpG sites of TCF7L2 promoter. After adjustment by age, BMI, gender, physical inactivity, waist circumference, smoking status and diabetes status uniquely fasting glucose, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol remained significant. Taken together, newly diagnosed, drug-na  ve type 2 diabetic patients display specific epigenetic changes at the TCF7L2 promoter as compared to age- and BMI-matched controls. Methylation in TCF7L2 promoter is further correlated with fasting glucose in peripheral blood DNA, which sheds new light on the role of epigenetic regulation of TCF7L2 in T2D.

24925104|t|Clinical and non-targeted metabolomic profiling of homozygous carriers of Transcription Factor 7-like 2 variant rs7903146.
24925104|a|An important role of the type 2 diabetes risk variant rs7903146 in TCF7L2 in metabolic actions of various tissues, in particular of the liver, has recently been demonstrated by functional animal studies. Accordingly, the TT diabetes risk allele may lead to currently unknown alterations in human. Our study revealed no differences in the kinetics of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and non-esterified fatty acids during an OGTT in homozygous participants from a German diabetes risk cohort (n = 1832) carrying either the rs7903146 CC (n = 15) or the TT (n = 15) genotype. However, beta-cell function was impaired for TT carriers. Covering more than 4000 metabolite ions the plasma metabolome did not reveal any differences between genotypes. Our study argues against a relevant impact of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on the systemic level in humans, but confirms the role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in humans as a mechanism impairing insulin secretion.

24953961|t|Effects of palmitate on genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets.
24953961|a|BACKGROUND: Circulating free fatty acids are often elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obese individuals. Chronic exposure to high levels of saturated fatty acids has detrimental effects on islet function and insulin secretion. Altered gene expression and epigenetics may contribute to T2D and obesity. However, there is limited information on whether fatty acids alter the genome-wide transcriptome profile in conjunction with DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets. To dissect the molecular mechanisms linking lipotoxicity to impaired insulin secretion, we investigated the effects of a 48 h palmitate treatment in vitro on genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in human pancreatic islets. METHODS: Genome-wide mRNA expression was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip(  ) Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript-based array (n = 13) and genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n = 13) in human pancreatic islets exposed to palmitate or control media for 48 h. A non-parametric paired Wilcoxon statistical test was used to analyze mRNA expression. Apoptosis was measured using Apo-ONE(  ) Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay (n = 4). RESULTS: While glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased, there was no significant effect on apoptosis in human islets exposed to palmitate. We identified 1,860 differentially expressed genes in palmitate-treated human islets. These include candidate genes for T2D, such as TCF7L2, GLIS3, HNF1B and SLC30A8. Additionally, genes in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism and one carbon pool by folate were differentially expressed in palmitate-treated human islets. Palmitate treatment altered the global DNA methylation level and DNA methylation levels of CpG island shelves and shores, 5'UTR, 3'UTR and gene body regions in human islets. Moreover, 290 genes with differential expression had a corresponding change in DNA methylation, for example, TCF7L2 and GLIS3. Importantly, out of the genes differentially expressed due to palmitate treatment in human islets, 67 were also associated with BMI and 37 were differentially expressed in islets from T2D patients. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that palmitate treatment of human pancreatic islets gives rise to epigenetic modifications that together with altered gene expression may contribute to impaired insulin secretion and T2D.

24959828|t|Genetic association study with metabolic syndrome and metabolic-related traits in a cross-sectional sample and a 10-year longitudinal sample of chinese elderly population.
24959828|a|BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been known as partly heritable, while the number of genetic studies on MetS and metabolic-related traits among Chinese elderly was limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed among 2 014 aged participants from September 2009 to June 2010 in Beijing, China. An additional longitudinal study was carried out among the same study population from 2001 to 2010. Biochemical profile and anthropometric parameters of all the participants were measured. The associations of 23 SNPs located within 17 candidate genes (MTHFR, PPARy, LPL, INSIG, TCF7L2, FTO, KCNJ11, JAZF1, CDKN2A/B, ADIPOQ, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1, MTNR1B, IRS1, ACE) with overweight and obesity, diabetes, metabolic phenotypes, and MetS were examined in both studies. RESULTS: In this Chinese elderly population, prevalence of overweight, central obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and MetS were 48.3%, 71.0%, 32.4%, 75.7%, 68.3% and 54.5%, respectively. In the cross-sectional analyses, no SNP was found to be associated with MetS. Genotype TT of SNP rs4402960 within the gene IGF2BP2 was associated with overweight (odds ratio (OR) =0.479, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.316-0.724, p=0.001) and genotype CA of SNP rs1801131 within the gene MTHFR was associated with hypertension (OR=1.560, 95% CI: 1.194-2.240, p=0.001). However, these associations were not observed in the longitudinal analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The associations of SNP rs4402960 with overweight as well as the association of SNP rs1801131 with hypertension were found to be statistically significant. No SNP was identified to be associated with MetS in our study with statistical significance.

24961829|t|TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes risk variant, lifestyle factors, and incidence of prostate cancer.
24961829|a|BACKGROUND: Variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), the strongest genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), may play a role in prostate cancer (PCa) depending on lifestyle factors. The aims of this study were to determine if TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with risk of PCa and if the association is modified by lifestyle factors independently of T2D status. METHODS: We prospectively followed 8,558 men in the Malm   Diet and Cancer Study from baseline 1991-1996 until end of 2009. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between rs7903146 T2D-risk allele (T) and PCa. Effect modification by incident T2D status, fasting glucose levels, dietary, and lifestyle risk factors were tested. RESULTS: During follow-up 855 incident PCa cases were registered. We observed a non-significant tendency for the TCF7L2 variant to associate with higher risk of PCa, which was unaffected by adjustment for incident T2D (HR   =   1.24; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.60; P   =   0.079) but more pronounced among subjects who developed T2D (HR   =   1.91, 95% CI: 0.88, 4.14; P   =   0.064). In a sub-sample of hyperglycemic men we observed an increased risk of PCa among T-allele carriers (HR   =   2.72, 95% CI: 1.22, 6.04; P   =   0.014; P(interaction)    =   0.056). T-allele carriers with higher number of lifestyle risk factors had an increased risk of PCa (P(interaction)    =   0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We found no independent association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and PCa risk. However, among hyperglycemic men we observed that the risk allele may increase risk of PCa. The association between rs7903146 and PCa risk may also be modified by lifestyle factors.

25015099|t|TCF7L2 is a master regulator of insulin production and processing.
25015099|a|Genome-wide association studies have revealed >60 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the underlying causal variants and functional mechanisms remain largely elusive. Although variants in TCF7L2 confer the strongest risk of T2D among common variants by presumed effects on islet function, the molecular mechanisms are not yet well understood. Using RNA-sequencing, we have identified a TCF7L2-regulated transcriptional network responsible for its effect on insulin secretion in rodent and human pancreatic islets. ISL1 is a primary target of TCF7L2 and regulates proinsulin production and processing via MAFA, PDX1, NKX6.1, PCSK1, PCSK2 and SLC30A8, thereby providing evidence for a coordinated regulation of insulin production and processing. The risk T-allele of rs7903146 was associated with increased TCF7L2 expression, and decreased insulin content and secretion. Using gene expression profiles of 66 human pancreatic islets donors', we also show that the identified TCF7L2-ISL1 transcriptional network is regulated in a genotype-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that not only synthesis of proinsulin is regulated by TCF7L2 but also processing and possibly clearance of proinsulin and insulin. These multiple targets in key pathways may explain why TCF7L2 has emerged as the gene showing one of the strongest associations with T2D.

25048152|t|A gene variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.
25048152|a|OBJECTIVE: Adipokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance during pregnancy. We studied the association of genetic variants linked with type 2 diabetes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) subjects and its influence on maternal adipokines. STUDY DESIGN: We recruited 25 healthy pregnant women (Controls) and 45 women with GDM at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Maternal blood samples were collected at recruitment and delivery. Adipokines were determined at both sampling times. Genomic DNA was extracted from recruitment samples and FTO rs9939609, TCF7L2 rs4506565, rs7901695, rs12243326, rs12255372 and rs7903146, INSIG2 rs7566605, SREBF1 rs114001633, rs45535737 and rs12941356 and FATP4 rs2003560 genotyped. RESULTS: Serum adiponectin was significantly lower in GDM than Controls at recruitment and showed a similar trend at delivery (p=0.060). In contrast, resistin tended to higher levels in GDM only at recruitment. TCF7L2 rs4506565 (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.97-5.01; p=0.031) and FTO rs9939609 (OR=2.17, 95% CI: 1.07-4.41; p=0.039) were associated with GDM risk. Women carrying the T allele of TCF7L2 rs4506565 had increases in plasma resistin of 9.38  g/L (95% CI 1.39-17.37; p=0.022) per allele; this association remained significant after adjusting for pre-gestational body weight. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 rs4506565 variant (T/T) is associated with increased risk of GDM and plasma resistin concentrations in women with GDM.

25053586|t|Differential transcriptome analysis of diabetes resistant and sensitive mouse islets reveals significant overlap with human diabetes susceptibility genes.
25053586|a|Type 2 diabetes in humans and in obese mice is polygenic. In recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genetic markers explaining small portion of the genetic contribution to the disease were discovered. However, functional evidence linking these genes with the pathogenesis of diabetes is scarce. We have performed RNA-sequencing based transcriptomics of islets from two obese mice, a diabetes-susceptible (NZO) and a diabetes-resistant (B6-ob/ob) mouse after a short glucose challenge in order to compare these results with human data. Aligning 2328 differentially expressed genes to 106 human diabetes candidate genes revealed an overlap of 20 genes, including TCF7L2, IGFBP2, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, GRB10 and PRC1. Our data provide a functional validation of human diabetes candidate genes including those involved in regulating islet cell recovery and proliferation, and identify additional candidates that could be involved in human beta-cell failure.

25058603|t|Differential transcriptional and posttranslational transcription factor 7-like regulation among nondiabetic individuals and type 2 diabetic patients.
25058603|a|Human genetic studies have revealed that the T minor allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is strongly associated with an increased risk of diabetes by 30%-40%. Molecular and clinical studies are of great importance for understanding how this unique variation in TCF7L2 influences type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset and progression. At the molecular level, some studies have been performed in diabetic mice and pancreatic islets from healthy human donors. Whereas TCF7L2 mRNA levels are up-regulated in islets, protein levels are down-regulated. We performed studies on TCF7L2 splicing, mRNA expression, and protein levels in immortalized human lymphocytes from nondiabetic individuals and T2D patients carrying the C/C or the at-risk T/T genotype. Our results show differential expression of TCF7L2 splice variants between nondiabetic and T2D patients carrying the at-risk genotype, as well as differences in protein levels. Therefore, we investigated the regulation of splice variants, and our results propose that splicing of exon 4 is under control of the serine-arginine-rich factor transformer 2 b (TRA2B). Finally, we studied the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, looking for a posttranslational explanation. We saw a shift in the activation of these pathways between nondiabetic individuals and T2D patients carrying the at-risk genotype. These results suggest that, in human immortalized lymphocytes carrying the at-risk T/T genotype, first the differential expression of TCF7L2 splice variants implies a regulation, at least for exon 4, by TRA2B and second, the differential protein levels between both T/T carriers point to a different activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways.

25102180|t|Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in African Americans provides insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes.
25102180|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more prevalent in African Americans than in Europeans. However, little is known about the genetic risk in African Americans despite the recent identification of more than 70 T2D loci primarily by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of T2D in African Americans, the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes in African Americans (MEDIA) Consortium examined 17 GWAS on T2D comprising 8,284 cases and 15,543 controls in African Americans in stage 1 analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis was conducted in each study under the additive model after adjustment for age, sex, study site, and principal components. Meta-analysis of approximately 2.6 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in all studies was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect model. Replications were performed to follow up 21 loci in up to 6,061 cases and 5,483 controls in African Americans, and 8,130 cases and 38,987 controls of European ancestry. We identified three known loci (TCF7L2, HMGA2 and KCNQ1) and two novel loci (HLA-B and INS-IGF2) at genome-wide significance (4.15 * 10(-94)<P<5 * 10(-8), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09 to 1.36). Fine-mapping revealed that 88 of 158 previously identified T2D or glucose homeostasis loci demonstrated nominal to highly significant association (2.2 * 10(-23) < locus-wide P<0.05). These novel and previously identified loci yielded a sibling relative risk of 1.19, explaining 17.5% of the phenotypic variance of T2D on the liability scale in African Americans. Overall, this study identified two novel susceptibility loci for T2D in African Americans. A substantial number of previously reported loci are transferable to African Americans after accounting for linkage disequilibrium, enabling fine mapping of causal variants in trans-ethnic meta-analysis studies.

25117344|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphisms and diabetic retinopathy: a systematic review.
25117344|a|The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased, as well as complications including diabetic retinopathy. Polymorphisms in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) have been associated with T2DM, with the strongest association attributed to the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146. In this review, we searched the current literature to determine whether an association exists between TCF7L2 polymorphisms rs7903146 with diabetic retinopathy. A systematic search was performed of EMBASE, PubMed, and Scopus using the following search terms: diabetic, retinopathy, polymorphism, genetic, transcription factor 7-like 2, TCF7L2. A manual search was also performed. There was no language or study design restriction. Three full articles and one abstract were reviewed. All studies were retrospective case-control studies that compared the frequency of the wild-type CC genotype and genotypes with the risk T allele. None of the studies found a statistically significant odds ratio. While the number of studies examined was small, this review suggests that there is no risk of diabetic retinopathy among individuals with the TCF7L2 polymorphisms rs7903146; however, the polymorphism may play a small role in diabetic retinopathy. Future prospective studies and trials involving diverse ethnicities that adjust for confounding variables are required to understand the association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and diabetic retinopathy.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies identified loci for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), but few studies clarified the effect of genetic polymorphisms of ADIPOQ and TCF7L2 on risk of T2DM. We attempted to elucidate association between T2DM and polymorphic variations of both in Taiwan's Chinese Han population, with our retrospective case-control study genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ and TCF7L2 genes both in 149 T2DM patients and in 139 healthy controls from Taiwan. Statistical analysis gauged association of these polymorphisms with risk of T2DM to show ADIPOQ rs1501299 polymorphism variations strongly correlated with T2DM risk (P = 0.042), with rs2241766 polymorphism being not associated with T2DM (P = 0.967). However, both polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs12255372 of TCF7L2 were rarely detected in Taiwanese people. This study avers that ADIPOQ rs1501299 polymorphism contributes to risk of T2DM in the Taiwanese population.

25127329|t|Studying progression from glucose intolerance to type 2 diabetes in obese children.
25127329|a|AIM: Identification of metabolic and genetic factors capable to mediate progression from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) through impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in childhood obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three groups of obese children with NGT (n=54), IGT (n=35), and T2D (n=62) were evaluated. A control group of non-obese normal children (n=210) was also studied. In obese patients, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. Insulin resistance (IR) was assessed using HOMA-IR index. Insulin sensitivity (IS) was assessed according to the Matsuda formula. Genomic DNA from obese and control children was genotyped for genetic variants of PPARG, ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, FTO, TCF7L2, and KCNJ11 using a real-time PCR strategy. The unpaired Student's t-test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way test were used to compare quantitative data in two and more groups. To assess the extent to which the various genetic variants were associated with pathology, ORs (odds ratios) and 95% CI (confidence interval) were estimated. RESULTS: In T2D children, HOMA-IR value (7.5  3.1) was significantly (P<0.001) higher than that in IGT (4.21  2.25) and NGT (4.1  2.4) subjects. The Matsuda IS index was significantly increased in normoglycemic patients compared to IGT individuals (2.8  1.75 vs. 2.33  1.2, P<0.05). The Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARG was significantly associated with obesity (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.19-2.55, P=0.004) and T2D in obesity (OR=2.01, 95% CI=1.24-3.26, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: IR is a major risk factor that mediates progression from NGT to clinical T2D in Russian obese children. This progression may be genetically influenced by the Pro12Ala variant of PPARG.

25159268|t|Aging and cardiovascular diseases: The role of gene-diet interactions.
25159268|a|In the study of longevity, increasing importance is being placed on the concept of healthy aging rather than considering the total number of years lived. Although the concept of healthy lifespan needs to be defined better, we know that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main age-related diseases. Thus, controlling risk factors will contribute to reducing their incidence, leading to healthy lifespan. CVDs are complex diseases influenced by numerous genetic and environmental factors. Numerous gene variants that are associated with a greater or lesser risk of the different types of CVD and of intermediate phenotypes (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes) have been successfully identified. However, despite the close link between aging and CVD, studies analyzing the genes related to human longevity have not obtained consistent results and there has been little coincidence in the genes identified in both fields. The APOE gene stands out as an exception, given that it has been identified as being relevant in CVD and longevity. This review analyzes the genomic and epigenomic factors that may contribute to this, ranging from identifying longevity genes in model organisms to the importance of gene-diet interactions (outstanding among which is the case of the TCF7L2 gene).

25185411|t|Association of rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs290487 polymorphisms in TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes in an Iranian Kurdish ethnic group.
25185411|a|BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are well known risk variants for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The association between TCF7L2 SNPs and T2DM has been investigated in several studies, but the results are controversial. In this study, we investigated whether the rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs290487 polymorphisms of TCF7L2 are associated with T2DM per se or metabolic traits related to this disease in a Kurdish ethnic group of Iran. METHODS: In all, 173 patients with T2DM and 173 normoglycemic subjects were included in this study. All subjects were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Genotypic and allelic frequencies were then analyzed in each group. Serum lipids, fasting glucose, fasting serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c levels were determined by conventional methods. RESULTS: T-allele and genotype frequencies of rs7903146, rs12255372, and rs290487 were significantly different between T2DM and control subjects. The CT genotype (OR = 1.98, p = 0.008), TT genotype (OR = 3.54, p = 0.024), and the dominant model (OR = 2.16, p = 0.002) of rs7903146 were associated with T2DM. The GT genotype (OR = 2.23, p = 0.005), TT genotype (OR = 4.25, p = 0.046), and the dominant model (OR = 2.2, p = 0.001) of rs12255372 gave a higher risk for T2DM. The carriers of CT genotype of rs290487 showed a significantly increased risk for T2DM (OR = 2.24, p = 0.003). Similarly, the dominant model of this SNP was found to be significantly associated with T2DM (OR = 2.25, p = 0.002). The control subjects carrying the T-allele of rs7903146 had higher levels of total cholesterol (CC; 4.52 +/- 1.03 vs. CT + TT; 5.00 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, p = 0.009) than those with CC genotype. Normoglycemic subjects carrying GT + TT genotypes of rs12255372 had a significantly higher WHR (GG; 0.90 +/- 0.059 vs. GT + TT; 0.93 +/- 0.07, p = 0.038) as compared with those with the GG genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The T-allele of rs12255372, rs7903146, and rs290487 polymorphisms of TCF7L2 confer susceptibility to T2DM in the Kurdish population of Iran.

25185853|t|TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy association is not independent of type 2 diabetes--a study in a south Indian population and meta-analysis.
25185853|a|Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a chronic microangiopathic complication of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The TCF7L2 gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. We aimed to investigate the impact of TCF7L2 gene on the susceptibility of T2DM and DN in a south Indian population. Plus to evaluate the association of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene with T2DM in the Indian population. The subjects recruited for this included 55 diabetic cases with diabetic nephropathy, 68 diabetic cases without nephropathy, and 82 non-diabetic healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood and genotyping of TCF7L2 rs7903146 was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. A literature survey was carried out into the effect of rs7903146 on genetic susceptibility to T2DM in Indian populations and we then performed a meta-analysis in order to evaluate its association with T2DM. Analysis of TCF7L2 rs7903146 in normal controls and diabetics with or without nephropathy demonstrated that the 'T' allele is associated with both diabetes (p = 0.049) and DN (p = 0.024), but this association is not independent of T2DM. Meta-analysis showed that the mutant allele and genotypes are associated with T2DM in Indian populations. In summary, a significant association exists between the 'T' allele and DN, but this association is not independent of T2DM. Pooled meta-analysis of studies on rs7903146 and T2DM confirmed that rs7903146 is significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in Indian populations.

25186316|t|Dorothy Hodgkin Lecture 2014. Understanding genes identified by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes.
25186316|a|Whilst the heritable nature of Type 2 diabetes has been recognized for many years, only in the past two decades have linkage analyses in families and genome-wide association studies in large populations begun to reveal the genetic landscape of the disease in detail. Whilst the former have provided a powerful means of identifying the genes responsible for monogenic forms of the disease, the latter highlight relatively large genomic regions. These often harbour multiple genes, whose relative contribution to exaggerated disease risk is uncertain. In the present study, the approaches that have been used to dissect the role of just a few (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, ADCY5, MTNR1B and CDKAL1) of the ~  500 genes identified at dozens of implicated loci are described. These are usually selected based on the strength of their effect on disease risk, and predictions as to their likely biological role. Direct determination of the effects of identified polymorphisms on gene expression in disease-relevant tissues, notably the pancreatic islet, are then performed to identify genes whose expression is affected by a particular polymorphism. Subsequent functional analyses then involve perturbing gene expression in vitro in b-cell lines or isolated islets and in vivo in animal models. Although the majority of polymorphisms affect insulin production rather than action, and mainly affect the b cell, effects via other tissues may also contribute, requiring careful consideration in the design and interpretation of experiments in model systems. These considerations illustrate the scale of the task needed to exploit genome-wide association study data for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

25189437|t|Overlap of genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
25189437|a|Despite the notion that there is a degree of commonality to the biological etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), the lack of overlap in the genetic factors underpinning each of them suggests very distinct mechanisms. A disorder considered to be at the "intersection" of these two diseases is "latent autoimmune diabetes in adults" (LADA). Interestingly, genetic signals from both T1D and T2D are also seen in LADA, including the key HLA and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) loci, but the magnitudes of these effects are more complex than just pointing to LADA as being a simple admixture of T1D and T2D. We review the current status of the understanding of the genetics of LADA and place it in the context of what is known about the genetics of its better-studied "cousins," T1D and T2D, especially with respect to the myriad of discoveries made over the last decade through genome-wide association studies.

25224167|t|Weight loss independent association of TCF7 L2 gene polymorphism with fasting blood glucose after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in type 2 diabetic patients.
25224167|a|BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery improves glucose control in most but not all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM). Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7 L2) gene variation (rs7903146, C: wild-type allele, T: risk-allele) is the strongest contributor to T2 DM risk. Until now, there are no studies investigating gene interactions with changes of glycemia in obese patients with T2 DM after RYGB. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of TCF7 L2 genotype on RYGB-induced changes in glucose homeostasis in 99 obese patients with T2 DM at 1-year follow-up. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were measured before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RYGB. Genotyping was performed with TaqMan technology. The effect of the interaction between TCF7 L2 genotype and postoperative time on BMI and FBG changes was analyzed with a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Preoperatively, there was no difference in BMI, FBG, and other diabetes associated traits between homozygous (CC) (n = 49) and heterozygous (CT) or homozygous (TT) T risk-allele carriers (n = 50). One year after RYGB, 48 out of 99 patients had glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1 c) lower than 6.5% in absence of any antidiabetic medication. BMI decreased similarly in both groups (P = .769, genotype-time interaction), however, the decrease in FBG over time was lower in T risk-allele carriers (P = .016, genotype-time interaction). At 1 year, FBG was 6.42    2.98 mmol/L in CT/TT versus 5.36    0.98 mmol/L in CC (P = .022, t test). CONCLUSION: TCF7 L2 gene variation affected the decrease of FBG after RYGB in obese patients with T2 DM, independently of weight loss.

25273842|t|A comparison of type 2 diabetes risk allele load between African Americans and European Americans.
25273842|a|The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is greater in populations of African descent compared to European-descent populations. Genetic risk factors may underlie the disparity in disease prevalence. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified  >60 common genetic variants that contribute to T2D risk in populations of European, Asian, African and Hispanic descent. These studies have not comprehensively examined population differences in cumulative risk allele load. To investigate the relationship between risk allele load and T2D risk, 46 T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 43 loci from GWAS in European, Asian, and African-derived populations were genotyped in 1,990 African Americans (n  =  963 T2D cases, n  =  1,027 controls) and 1,644 European Americans (n  =  719 T2D cases, n  =  925 controls) ascertained and recruited using a common protocol in the southeast United States. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed from the cumulative risk alleles for each individual. In African American subjects, risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.024 to 0.964. Risk alleles from 26 SNPs demonstrated directional consistency with previous studies, and 3 SNPs from ADAMTS9, TCF7L2, and ZFAND6 showed nominal evidence of association (p  <  0.05). African American individuals carried 38-67 (53.7      4.0, mean      SD) risk alleles. In European American subjects, risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.084 to 0.996. Risk alleles from 36 SNPs demonstrated directional consistency, and 10 SNPs from BCL11A, PSMD6, ADAMTS9, ZFAND3, ANK1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, PRC1, FTO, and BCAR1 showed evidence of association (p  <  0.05). European American individuals carried 38-65 (50.9      4.4) risk alleles. African Americans have a significantly greater burden of 2.8 risk alleles (p  =  3.97     10(-89)) compared to European Americans. However, GRS modeling showed that cumulative risk allele load was associated with risk of T2D in European Americans, but only marginally in African Americans. This result suggests that there are ethnic-specific differences in genetic architecture underlying T2D, and that these differences complicate our understanding of how risk allele load impacts disease susceptibility.

25274455|t|The gene polymorphisms of UCP1 but not PPAR y and TCF7L2 are associated with diabetic retinopathy in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus cases.
25274455|a|PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the association between the polymorphisms in three insulin resistance-related genes, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (PPARy) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and the susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cohort. METHODS: A total of 792 patients with T2DM were enrolled and categorized into two groups: (1) the DR group consisted of 448 patients, which was further subclassified into a proliferative DR (PDR) group with 220 patients and a non-proliferative DR (NPDR) group with 228 patients; (2) the diabetes without retinopathy (DNR) group, comprised 344 patients who had no signs of DR. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1800592 in the UCP1 gene, rs1801282, rs3856806 and rs1249719 in the PPARy gene and rs11196205 in the TCF7L2 gene were genotyped in this study. RESULTS: For SNP rs1800592 of the UCP1 gene, the frequency of allele G and genotype GG was significantly higher in the PDR group than in the DNR group (allele OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68, p  =  0.03; genotype OR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.06-2.79, p  =  0.03). No evident association was found between the allele frequencies and genotype distributions of any individual SNP in the PPARy or TCF7L2 genes and DR, PDR or NPDR. Haplotype analyses of the PPARy gene did not provide any evidence for an association with DR, PDR or NPDR in this Chinese T2DM cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the SNP rs1800592 in the UCP1 gene is associated with increased risk of PDR in the Chinese T2DM population.

25299103|t|Association of the rs7903146 and rs12255372 polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene with type 2 diabetes in a population from northeastern Brazil.
25299103|a|Approximately 200 million people suffer from type 2 diabetes (T2D) worldwide, and the rapid increase in the prevalence of this disease is likely a result of multiple environmental factors, such as increased food intake and decreased physical activity in genetically predisposed individuals. Different population studies have demonstrated a strong association of two polymorphic variations in the TCF7L2 gene, the noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146 (C/T) and rs12255372 (G/T), with T2D. Herein, we analyzed the association of these SNPs with T2D in a population from northeastern Brazil. Our results showed that the genotype and allele frequencies in TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs12255372 were similar in the patient and control groups (P > 0.05). In addition, the allele frequencies were not significantly associated with T2D risk [rs7903146: odds ratio (OR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.52-1.76, P = 1.00, and rs12255372: OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 0.72-2.62, P = 0.41]. These data suggest that the TCF7L2 SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 may not significantly contribute to T2D susceptibility in this population. However, our results may reflect the small number of subjects. Alternatively, these results may be attributable to specific ethnic effects, as most of the previously reported associations were demonstrated with predominantly European populations. To reach a definitive conclusion on the role of such gene variants for T2D in mixed populations, additional efforts are necessary to replicate this study with larger populations from areas with more ethnic heterogeneity.

25354859|t|[Correlation between TCF7L2 gene polymorphism and genetic susceptibility in women with gestational diabetes mellitus].
25354859|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) at locus rs7903146, rs290487, rsl1196205, rs12255372 and genetic susceptibility in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: As a case- control study, 100 pregnant women with GDM and 100 healthy pregnant women in the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Jiangxi Province were recruited from January 2010 to July 2013. Clinical parameters, including body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin (FINS), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were measured after admission to hospital. Allelespecific PCR was used to analyze the SNP of TCF7L2 at locus rs7903146, rs290487, rs11196205, rs12255372. RESULTS: (1)The BMI, FPG, FINS and HOMA-IR in GDM group were (27.4  3.0)kg/m(2), (5.6  1.0)mmol/L, (6.2  3.4) mU/L and 1.8  1.0, and were (24.2  2.9) kg/m(2), (5.3  0.8) mmol/L, (4.5  2.8) mU/L, 1.2  0.8 in the control group, respectively. The differences had statistically significance (P < 0.05). (2)The SNP of TCF7L2 gene, locus rs7903146 were CC, CT and TT genotype; the SNP of locus rs290487 were CC, CT and TT genotype; and the SNP of locus rs11196205 were GG and CC genotype; while the SNP of locus rs12255372 was GG genotype. (3)The distribution frequencies of genotype CC, CT and TT at locus rs7903146 in the GDM group were 40% (40/100), 36% (36/100) and 24% (24/100), respectively. While in the control group, they were 55% (55/100), 38% (38/100) and 7% (7/100), respectively. The frequencies of C and T allele of rs7903146 were 58%and 42%in the GDM group, and in the control group they were 74% (148/200) and 26% (52/200). The differences of genotype distribution and C/T allele frequency of rs7903146 between the two groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). (4)The distribution frequencies of genotype CC, CT and TT at locus rs290487 in the GDM group were 12% (12/100), 36% (36/ 100) and 52% (52/100), and were 16% (16/100), 34% (34/100)and 50% (50/100)in the control group. The frequencies of C and T allele of rs290487 were 30% (60/200)and 70% (140/200)in the GDM group, and were 33% (66/200)and 67% (134/200)in the control group. There was no difference of genotype distribution and C/T allele frequency of rs290487 between the two groups (P > 0.05). (5)The distribution frequencies of genotype GG and CC at locus rs11196205 in the GDM group were 99% (99/100)and 1% (1/100), while those in the control group were 100% (100/100)and 0%. The frequency of G and C allele of rs11196205 were 99% (198/200) and 1% (2/200) in the GDM group, while in the control group were 100% (200/200) and 0. There was no difference of genotype distribution and G/C allele frequency of rs11196205 between the two groups (P > 0.05). (6)The distribution frequencies of genotype GG at locus rs12255372 were 100% (100/100)in both the GDM group and the control group. The frequencies of G allele of rs12255372 were 100% (200/200) in both the GDM group and the control group. There was no difference of genotype distribution and G allele frequency of rs12255372 between the two groups (P > 0.05). (7)After adjusting for age, gestational age, BMI, FPG and FINS, pregnant women with TT genotype at locus rs7903146 were more likely to have hyperglycemia compared with the C allele carriers (OR = 2.77, 95%CI: 1.03-7.57, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of locus rs7903146 in TCF7L2 gene may be associated with genetic susceptibility in women with GDM. TT genotype is likely to be risk factor in the pathogenesis of GDM.

25355422|t|Selective disruption of Tcf7l2 in the pancreatic b cell impairs secretory function and lowers b cell mass.
25355422|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by b cell dysfunction and loss. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the T-cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, associated with T2D by genome-wide association studies, lead to impaired b cell function. While deletion of the homologous murine Tcf7l2 gene throughout the developing pancreas leads to impaired glucose tolerance, deletion in the b cell in adult mice reportedly has more modest effects. To inactivate Tcf7l2 highly selectively in b cells from the earliest expression of the Ins1 gene (   E11.5) we have therefore used a Cre recombinase introduced at the Ins1 locus. Tcfl2(fl/fl)::Ins1Cre mice display impaired oral and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance by 8 and 16 weeks, respectively, and defective responses to the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide at 8 weeks. Tcfl2(fl/fl)::Ins1Cre islets displayed defective glucose- and GLP-1-stimulated insulin secretion and the expression of both the Ins2 (   20%) and Glp1r (   40%) genes were significantly reduced. Glucose- and GLP-1-induced intracellular free Ca(2+) increases, and connectivity between individual b cells, were both lowered by Tcf7l2 deletion in islets from mice maintained on a high (60%) fat diet. Finally, analysis by optical projection tomography revealed    30% decrease in b cell mass in pancreata from Tcfl2(fl/fl)::Ins1Cre mice. These data demonstrate that Tcf7l2 plays a cell autonomous role in the control of b cell function and mass, serving as an important regulator of gene expression and islet cell coordination. The possible relevance of these findings for the action of TCF7L2 polymorphisms associated with Type 2 diabetes in man is discussed.

25393876|t|Identification of allelic heterogeneity at type-2 diabetes loci and impact on prediction.
25393876|a|Although over 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified by meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for type-2 diabetes (T2D) among individuals of European descent, much of the genetic variation remains unexplained. There are likely many more SNPs that contribute to variation in T2D risk, some of which may lie in the regions surrounding established SNPs--a phenomenon often referred to as allelic heterogeneity. Here, we use the summary statistics from the DIAGRAM consortium meta-analysis of T2D genome-wide association studies along with linkage disequilibrium patterns inferred from a large reference sample to identify novel SNPs associated with T2D surrounding each of the previously established risk loci. We then examine the extent to which the use of these additional SNPs improves prediction of T2D risk in an independent validation dataset. Our results suggest that multiple SNPs at each of 3 loci contribute to T2D susceptibility (TCF7L2, CDKN2A/B, and KCNQ1; p<5*10(-8)). Using a less stringent threshold (p<5*10(-4)), we identify 34 additional loci with multiple associated SNPs. The addition of these SNPs slightly improves T2D prediction compared to the use of only the respective lead SNPs, when assessed using an independent validation cohort. Our findings suggest that some currently established T2D risk loci likely harbor multiple polymorphisms which contribute independently and collectively to T2D risk. This opens a promising avenue for improving prediction of T2D, and for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of T2D.

25398947|t|Evidence of non-pancreatic beta cell-dependent roles of Tcf7l2 in the regulation of glucose metabolism in mice.
25398947|a|Non-coding variation within TCF7L2 remains the strongest genetic determinant of type 2 diabetes risk in humans. A considerable effort has been placed in understanding the functional roles of TCF7L2 in pancreatic beta cells, despite evidence of TCF7L2 expression in various peripheral tissues important in glucose homeostasis. Here, we use a humanized mouse model overexpressing Tcf7l2, resulting in glucose intolerance, to infer the contribution of Tcf7l2 overexpression in beta cells and in other tissues to the metabolic phenotypes displayed by these mice. Restoring Tcf7l2 expression specifically in beta cells to endogenous levels, in face of its overexpression elsewhere, results in impaired insulin secretion, reduced beta cell number and islet area, corroborating data obtained in humans showing similar phenotypes as a result of manipulations leading to Tcf7l2 loss of function. Interestingly, the persistent overexpression of Tcf7l2 in non-pancreatic tissues results in a significant worsening in glucose tolerance in vivo, indicating that Tcf7l2 overexpression in beta cells does not account for the glucose intolerance in the Tcf7l2 overexpression mouse model. Collectively, these data posit that Tcf7l2 plays key roles in glucose metabolism through actions beyond pancreatic beta cells, and further points to functionally opposing cell-type specific effects for Tcf7l2 on the maintenance of balanced glucose metabolism, thereby urging a careful examination of its role in non-pancreatic tissues as well as its composite metabolic effects across distinct tissues. Uncovering these roles may lead to new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.

25414334|t|The mechanisms of genome-wide target gene regulation by TCF7L2 in liver cells.
25414334|a|In the liver Wnt-signaling contributes to the metabolic fate of hepatocytes, but the precise role of the TCF7L2 in this process is unknown. We employed a temporal RNA-Seq approach to examine gene expression 3-96 h following Tcf7l2 silencing in rat hepatoma cells, and combined this with ChIP-Seq to investigate mechanisms of target gene regulation by TCF7L2. Silencing Tcf7l2 led to a time-dependent appearance of 406 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including key regulators of cellular growth and differentiation, and amino acid, lipid and glucose metabolism. Direct regulation of 149 DEGs was suggested by strong proximal TCF7L2 binding (peak proximity score > 10) and early mRNA expression changes ( <=18 h). Indirect gene regulation by TCF7L2 likely occurred via alternate transcription factors, including Hnf4a, Foxo1, Cited2, Myc and Lef1, which were differentially expressed following Tcf7l2 knock-down. Tcf7l2-silencing enhanced the expression and chromatin occupancy of HNF4a, and co-siRNA experiments revealed that HNF4a was required for the regulation of a subset of metabolic genes by TCF7L2, particularly those involved in lipid and amino-acid metabolism. Our findings suggest TCF7L2 is an important regulator of the hepatic phenotype, and highlight novel mechanisms of gene regulation by TCF7L2 that involve interplay between multiple hepatic transcriptional pathways.

25452857|t|Association of TCF7L2 variation with single islet autoantibody expression in children with type 1 diabetes.
25452857|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has the strongest genetic association with type 2 diabetes. TCF7L2 also associates with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which often presents with a single islet autoantibody, but not with classical type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We aimed to test if TCF7L2 is associated with single islet autoantibody expression in pediatric type 1 diabetes. We studied 71 prospectively recruited children who had newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and evidence of islet autoimmunity, that is, expressed >= 1 islet autoantibody to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell autoantigen 512, or zinc transporter 8. TCF7L2 rs7903146 alleles were identified. Data at diagnosis were cross-sectionally analyzed. RESULTS: We found that 21.1% of the children with autoimmune type 1 diabetes expressed a single islet autoantibody. The distribution of TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes in children with a single autoantibody (n=15) was 40% CC, 26.7% CT and 33.3% TT, compared with children with >= 2 islet autoantibodies (50% CC, 42.9% CT and 7.1% TT, p=0.024). Furthermore, compared with children with >= 2 autoantibodies, single-autoantibody children had characteristics reflecting milder autoimmune destruction of b-cells. Restricting to lean children (body mass index<85th centile; n=36), 45.5% of those expressing a single autoantibody were rs7903146 TT homozygotes, compared with 0% of those with >= 2 autoantibodies (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in children with only mild islet autoimmunity, mechanisms associated with TCF7L2 genetic variation contribute to diabetogenesis, and this contribution is larger in the absence of obesity.

25469308|t|Two novel type 2 diabetes loci revealed through integration of TCF7L2 DNA occupancy and SNP association data.
25469308|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) locus is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously mapped the genomic regions bound by TCF7L2 using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq in the colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116, revealing an unexpected highly significant over-representation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci associated primarily with endocrine (in particular T2D) and cardiovascular traits. METHODS: In order to further explore if this observed phenomenon occurs in other cell lines, we carried out ChIP-seq in HepG2 cells and leveraged ENCODE data for five additional cell lines. Given that only a minority of the predicted genetic component to most complex traits has been identified to date, plus our GWAS-related observations with respect to TCF7L2 occupancy, we investigated if restricting association analyses to the genes yielded from this approach, in order to reduce the constraints of multiple testing, could reveal novel T2D loci. RESULTS: We found strong evidence for the continued enrichment of endocrine and cardiovascular GWAS categories, with additional support for cancer. When investigating all the known GWAS loci bound by TCF7L2 in the shortest gene list, derived from HCT116, the coronary artery disease-associated variant, rs46522 at the UBE2Z-GIP-ATP5G1-SNF8 locus, yielded significant association with T2D within DIAGRAM. Furthermore, when we analyzed tag-SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in genes not previously implicated by GWAS but bound by TCF7L2 within 5   kb, we observed a significant association of rs4780476 within CPPED1 in DIAGRAM. CONCLUSIONS: ChIP-seq data generated with this GWAS-implicated transcription factor provided a biologically plausible method to limit multiple testing in the assessment of genome-wide genotyping data to uncover two novel T2D-associated loci.

25483131|t|T2DM GWAS in the Lebanese population confirms the role of TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 in disease susceptibility.
25483131|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of multiple populations with distinctive genetic and lifestyle backgrounds are crucial to the understanding of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) pathophysiology. We report a GWAS on the genetic basis of T2DM in a 3,286 Lebanese participants. More than 5,000,000   SNPs were directly genotyped or imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panels. We identify genome-wide significant variants in two loci CDKAL1 and TCF7L2, independent of sex, age and BMI, with leading variants rs7766070 (OR = 1.39, P = 4.77 * 10(-9)) and rs34872471 (OR = 1.35, P = 1.01 * 10(-8)) respectively. The current study is the first GWAS to find genomic regions implicated in T2DM in the Lebanese population. The results support a central role of CDKAL1 and TCF7L2 in T2DM susceptibility in Southwest Asian populations and provide a plausible component for understanding molecular mechanisms involved in the disease.

25491720|t|The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, dietary intakes and type 2 diabetes risk in an Algerian population.
25491720|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is the most significant genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Association analyses were performed on participants (n   =   751, aged between 30 and 64) in the ISOR population-based study in the city of Oran. Dietary intakes were estimated using a weekly food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The T allele of the rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with lower body weight (p   =   0.02), lower BMI (p   =   0.009), lower waist circumference (p   =   0.01) and a lower waist-to-hip ratio (p   =   0.02). The T allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of T2D (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval)   =   1.55 (1.09-2.20), p   =   0.01) and this association was independent of BMI. When considering the T2D risk, there were nominal interactions between the rs7903146 SNP and dessert (p   =   0.05) and milk intakes (p   =   0.01). The T2D risk was greater in T allele carriers with high dessert and milk intakes (OR   =   2.61 (1.51-4.52), p   =   0.0006, and 2.46 (1.47-4.12), p   =   0.0006, respectively). In subjects with a high dessert intake, the T allele was also associated with higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations (4.89        0.46  mmol/L in TT subjects, 4.72        0.48  mmol/L in CT subjects and 4.78        0.51  mmol/L in CC subjects; p   =   0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The T allele of the rs7903146 SNP is associated with a significantly higher risk of T2D in an Algerian population. This association was further strengthened by a high dessert intake, suggesting that gene-diet interactions increase the T2D risk.

25498973|t|The type 2 diabetes associated rs7903146 T allele within TCF7L2 is significantly under-represented in Hereditary Multiple Exostoses: insights into pathogenesis.
25498973|a|Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by benign cartilage tumors (exostoses) forming near the growth plates, leading to severe health problems. EXT1 and EXT2 are the two genes known to harbor heterozygous loss-of-function mutations that account for the vast majority of the primary genetic component of HME. However, patients present with wide clinical heterogeneity, suggesting that modifier genes play a role in determining severity. Our previous work has pointed to an imbalance of b-catenin signaling being involved in the pathogenesis of osteochondroma formation. TCF7L2 is one of the key 'gate-keeper' TCF family members for Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, and TCF7L2 and EXT2 are among the earliest associated loci reported in genome wide appraisals of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thus we investigated if the key T allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 within the TCF7L2 locus, which is strongly over-represented among T2D cases, was also associated with HME. We leveraged genotype data available from ongoing GWAS efforts from genomics and orthopedic centers in the US, Canada and Italy. Collectively 213 cases and 1890 controls were analyzed and, surprisingly, the T allele was in fact significantly under-represented in the HME patient group [P = 0.009; odds ratio = 0.737 (95% C.I. 0.587-0.926)]; in addition, the direction of effect was consistent within each individual cohort. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that TCF7L2 is differentially expressed and distributed in normal human growth plate zones, and exhibits substantial variability in human exostoses in terms of staining intensity and distribution. In summary, the data indicate that there is a putative genetic connection between TCF7L2 and EXT in the context of HME. Given this observation, we suggest that these loci could possibly modulate shared pathways, in particular with respect to b-catenin, and their respective variants interplay to influence HME pathogenesis as well as T2D.

25516658|t|Case-control study of diabetes-related genetic variants and pancreatic cancer risk in Japan.
25516658|a|AIM: To examine whether diabetes-related genetic variants are associated with pancreatic cancer risk. METHODS: We genotyped 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PPARG2 (rs1801282), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), ADRB3 (rs4994), KCNQ1 (rs2237895), KCNJ11 (rs5219), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), and CDKAL1 (rs2206734), and examined their associations with pancreatic cancer risk in a multi-institute case-control study including 360 cases and 400 controls in Japan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect detailed information on lifestyle factors. Genotyping was performed using Fluidigm SNPtype assays. Unconditional logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between these diabetes-associated variants and pancreatic cancer risk. RESULTS: With the exception of rs1501299 in the ADIPOQ gene (P = 0.09), no apparent differences in genotype frequencies were observed between cases and controls. Rs1501299 in the ADPIOQ gene was positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk; compared with individuals with the AA genotype, the age- and sex-adjusted OR was 1.79 (95%CI: 0.98-3.25) among those with the AC genotype and 1.86 (95%CI: 1.03-3.38) among those with the CC genotype. The ORs remained similar after additional adjustment for body mass index and cigarette smoking. In contrast, rs2237895 in the KCNQ1 gene was inversely related to pancreatic cancer risk, with a multivariable-adjusted OR of 0.62 (0.37-1.04) among individuals with the CC genotype compared with the AA genotype. No significant associations were noted for other 5 SNPs. CONCLUSION: Our case-control study indicates that rs1501299 in the ADIPOQ gene may be associated with pancreatic cancer risk. These findings should be replicated in additional studies.

25550093|t|Acute Wnt pathway activation positively regulates leptin gene expression in mature adipocytes.
25550093|a|UNASSIGNED: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed the implication of several Wnt signaling pathway components, including its effector transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) in diabetes and other metabolic disorders. As TCF7L2 is expressed in adipocytes, we investigated its expression and function in rodent fat tissue and mature adipocytes. We found that TCF7L2 mRNA expression in C57BL/6 mouse epididymal fat tissue was up-regulated by feeding but down-regulated by intraperitoneal insulin injection. In high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice, db/db mice and Zucker (fa/fa) rats, epididymal fat TCF7L2 mRNA levels were lower than the corresponding controls. Treating rat adipocytes with 100nM insulin repressed TCF7L2 mRNA and protein levels, associated with the repression of leptin mRNA level. The treatment with 1nM insulin, however, stimulated TCF7L2 and leptin mRNA levels. This stimulation could be attenuated by iCRT14, an inhibitor of b-catenin/TCF-responsive transcription. Wnt3a stimulated leptin mRNA level, which was also blocked by iCRT14 co-treatment. Utilizing the leptin-expressing cell line HTR8 as a tool, we defined an evolutionarily conserved CREB binding motif that mediated Wnt3a activation. Although Wnt activation is known to repress the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells towards mature adipocytes, short-term Wnt3a treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells stimulated leptin mRNA levels. Thus, wnt pathway plays a dual function in adipocytes, including the well-known repressive effect on adipogenesis and the stimulation of leptin production in mature adipocytes in response to nutritional status.

25565211|t|Mouse-human experimental epigenetic analysis unmasks dietary targets and genetic liability for diabetic phenotypes.
25565211|a|Using a functional approach to investigate the epigenetics of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we combine three lines of evidence-diet-induced epigenetic dysregulation in mouse, epigenetic conservation in humans, and T2D clinical risk evidence-to identify genes implicated in T2D pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity. Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. We then replicate these results in adipose samples from lean and obese patients pre- and post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, identifying regions where both the location and direction of methylation change are conserved. These regions overlap with 27 genetic T2D risk loci, only one of which was deemed significant by GWAS alone. Functional analysis of genes associated with these regions revealed four genes with roles in insulin resistance, demonstrating the potential general utility of this approach for complementing conventional human genetic studies by integrating cross-species epigenomics and clinical genetic risk.

25576056|t|Liver-specific Expression of Dominant Negative Transcription Factor 7-like 2 Causes Progressive Impairment in Glucose Homeostasis.
25576056|a|UNASSIGNED: Investigations on the metabolic role of the Wnt signaling pathway and hepatic TCF7L2 have generated opposing views. While some studies demonstrated a repressive effect of TCF7L2 on hepatic gluconeogenesis, a recent study using liver-specific Tcf7l2(-/-) mice suggested the opposite. As a consequence of redundant and bidirectional actions of TCF molecules and other complexities of the Wnt pathway, knockout of a single Wnt pathway component may not effectively reveal a complete metabolic picture of this pathway. To address this, we generated the liver-specific dominant negative TCF7L2 (TCF7L2DN) transgenic mouse model LTCFDN. These mice exhibited progressive impairment in response to pyruvate challenge. Importantly, LTCFDN hepatocytes displayed elevated gluconeogenic gene expression, gluconeogenesis, and loss of Wnt-3a-mediated repression of gluconeogenesis. In C57BL/6 hepatocytes, adenovirus-mediated expression of TCF7L2DN, but not wild-type TCF7L2, increased gluconeogenesis and gluconeogenic gene expression. Our further mechanistic exploration suggests that TCF7L2DN-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling causes preferential interaction of b-cat to FoxO1 and increased binding of b-cat/FoxO1 to the Pck1 FoxO binding site, resulting in the stimulation of Pck1 expression and increased gluconeogenesis. Together, our results using TCF7L2DN as a unique tool revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway and its effector b-cat/TCF serve a beneficial role in suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis.

25606417|t|Association of the rs11196218 polymorphism in TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian population.
25606417|a|OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association of rs11196218 polymorphism in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Asian population by a case-control study and meta-analysis. METHODS: In the case-control study, 1842 patients with T2DM and 7777 normal glucose-tolerant controls in the Henan province of China were genotyped for rs11196218 in TCF7L2 by PCR-ligase detection reaction. We used allele, co-dominant, dominant and recessive models to evaluate the risk association and performed a meta-analysis of the results of different genetic models in previous studies and the current study. RESULTS: The AG genotype of rs11196218 was associated with risk of T2DM in the Henan population (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.78), and dominant model showed marginal significant association (1.28, 0.99-1.67). Meta-analysis of 10 studies revealed the dominant model associated with T2DM in the overall population (1.20, 1.05-1.36). When stratified by region (southern and northern China and Japan), both the AG genotype and the dominant model were associated with risk of T2DM in southern Chinese (1.31, 1.03-1.66; 1.27, 1.01-1.60, respectively). CONCLUSION: The rs11196218 polymorphism in TCF7L2 is associated with risk of T2DM in Asian population.

25627047|a|Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene and type 2 diabetes mellitus, in a Southern-Brazilian population. Materials and methods The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism was genotyped in 953 type 2 diabetic patients and 535 non-diabetic subjects. All subjects were white. The polymorphism was genotyped by Real-Time PCR using TaqMan MGB probes (Life Technologies). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for additive, recessive and dominant inheritance models. Results Genotype and allele frequencies of the rs7903146 polymorphism differed significantly between type 2 diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects (P = 0.001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). The frequency of the minor allele was 38% in type 2 diabetes group and 31% in non-diabetic subjects, and this allele was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.15 - 1.76 for the dominant model of inheritance). Moreover, the T/T genotype was associated with a higher risk for type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.3-2.5) than the presence of only one copy of the T allele (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.1-1.6). Both results were adjusted for age and gender. Conclusions Our results confirm the association between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and increase risk for type 2 diabetes in Southern-Brazil.

25737773|t|Polymorphism of Transcription Factor-7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) Gene and New-Onset Diabetes after Liver Transplantation.
25737773|a|BACKGROUND: New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious complication in transplant recipients. Transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a Wnt signaling-associated transcription factor that plays an important role in b-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. The association between TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 and NODAT was documented in renal transplant patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 variants and the risk of NODAT after liver transplantation. METHODS: This study was conducted on 140 liver transplant recipients who had received tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive drugs. The patients were divided into NODAT (n=70) and non-NODAT (n=70) groups and were genotyped using PCR-RFLP. In addition, 100 normal subjects were considered as the comparison group. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the two study groups regarding donor and recipient age, recipient body mass index, and recipient fasting plasma glucose before the transplantation. No significant relationship was observed between TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotypes and development of NODAT. No significant difference was also found between the two groups in terms of the tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil daily dosage as well as tacrolimus blood level. However, the prednisolone daily dosage was significantly (p=0.01) higher in the NODAT group compared to those without NODAT. The majority of the patients in the NODAT group also had an episode of acute rejection. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between the transplant recipients and the comparison subjects regarding T allele (p<0.001, OR=1.96) and TT genotype (p<0.001, OR=3.47) frequencies. CONCLUSION: No correlation was found between TCF7L2 genotypes and development of NODAT. Acute rejection and prednisolone pulse therapy predisposed the susceptible patients to NODAT.

To identify loci associated with BMI and T2D we undertook a genome-wide association study using 1,075,436 quality-controlled single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped (Illumina 2.5M Duo Beadchip) in 402 individuals in extended pedigrees from a Western Australian Aboriginal community. Imputation using the thousand genomes (1000G) reference panel extended the analysis to 6,724,284 post quality-control autosomal SNPs. No associations achieved genome-wide significance, commonly accepted as P<5x10-8. Nevertheless, genes/pathways in common with other ethnicities were identified despite the arrival of Aboriginal people in Australia >45,000 years ago. The top hit (rs10868204 Pgenotyped = 1.50x10-6; rs11140653 Pimputed_1000G = 2.90x10-7) for BMI lies 5' of NTRK2, the type 2 neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). PIK3C2G (rs12816270 Pgenotyped = 8.06x10-6; rs10841048 Pimputed_1000G = 6.28x10-7) was associated with BMI, but not with T2D as reported elsewhere. BMI also associated with CNTNAP2 (rs6960319 Pgenotyped = 4.65x10-5; rs13225016 Pimputed_1000G = 6.57x10-5), previously identified as the strongest gene-by-environment interaction for BMI in African-Americans. The top hit (rs11240074 Pgenotyped = 5.59x10-6, Pimputed_1000G = 5.73x10-6) for T2D lies 5' of BCL9 that, along with TCF7L2, promotes beta-catenin's transcriptional activity in the WNT signaling pathway. Additional hits occurred in genes affecting pancreatic (KCNJ6, KCNA1) and/or GABA (GABRR1, KCNA1) functions. Notable associations observed for genes previously identified at genome-wide significance in other populations included MC4R (Pgenotyped = 4.49x10-4) for BMI and IGF2BP2 Pimputed_1000G = 2.55x10-6) for T2D. Our results may provide novel functional leads in understanding disease pathogenesis in this Australian Aboriginal population.

25789119|t|Association of gene variants with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes among Omanis.
25789119|a|AIM: To investigate the association of 10 known common gene variants with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) among Omanis. METHODS: Using case-control design, a total of 992 diabetic patients and 294 normoglycemic Omani Arabs were genotyped, by an allelic discrimination assay-by-design TaqMan method on fast real time polymerase chain reaction system, for the following gene variants: KCNJ11 (rs5219), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), CDKAL1 (rs10946398), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), FTO (rs9939609 and rs8050136), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), SLC30A8 (rs13266634) CAPN10 (rs3792267) and HHEX (rs1111875). T2D patients were recruited from the Diabetes Clinic (n = 243) and inpatients (n = 749) at Sultan Qaboos Univesity Hospital (SQUH), Muscat, Oman. Adult control participants (n = 294) were volunteers from the community and from those visiting Family Medicine Clinic at SQU, for regular medical checkup. The difficulty in recruiting Omani participants with no family history of diabetes was the main reason behind the small number of control participants in this study. Almost all volunteers questioned had a relative with diabetes mellitus. Inspite of the small number of normoglycemic controls in this study, this sample was sufficient for detection of genes and loci for common alleles influencing T2D with an odds ratio of >=  1.3 reaching at least 80% power. Data was collected from June 2010 to February 2012. RESULTS: Using binary logistic regression analysis, four gene variants showed significant association with T2D risk: KCNJ11 (rs5219, P = 5.8 * 10(-6), OR = 1.74), TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 0.001, OR = 1.46), CDKAL1 (rs10946398, P = 0.002, OR = 1.44) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 0.020, OR = 1.40). The fixation index analysis of these four gene variants indicated significant genetic differentiation between diabetics and controls {[KCNJ11 (rs5219), P < 0.001], [TCF7L2 (rs7903146), P < 0.001], [CDKAL1 (rs10946398), P < 0.05], [CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), P < 0.05]}. The highest genotype variation % between diabetics and controls was found at KCNJ11 (2.07%) and TCF7L2 (1.62%). This study was not able to detect an association of T2D risk with gene variants of IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), CAPN10 (rs3792267) and HHEX (rs1111875). Moreover, no association was found between FTO gene variants (rs9939609 and rs8050136) and T2D risk. However, T2D risk was found to be significantly associated with obesity (P = 0.002, OR = 2.22); and with the Waist-to-Hip ratio (n = 532, P = 1.9 *10(-7), OR = 2.4), [among males (n = 234, P = 1.2 * 10(-4), OR = 2.0) and females (n = 298, P = 0.001, OR = 6.3)]. CONCLUSION: Results confirmed the association of KCNJ11 (rs5219), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), CDKAL1 (rs10946398) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661) gene variants with susceptibility to T2D among Omani Arabs.

25812009|t|The study to understand the genetics of the acute response to metformin and glipizide in humans (SUGAR-MGH): design of a pharmacogenetic resource for type 2 diabetes.
25812009|a|OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have uncovered a large number of genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes or related phenotypes. In many cases the causal gene or polymorphism has not been identified, and its impact on response to anti-hyperglycemic medications is unknown. The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH, NCT01762046) is a novel resource of genetic and biochemical data following glipizide and metformin administration. We describe recruitment, enrollment, and phenotyping procedures and preliminary results for the first 668 of our planned 1,000 participants enriched for individuals at risk of requiring anti-diabetic therapy in the future. METHODS: All individuals are challenged with 5 mg glipizide * 1; twice daily 500 mg metformin * 2 days; and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test following metformin. Genetic variants associated with glycemic traits and blood glucose, insulin, and other hormones at baseline and following each intervention are measured. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of the cohort is female and 30% belong to an ethnic minority group. Following glipizide administration, peak insulin occurred at 60 minutes and trough glucose at 120 minutes. Thirty percent of participants experienced non-severe symptomatic hypoglycemia and required rescue with oral glucose. Following metformin administration, fasting glucose and insulin were reduced. Common genetic variants were associated with fasting glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: SUGAR-MGH represents a viable pharmacogenetic resource which, when completed, will serve to characterize genetic influences on pharmacological perturbations, and help establish the functional relevance of newly discovered genetic loci to therapy of type 2 diabetes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01762046.

25839936|a|UNASSIGNED: Association of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with common variants in HHEX, HNF4a, KCNJ11, PPARy, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, CDC123/CAMK1D, TCF7L2, ABCA1 and SLC16A11 genes have been reported, mainly in populations of European and Asian ancestry and to a lesser extent in Latin Americans. Thus, we aimed to investigate the contribution of rs1111875 (HHEX), rs1800961 (HNF4a), rs5219 (KCNJ11), rs1801282 (PPARy), rs10811661 (CDKN2A/2B), rs13266634 (SLC30A8), rs12779790 (CDC123/CAMK1D), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs9282541 (ABCA1) and rs13342692 (SLC16A11) polymorphisms in the genetic background of Maya population to associate their susceptibility to develop T2D. This is one of the first studies designed specifically to investigate the inherited component of T2D in the indigenous population of Mexico. SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination method in 575 unrelated Maya individuals. Two SNPs rs10811661 and rs928254 were significantly associated with T2D after adjusting for BMI; rs10811661 in a recessive and rs9282541 in a dominant model. Additionally, we found phenotypical alterations associated with genetic variants: HDL to rs9282541 and insulin to rs13342692. In conclusion, these findings support an association of genetic polymorphisms to develop T2D in Maya population.

26937418|t|Candidate gene analysis supports a role for polymorphisms at TCF7L2 as risk factors for type 2 diabetes in Sudan.
26937418|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is multifactorial. A growing number of genes have been identified as risk factors for T2D across multiple ethnicities in trans-ancestry meta-analysis of large-scale genome-wide association studies. Few studies have looked at these genes in Sub-Saharan African populations. This study was undertaken to look for associations between T2D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of the top candidate genes in a selected Sudanese population. METHODS: A total 240 T2D cases and 128 unrelated healthy control subjects were included in this study. Age, sex, weight and height were recorded, blood pressure and biochemical profiles of glucose and lipids were analysed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY   system. Fourteen SNPs were selected across 7 genes: CAPN10 (rs2975760 and rs5030952), PPARG (rs17036314 and rs1801282), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKAL1 (rs9465871), HHEX (rs1111875), TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372), and KCNJ11 (rs5215, rs1800467 and rs5219). Allelic and haplotype association analyses were performed under additive models in PLINK. P   <=    0.007 (=0.05/7 genes) was the P-value required to achieve correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: A significant genetic association between the SNPs rs7903146 (odds ratio 1.69, 95  % confidence interval 1.21-2.38, P   =   0.002) and rs12255372 (odds ratio 1.70, 95  % confidence interval 1.20-2.41, P   =   0.003) at TCF7L2 and T2D was found in Sudanese population. These associations were retained after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (e.g. rs7903146: odds ratio 1.70, P adj:age/sex/BMI   =   0.005). The strongest haplotype association (odds ratio 2.24; P adj:age/sex/BMI   =   0.0003) comprised the two point haplotype T_C across rs7903146 and rs11196205. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that SNP rs7903146 added significant main effects to rs11196205 or rs12255372, whereas the reverse was not true, indicating that the main effect for association with T2D in this population is most strongly tagged by SNP rs7903146. Adjusted analyses also provided support for protection from T2D associated with minor alleles at SNPs rs2975760 at CAPN10 (odds ratio 0.44, 95  % confidence interval 0.20-0.97, P adj:age/sex/BMI   =   0.042) and rs1111876 at HHEX (odds ratio 0.60, 95  % confidence interval 0.39- 0.93, P adj:age/sex/BMI   =   0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Multiethnic associations between T2D and SNPs at TCF7L2, CAPN10 and HHEX extend to Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Sudan.

25863010|t|Association of LRP5, TCF7L2, and GCG variants and type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as fasting plasma glucose and lipid metabolism indexes.
25863010|a|UNASSIGNED: Recent data puts WNT signaling pathway in a pivotal role in regulating pancreas development as well as islet function, insulin production and secretion. The key effectors in the WNT signaling pathway are low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), and downstream-regulated glucagon (GCG). Our previous studies suggest that the WNT signaling pathway plays a significant role in risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese population. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRP5, TCF7L2 and glucagon (GCG) and quantitative traits in a healthy population. We used tag SNP to screen candidate SNPs for LRP5 and GCG; for TCF7L2, used the confirmed SNP rs11196218. A total of 1842 patients with T2DM and 7777 healthy controls underwent genotyping for the SNPs. We found a significant association of rs3758644 in LRP5 and fasting plasma glucose (p=0.006), and rs11196218 in TCF7L2 and triglycerides level (p=0.004). Among the SNPs in LRP5, TCF7L2, and GCG analyzed, only rs3758644 of LRP5 and rs11196218 of TCF7L2 were significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides index, respectively, in a healthy population.

25897419|t|Contribution of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C/T) gene polymorphism to the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in Cameroon.
25897419|a|BACKGROUND: Data on the genetic variants for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in sub-Saharan African populations are very scarce. This study aimed to investigate the association of transcription factor 7-like (TCF7L2) with T2DM in a Cameroonian population and explore possible genotype-phenotype correlation. METHODS: This is a case-control study involving 37 T2DM patients and 37 non-diabetic volunteers of Cameroonian ethnicity aged 40  years old and above. We collected clinical and biological data to determine phenotypic traits. TCF7L2 was analyzed by genotyping for rs7903146 (C/T) using PCR-RFLP. Biochemical analyses were performed using a spectrophotometer with Chronolab kits. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS, PS and Quanto. RESULTS: TCF7L2 was associated with T2DM in this Cameroonian population (p   =   0.013 for alleles, and p   =   0.013 for genotypes). The risk allele was C (9.5% patients vs. 0% healthy controls, OR   =   16.56) and the protective allele was T (90.5% patients vs. 100.0% healthy controls, OR   =   0.06). The risk genotype was C/T (18.9% patients vs. 0% healthy controls, OR   =   18.44), while the protective genotype was T/T (81.1% patients vs. 100.0% healthy controls, OR   =   0.054). The statistical power was 99.99%. TCF7L2 was not preferentially associated with a specific disease phenotype. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM in this Cameroonian population. The association is not dependent on a specific T2DM phenotype. Clinical genetic testing for TCF7L2 can help to predict the occurrence of T2DM in Cameroon.

25934528|t|Polymorphism in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with impaired proinsulin conversion-A meta-analysis.
25934528|a|AIMS: Available evidence supports the emerging hypothesis that the T-Allele of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 may be associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion, but no consensus was available up to now. METHODS: A computer-based search of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and reference lists of relevant articles was carried out, and then 19 studies involving 15830 subjects were identified. The combined weighted mean difference (WMD) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by a fixed or random effect. RESULTS: In the overall analysis, the T-Allele was observed to be significantly associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion (up-regulate fasting proinsulin concentration WMD -0.40pM/L (95% CI -0.57 to -0.23); down-regulate fasting insulin concentration 3.86pM/L (95% CI 1.91 to 5.81)). Subgroup analyse stratified by subjects population characteristics and ethnicity were performed. The results indicated the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism was associated with the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion in various population characteristics study. With only a few of subjects in Asians and Africans were available, we failed to detect significant ethnic difference about TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and the risk of impaired proinsulin conversion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the T-Allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 is a significantly risk factor for impaired proinsulin conversion. Future research should gather more data about the effect of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism on Asians and Africans.

25940230|t|Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet: Insights from the PREDIMED Study.
25940230|a|UNASSIGNED: The PREDIMED (PREvenci  n con DIeta MEDiterr  nea) multicenter, randomized, primary prevention trial assessed the long-term effects of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on clinical events of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We randomized 7447 men and women at high CVD risk into three diets: MeDiet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), MeDiet supplemented with nuts, and control diet (advice on a low-fat diet). No energy restriction and no special intervention on physical activity were applied. We observed 288 CVD events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or CVD death) during a median time of 4.8 years; hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.91) for the MeDiet+EVOO and 0.70 (CI, 0.53-0.94) for the MeDiet+nuts compared to the control group. Respective hazard ratios for incident diabetes (273 cases) among 3541 non-diabetic participants were 0.60 (0.43-0.85) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) for MeDiet+EVOO and MeDiet+nuts, respectively versus control. Significant improvements in classical and emerging CVD risk factors also supported a favorable effect of both MeDiets on blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, lipoprotein particles, inflammation, oxidative stress, and carotid atherosclerosis. In nutrigenomic studies beneficial effects of the intervention with MedDiets showed interactions with several genetic variants (TCF7L2, APOA2, MLXIPL, LPL, FTO, M4CR, COX-2, GCKR and SERPINE1) with respect to intermediate and final phenotypes. Thus, the PREDIMED trial provided strong evidence that a vegetable-based MeDiet rich in unsaturated fat and polyphenols can be a sustainable and ideal model for CVD prevention.

25950476|t|Geniposide promotes beta-cell regeneration and survival through regulating b-catenin/TCF7L2 pathway.
25950476|a|UNASSIGNED: T-cell factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is an important transcription factor of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, which has critical roles in b-cell survival and regeneration. In preliminary screening assay, we found geniposide, a naturally occurring compound, was able to increase TCF7L2 mRNA level in Min6 cells. Here we aimed to investigate the role of geniposide in b-cell and underlying mechanism involved. Geniposide was found to promote b-cell survival by increasing b-cell proliferation and decreasing b-cell apoptosis in cultured mouse islets after challenge with diabetic stimuli. Geniposide protected b-cell through activating Wnt signaling, enhanced expressions of TCF7L2 and GLP-1R, activated AKT, inhibited GSK3b activity, and promoted b-catenin nuclear translocation. The protective effect of geniposide was remarkably suppressed by siRNAs against b-catenin, or by ICG001 (b-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription inhibitor). Moreover, geniposide promoted b-cell regeneration in vivo to normalize blood glucose in high-fat diet and db/db mice. Increased b-cell proliferation was observed in pancreatic sections of geniposide-treated diabetic mice. Most importantly, geniposide triggered small islet-like cell clusters formation as a result of b-cell neogenesis from ductal epithelium, which was well correlated with the increase in TCF7L2 expression. In exocrine cells isolated from mouse pancreas, geniposide could induce duct cell differentiation through upregulating TCF7L2 expression and activating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Taken together, we identified a novel role of geniposide in promoting b-cell survival and regeneration by mechanisms involving the activation of b-catenin/TCF7L2 signaling. Our finding highlights the potential value of geniposide as a possible treatment for type 2 diabetes.

25973943|t|Genetic Determinants for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Related Metabolic Traits in Mexican Women.
25973943|a|UNASSIGNED: Epidemiological and physiological similarities among Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) suggest that both diseases, share a common genetic background. T2D risk variants have been associated to GDM susceptibility. However, the genetic architecture of GDM is not yet completely understood. We analyzed 176 SNPs for 115 loci previously associated to T2D, GDM and body mass index (BMI), as well as a set of 118 Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs), in 750 pregnant Mexican women. Association with GDM was found for two of the most frequently replicated T2D loci: a TCF7L2 haplotype (CTTC: rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326; P=2.16x10-06; OR=2.95) and a KCNQ1 haplotype (TTT: rs2237892, rs163184, rs2237897; P=1.98x10-05; OR=0.55). In addition, we found two loci associated to glycemic traits: CENTD2 (60' OGTT glycemia: rs1552224, P=0.03727) and MTNR1B (HOMA B: rs1387153, P=0.05358). Remarkably, a major susceptibility SLC16A11 locus for T2D in Mexicans was not shown to play a role in GDM risk. The fact that two of the main T2D associated loci also contribute to the risk of developing GDM in Mexicans, confirm that both diseases share a common genetic background. However, lack of association with a Native American contribution T2D risk haplotype, SLC16A11, suggests that other genetic mechanisms may be in play for GDM.

25984427|t|Validation of the association of TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 gene polymorphisms with post-transplant diabetes mellitus in Asian Indian population.
25984427|a|The rs7903146 and rs13266634 polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 genes, respectively, have been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the association of these polymorphisms with post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). To study this linkage, we determined a distribution of allele and genotype frequencies in Asian Indians. 42 PTDM and 98 non-PTDM subjects were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was performed to detect for rs7903146 and rs13266634 polymorphisms. The clinical details and statistical analysis for PTDM and non-PTDM subjects were recorded. Our results observed higher frequencies of the minor alleles in rs7903146 and rs13266634 polymorphisms in the PTDM group compared to the non-PTDM subjects. The allele frequencies also found to be significantly associated with PTDM (rs7903146: T vs C: OR-2.6; (95%CI: 1.2-5.6); p = 0.01; rs13266634: T vs C: OR-2.0; (95%CI: 1.1-3.4); p = 0.01). These findings suggest that rs7903146 and rs13266634 polymorphisms are associated with PTDM in the Asian Indian population despite a relatively small study group.

25995831|t|Association between the TCF7L2 rs12255372 (G/T) gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Cameroonian population: a pilot study.
25995831|a|BACKGROUND: To study the relationship between the rs12255372 (G/T) polymorphism of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a Cameroonian population. METHODS: This case-control study included 60 T2DM patients and 60 healthy normoglycemic controls, all unrelated and of Cameroonian origin, aged above 40  years (range 40-87). The Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RFLP-PCR) was used for genotyping. RESULTS: The T allele frequency was significantly higher in the diabetic group (0.44) than in the control group (0.17). This allele was significantly associated to a greater risk of developing T2DM as compared to the G allele (OR   =   3.92, 95% CI 2.04 - 7.67, p   <   0.0001). The codominant (additive) model explained best the risk of developing the disease, as the TT genotype was significantly associated to T2DM when compared to the GG genotype (OR   =   4.45, 95% CI 1.64 - 12.83, p   =   0.0014). By logistic regression adjusted for age, this OR was 4.33 (95% CI: 1.57 - 11.92, p   =   0.005). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the rs12255372 (G/T) polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene is an important risk factor for T2DM in the Cameroonian population.

26042206|t|Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Hyderabad, India.
26042206|a|Fifteen SNPs from nine different genes were genotyped on 1379 individuals, 758 T2DM patients and 621 controls, from the city of Hyderabad, India, using Sequenom Massarray platform. These data were analyzed to examine the role of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the manifestation of T2DM. The multivariate analysis suggests that TCF7L2, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, HHEX and PPARG genes are significantly associated with T2DM, albeit only the first two of the above 5 were associated in the univariate analysis. Significant gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were also observed with reference to TCF7L2, CAPN10 and CDKAL1 genes, highlighting their importance in the pathophysiology of T2DM. In the analysis for cumulative effect of risk alleles, SLC30A8 steps in as significant contributor to the disease by its presence in all combinations of risk alleles. A striking difference between risk allele categories, 1-4 and 5-6, was evident in showing protective and susceptible roles, respectively, while the latter was characterized by the presence of TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 variants. Overall, these two genes TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 showed strong association with T2DM, either individually or in interaction with the other genes. However, we need further studies on gene-gene and gene-environment interactions among heterogeneous Indian populations to obtain unequivocal conclusions that are applicable for the Indian population as a whole.

26046964|t|Glucose Metabolism in High Risk Subjects for Type 2 Diabetes Carrying the rs7903146 TCF7L2 Gene Variant.
26046964|a|CONTEXT: The mechanisms responsible for contribution of variants in the gene TFC7L2 to the risk for Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains far from being completely understood, and available studies have generated non-univocal results. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the postprandial glucose metabolism in subjects at risk for T2DMcarrying the TCF7L2 risk allele. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 23 subjects carrying the risk-conferring TCF7L2 genotypes (11 TT and 12 CT at rs7901346) and 13 subjects with wild-type genotype (CC) underwent a standard mixed meal test (MMT) in combination with stable-isotope tracers Outcome: measurements: We have evaluated endogenous and exogenous glucose fluxes and hormonal responses. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, endogenous glucose production (EGP) and plasma glucose clearance were similar in the three groups, whereas plasma glucagon levels were lower in both CT/TT than in CC (64  20, 63  18 and 90  29 pg/ml, respectively; both P=0.01). In response to MMT, TT subjects had lower plasma glucose levels than CC (mean AUC: 6.1  3.9 vs. 7.1  12.0 mmol/l, p=0.04) and lower insulin secretion rate (mean AUC: 385  95 vs. 530  159 pmol/m(2)/min, p=0.02). Initial (0-60 min) rate of appearance (Ra) of oral glucose was lower in TT compared to CT/CC (AUC: 2.7  1.1 vs. 3.8  1.2   mol/kg/min, p=0.02) with no difference among the three groups in EGP. AUC0-60min forRa of exogenous glucose (Raex) was positively correlated with the plasma glucose AUC0-60min. Total Raex AUC0-120min was correlated with total AUC0-120min of plasma glucose (r=0.45, P<0.01). Plasma GLP-1 and GIP levels in response to MMT were not affected by genotype. CONCLUSIONS: In subjects at risk for T2DM, the TCF7L2 polymorphisms were associated with reduced Raex into systemic circulation causing reduced post-prandial blood glucose increase and, in turn, lower insulin secretion rate with no impairment in beta cell function. The reduced Raex is likely due to greater glucose retention in the splanchnic area.

26058934|t|Association of rs12255372 (TCF7L2) and D76N (PDX-1) Polymorphisms with Type 2 Diabetes in a Population Living in Northeast Iran.
26058934|a|The aim of this study was to investigate whether the rs12255372 (TCF7L2) and D76N (PDX-1) polymorphisms are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Mashhad, northeast Iran. A hundred twenty seven patients with T2DM and 71 non-diabetic controls in Mashhad were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and ARMS-PCR methods. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were confirmed by sequencing in some samples and allelic and genotypic frequencies were then analyzed in each group. The T-allele of the SNP rs12255372 of TCF7L2 (OR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.12-6.49, P = 0.027) and the A-allele of PDX-1 D76N (OR = 3.93, 95% CI = 1.60-7.68, P = 0.002) were significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM. The rs12255372 SNP of TCF7L2 and D76N of PDX-1 genes may confer susceptibility to T2DM in the population living in Mashhad.

26083111|t|Association of Canonical Wnt/b-Catenin Pathway and Type 2 Diabetes: Genetic Epidemiological Study in Han Chinese.
26083111|a|UNASSIGNED: We aimed to investigate the associations of polymorphisms in Canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway (WNT) signaling genes (including low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5 [LRP5] and transcription factor 7-like 2 [TCF7L2] gene) and the downstream gene glucagon (GCG) and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a Han Chinese population. We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for LRP5, TCF7L2 and GCG gene were genotyped in 1842 patients with T2DM and 7777 normal glucose-tolerant healthy subjects. We used multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and multiplicative logistic regression adjusting for sex, age, anthropometric measurements and lipid levels to investigate the gene-gene interactions for the risk of T2DM. Among the five SNPs in LRP5, the recessive model of rs7102273 and the haplotype GCTCC were associated with T2DM risk; the haplotype GCTTC was associated with decreased risk. For TCF7L2, the rs11196218 genotype GA and the haplotype CCG, TTG, TTA were associated with T2DM risk; whereas, the haplotype CTG and TCG were associated with decreased risk. Both MDR and multiplicative logistic regression revealed potential gene-gene interactions among LRP5, TCF7L2, and GCG associated with T2DM. The WNT signaling pathway may play a significant role in risk of T2DM in Han Chinese people.

26087292|t|Gene Expression Signature in Adipose Tissue of Acromegaly Patients.
26087292|a|UNASSIGNED: To study the effect of chronic excess growth hormone on adipose tissue, we performed RNA sequencing in adipose tissue biopsies from patients with acromegaly (n = 7) or non-functioning pituitary adenomas (n = 11). The patients underwent clinical and metabolic profiling including assessment of HOMA-IR. Explants of adipose tissue were assayed ex vivo for lipolysis and ceramide levels. Patients with acromegaly had higher glucose, higher insulin levels and higher HOMA-IR score. We observed several previously reported transcriptional changes (IGF1, IGFBP3, CISH, SOCS2) that are known to be induced by GH/IGF-1 in liver but are also induced in adipose tissue. We also identified several novel transcriptional changes, some of which may be important for GH/IGF responses (PTPN3 and PTPN4) and the effects of acromegaly on growth and proliferation. Several differentially expressed transcripts may be important in GH/IGF-1-induced metabolic changes. Specifically, induction of LPL, ABHD5, and NRIP1 can contribute to enhanced lipolysis and may explain the elevated adipose tissue lipolysis in acromegalic patients. Higher expression of TCF7L2 and the fatty acid desaturases FADS1, FADS2 and SCD could contribute to insulin resistance. Ceramides were not different between the two groups. In summary, we have identified the acromegaly gene expression signature in human adipose tissue. The significance of altered expression of specific transcripts will enhance our understanding of the metabolic and proliferative changes associated with acromegaly.

26102344|t|Polymorphisms in FTO and TCF7L2 genes of Euro-Brazilian women with gestational diabetes.
26102344|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene polymorphisms rs8050136C>A and rs9939609T>A, and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms rs12255372G>T and rs7903146C>T, in a sample group of pregnant Euro-Brazilian women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Subjects were classified as either healthy pregnant control (n=200) or GDM (n=200) according to the 2010 criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The polymorphisms were genotyped using fluorescent probes (TaqMan  ). RESULTS: All groups were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genotype and allele frequencies of the examined polymorphisms did not exhibit significant difference (P>0.05) between the groups. In the healthy and GDM pregnant women groups, the A-allele frequencies (95% CI) of FTO polymorphisms rs8050136 and rs9939609 were 39% (34-44%); 38% (33-43%) and 40% (35-45%); 41% (36-46%), respectively; and the T-allele frequencies of TCF7L2 polymorphisms rs12255372 and rs7903146 were 30% (26-35%), 32% (27-37%) and 29% (25-34%), 36% (31-41%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The examined polymorphisms were not associated with GDM in the Euro-Brazilian population studied.

26109524|t|Role of high-risk variants in the development of impaired glucose metabolism was modified by birth weight in Han Chinese.
26109524|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of common variants in the genes SLC30A8, KCNQ1, and TCF7L2 in the association between birth weight and increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Han Chinese. METHODS: Seven variants (SLC30A8-rs13266634 and rs2466293; KCNQ1-rs2237895 and rs2074196; and TCF7L2-rs11196218, rs7903146, and rs290487) were genotyped in 1181 individuals born in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1921 to 1954 by Taqman allelic discrimination assay. All the subjects were stratified by birth weight into groups of >= 3000 g and <3000 g. Associations of genetic variants with birth weight and with risk of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (together as impaired glucose metabolism) were analysed. RESULTS: After adjustment for sex, gestational weeks, parity, and maternal age, the G allele of KCNQ1-rs2074196 was associated with higher birth weight (p   =   0.032). KCNQ1-rs2074196, rs2234895, and TCF7L2-rs290487 were associated with increased risk of impaired glucose metabolism. However, the associations were modified by size at birth. The associations above were only found in subjects with birth weights greater than (or equal to) 3000 g. In subjects with birth weights less than 3000 g, impaired glucose metabolism was associated with variants SLC30A8-rs2466293 and TCF7L2-rs11196218. CONCLUSIONS: The role of common variants in susceptible genes in the development of impaired glucose metabolism was modified by birth weight in Han Chinese. This provides evidence that genetic variants influence birth weight and are involved in development of type 2 diabetes.

26155736|t|Association of TCF7L2 Polymorphism with Diabetic Nephropathy in the South Indian Population.
26155736|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene plays a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TCF7L2 rs12255372 (G/T)polymorphism with type 2 diabetic nephropathy in the South Indian population. A total of 2102 subjects, 927 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects, 598 type 2 diabetic subjects without nephropathy (DM), and 577 type 2 diabetic subjects with nephropathy (DN) were genotyped by MassARRAY. As compared to the NGT group, the odds ratio (adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, and systolic BP) computed for the GT/TT genotype taking the GG genotype as reference was found to be 2.02 (95% CI: 1.16-3.51, p = 0.013) for DN and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.36-2.78, p = 0.0002) for DM. The genotype frequency was not significantly different between the DM and DN groups. In conclusion, the rs12255372 polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes and DN but its association with DN is mediated through diabetes.

26201011|t|Design of an allele-specific PCR assay to genotype the rs12255372 SNP in a pilot study of association between common TCF7L2 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes in Venezuelans.
26201011|a|OBJECTIVE: The global burden of diabetes mellitus will impact strongly American countries in the coming decades. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a multifactorial disease and the basis for its genetic susceptibility remains not fully understood. Different population studies have demonstrated that variants of the TCF7L2 gene are strongly associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Moreover, institutions or countries with limited budget to conduct genetic research need cost effective methods for detecting DNA variants. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We standardized a rapid and simple allele-specific PCR method for genotyping the rs12255372 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a pilot study exploring the association of three TCF7L2 polymorphisms (rs7903146, rs12255372 and DG10S478) with T2DM in 70 patients and 73 controls from Venezuela. RESULTS: The performance of the designed allele-specific PCR reaction for rs12255372 genotyping was reliable and accurate. Patients carrying the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele (CT + TT genotypes) and heterozygous CT genotype had a significantly higher risk for T2DM (OR = 2.9 and 2.3, respectively). Although rs12255372 and DG10S478 risk alleles predominated in T2DM group no statistical significance was found. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel allele-specific PCR method for easier and rapid detection of rs12255372 polymorphism without the use of expensive instrumentation and reagents. Our study in a relatively small sample of the Venezuelan population replicated the association of the rs7903146 SNP with T2DM. Further studies with larger sample size and more biochemical data should be conducted to explore the genetic basis of T2DM susceptibility in Venezuela.

26247673|t|The association between the rs11196218A/G polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene and type 2 diabetes in the Chinese Han population: a meta-analysis.
26247673|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple ethnic groups in recent years. In the Chinese Han population in particular, numerous studies have evaluated the association between the rs11196218A/G polymorphism of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results have been inconsistent, so we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval values were calculated using a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model based on heterogeneity analysis. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on conformity with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group as well as on other variables, such as age, sex and body mass index. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to detect heterogeneity and to assess the stability of the results. In total, 10 case-control studies comprising 7,491 cases and 12,968 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The combined analysis indicated that the rs11196218A/G polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (G vs. A, OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.97-1.13, p=0.28). The subgroup analyses also did not show any association between the rs11196218A/G polymorphism and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the results of the subgroup analyses indicated that the absence of an association was not influenced by age, sex or body mass index. The results of the sensitivity analysis verified the reliability and stability of this meta-analysis. In conclusion, this study indicated that there is no significant association between the rs11196218A/G polymorphism and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Chinese Han population.

26273662|t|Association of the Genetic Polymorphisms in Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors- y 2 with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Its Interaction with Obesity Status in Emirati Population.
26273662|a|Background. Transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-y2 (PPAR-y2) have a profound effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and had previously been found to be associated with T2DM risk in various ppopulations. However, studies in the Arab population are inconsistent. We conducted a case control study to confirm the association of variants rs10885409 of TCF7L2 and Pro12Ala (rs1801282) of PPAR-y2 with risk of T2DM and related complications in Emirati population of Arab origin. We also investigated the interaction of these associations with obesity status. Methods. DNA was extracted from the saliva samples of 272 T2DM patients and 216 nondiabetic Emiratis. Genotyping for rs10885409 (TCF7L2) and rs1801282 (PPAR-y2 P12A) variants was accomplished with a TaqMan assay. The subgroups were constituted according to obesity status. Results. In the nonobese group, the rs10885409 C allele in the recessive model was significantly associated with the incidence of T2DM (OR 1.975 [95% CI 1.127-3.461], P = 0.017), but this association was not observed in the obese group or when BMI was not considered. PPAR-y2 risk allele Pro12 frequency (0.96) was similar in the groups tested and more than 90% population was homozygous for this allele. Conclusions. Our case-control study is the first of its kind in Emiratis which establishes TCF7L2 rs10885409 C allele as a T2DM risk factor in Emiratis and this association is modulated by obesity status. We also confirmed that Pro12Ala mutation in PPAR-y2 is not associated with T2DM risk in this population.

26345943|t|Association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Chinese Hui population.
26345943|a|Diabetes is one of costly chronic diseases. Previous studies across several ethnicities have shown that polymorphisms in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene were strongly associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the present study, the association between the TCF7L2 gene and the susceptibility to T2DM in a Chinese Hui population was interrogated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and allelic specific PCR were employed for examining the TCF7L2 gene rs12255372 (G>T) and rs290487 (C>T), and rs7901695 (T>C) polymorphisms, respectively, in 109 healthy individuals and 111 subjects with T2DM who were of Chinese Hui descent and lived in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of China. The results showed that the genotypic frequency of rs290487 and the allelic frequency distributions of the rs7901695 and rs290487 loci were not significantly different between patients and controls in this population. However, both the genotypic and the allelic frequencies at rs12255372 exhibited statistical differences between the patients with T2DM and the unaffected cohort (P < 0.01). In addition, the frequency of the G allele at the rs12255372 locus in the patients was higher than that in healthy individuals (OR = 1.198, 95%CI = 1.097-1.307). These findings suggest that the TCF7L2 rs12255372 (G>T) polymorphism might be one of the most important genetic factors associated with T2DM susceptibility, and that individuals in the Chinese Hui population who carry a G allele at this locus might be at risk to develop T2DM.

26367734|t|Type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility gene TCF7L2 is strongly associated with hyperglycemia in the Saudi Arabia Population of the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.
26367734|a|OBJECTIVE: We studied the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs4506565 in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility gene, transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) with T2DM among the population of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a case-control study, blood samples were collected from 359 T2DM patients and 351 age and sex-matched normoglycemic controls. Genotyping was done by allele specific PCR assay. RESULTS: Our results revealed a strong association between risk T alleles in variants rs12255372 (OR: G/T=1.4233; T/T=2.0395) and rs4506565 (OR: A/T=1.6066; T/T=3.1301) and T2DM among the Saudi population of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This is the first time that this association has been identified in a Saudi population. However, a common variant, rs7903146, often found to be associated with T2DM in other populations failed to demonstrate any association to T2DM with the present population. These data further strengthens the hypothesis that Saudi populations might carry a distinct risk allele in T2DM susceptibility gene TCF7L2. CONCLUSIONS: The present results confirm that rs12255372 and rs4506565 variants of TCF7L2 show an association, but not rs7903146, with T2DM for the Saudi population of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.

26393635|t|Association of TCF7L2 Genetic Polymorphisms with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the Uygur Population of China.
26393635|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been reported to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Icelandic, Danish and American populations and further replicated in other European populations, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Asian populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with T2DM in a Uygur population of China. METHODS: 877 T2DM patients and 871 controls were selected for the present study. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12255372 and rs7901695) were genotyped by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The associations of SNPs and haplotypes with T2DM and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the TCF7L2 gene were analyzed. RESULTS: For total participants and male, the distribution of rs12255372 alleles and the dominant model (Guanine Guanine (GG) genotype vs. Guanine Thymine (GT) genotype + Thymine Thymine (TT) genotype) showed significant difference between T2DM and control subjects (for allele: p = 0.013 and p = 0.002, respectively; for dominant model: p = 0.028 and p = 0.008, respectively). The distribution of rs7901695 alleles and the dominant model (TT genotype vs. Thymine Cytosine (TC) genotype + Cytosine Cytosine (CC) genotype) for total participants and male showed significant difference between T2DM and control subjects (for allele: both p = 0.001; for dominant model: p = 0.006 and p = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the genetic polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene were associated with T2DM in the Uygur population of China.

26458049|t|Genes associated with diabetes: potential for novel therapeutic targets?
26458049|a|INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease caused by an interaction between multiple genetic and environmental factors. T2D-associated loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) harbor the genes targeted by many clinically available drugs, supporting the idea that GWAS have the potential to discover novel genes for drug development. Areas covered: This paper outlines, among the genes at those T2D-associated loci, the functional analysis of FTO, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, and MTNR1B, illustrating caveats we should be cautious about. This paper also reviews the current status of the compounds targeting the T2D-associated genes GCK, GKRP, ADIPOQ, and ADRA2A in clinical and preclinical phases. Expert opinion: Functional analysis of those loci has fallen too far behind identification of T2D-associated loci. It is mandatory to define the true causal gene at the T2D-associated loci by using a variety of experimental techniques. The biggest challenge lies in the limited access to human tissues relevant to the pathogenesis of T2D. The ultimate goal of human genetic study is enabling personalized medicine based on the genetic information of individuals. More research will be needed to achieve this goal.

26499758|t|Association of type 2 diabetes GWAS loci and the risk of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.
26499758|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin and insulin-like growth factor contribute to normal brain function. Recent experimental and clinical studies showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several dysregulated pathways. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether genome-wide significant loci of T2DM are associated with the risk of PD and AD as well as the severity of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Study subjects were 500 PD patients, 400 AD patients, and 500 unrelated controls. We selected 32 genetic variants from 11 genes (CDC123, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, FTO, GLIS3, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and intergenic regions based on results of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in T2DM. These variants were reported to be T2DM-susceptibility loci and have been replicated in other independent studies. All association analyses were performed using logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS: KCNQ1 SNP rs163182 showed the strongest association with AD, but it was not significant after Bonferroni correction (OR  =  1.30, 95% CI  =  1.07-1.59, Pcorrected  =  0.32). In PD patients, CDC123 SNP rs11257655 showed modest association with MMSE score <26, and CDKN2B SNPs (rs2383208, rs10965250, and rs10811661) showed modest association with MoCA score <26, which were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Other genetic variants had no association with the risk of PD or AD and the severity of cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genome-wide significant loci of T2DM play no major role in the risk and cognitive impairment of PD and AD.

26499911|t|A replication study of 49 Type 2 diabetes risk variants in a Punjabi Pakistani population.
26499911|a|AIM: The burden of Type 2 diabetes is alarmingly high in South Asia, a region that has many genetically diverse ethnic populations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted largely in European populations have identified a number of loci predisposing to Type 2 diabetes risk, however, the relevance of such genetic loci in many South Asian sub-ethnicities remains elusive. The aim of this study was to replicate 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified through GWAS in Punjabis living in Pakistan. METHODS: We examined the association of 49 SNPs in 853 Type 2 diabetes cases and 1945 controls using additive logistic regression models after adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of the 49 SNPs investigated, eight showed a nominal association (P < 0.05) that also remained significant after controlling for the false discovery rate. The most significant association was found for rs7903146 at the TCF7L2 locus. For a per unit increase in the risk score comprising of all the 49 SNPs, the odds ratio in association with Type 2 diabetes risk was 1.16 (95% CI 1.13-1.19, P < 2.0E-16). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that some Type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci are shared between Europeans and Punjabis living in Pakistan.

26509107|t|Interaction of Wnt pathway related variants with type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population.
26509107|a|Aims. Epistasis from gene set based on the function-related genes may confer to the susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The Wnt pathway has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2D. Here we applied tag SNPs to explore the association between epistasis among genes from Wnt and T2D in the Han Chinese population. Methods. Variants of fourteen genes selected from Wnt pathways were performed to analyze epistasis. Gene-gene interactions in case-control samples were identified by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method. We performed a case-controlled association analysis on a total of 1,026 individual with T2D and 1,157 controls via tag SNPs in Wnt pathway. Results. In single-locus analysis, SNPs in four genes were significantly associated with T2D adjusted for multiple testing (rs7903146(C) in TCF7L2, p = 3.21   10(-3), OR = 1.39, 95% CI [1.31-1.47], rs12904944(G) in SMAD3, p = 2.51   10(-3), OR = 1.39, 95% CI [1.31-1.47], rs2273368(C) in WNT2B, p = 4.46   10(-3), OR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.11-1.32], rs6902123(C) in PPARD, p = 1.14   10(-2), OR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.32-1.48]). The haplotype TGC constructed by TCF7L2 (rs7903146), DKK1 (rs2241529) and BTRC (rs4436485) showed a significant association with T2D (OR = 0.750, 95% CI [0.579-0.972], P = 0.03). For epistasis analysis, the optimized combination was the two locus model of WNT2B rs2273368 and TCF7L2rs7903146, which had the maximum cross-validation consistency. This was 9 out of 10 for the sign test at 0.0107 level. The best combination increased the risk of T2D by 1.47 times (95% CI [1.13-1.91], p = 0.0039). Conclusions. Epistasis between TCF7L2 and WNT2B is associated with the susceptibility of T2D in a Han Chinese population. Our results were compatible with the idea of the complex nature of T2D that would have been missed using conventional tools.

26525881|t|TCF7L2 Genotype and a-Cell Function in Humans Without Diabetes.
26525881|a|The diabetes-associated allele in TCF7L2 increases the rate of conversion to diabetes; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. We hypothesized that the diabetes-associated allele in this locus (rs7903146) impairs insulin secretion and that this defect would be exacerbated by acute free fatty acid (FFA)-induced insulin resistance. We studied 120 individuals of whom one-half were homozygous for the diabetes-associated allele TT at rs7903146 and one-half were homozygous for the protective allele CC. After a screening examination during which glucose tolerance status was determined, subjects were studied on two occasions in random order while undergoing an oral challenge. During one study day, FFA was elevated by infusion of Intralipid plus heparin. On the other study day, subjects received the same amount of glycerol as present in the Intralipid infusion. b-Cell responsivity indices were estimated with the oral C-peptide minimal model. We report that b-cell responsivity was slightly impaired in the TT genotype group. Moreover, the hyperbolic relationship between insulin secretion and b-cell responsivity differed significantly between genotypes. Subjects also exhibited impaired suppression of glucagon after an oral challenge. These data imply that a genetic variant harbored within the TCF7L2 locus impairs glucose tolerance through effects on glucagon as well as on insulin secretion.

26536002|t|Transcription Factor-7-Like 2 Gene Variants Affect the Metabolic Phenotypes of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
26536002|a|BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy, which shares genetic features with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insofar as transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is consistently replicated T2DM susceptibility locus, this study evaluates whether common TCF7L2 variants are associated with PCOS and related metabolic features. METHODS: The association between TCF7L2 rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, and rs12255372 SNPs and PCOS was tested in 242 women with PCOS and in 236 control women. RESULTS: The allelic distribution of rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, and rs12255372 TCF7L2 variants was not significantly different between women with PCOS and control women. The genotype distribution of the 4 TCF7L2 loci was comparable between PCOS cases and controls, irrespective of the genetic analysis model used (additive, dominant, recessive). Carriage of rs4506565 minor allele correlated with free insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, while the presence of rs12243326 and rs12255372 minor allele correlated with waist changes. Four-locus (rs4506565-rs7903146, rs12243326, and rs12255372) haplotype analysis identified PCOS-susceptible (ACTG) and -protective (TTTG) haplotypes, which remained significant after controlling for multiple comparisons and for key covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Although individual TCF7L2 variants were not associated with the presence of PCOS in Bahraini women, specific TCF7L2 haplotypes were identified, which were both positively and negatively associated with PCOS.

26555947|t|The Role of TCF7L2 rs7903146 in Diabetes After Kidney Transplant: Results From a Single-Center Cohort and Meta-Analysis of the Literature.
26555947|a|BACKGROUND: Several genetic polymorphisms modulate the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), a complication associated with an increased morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation; however, their clinical utility is still undefined. METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in 464 kidney transplantation recipients to evaluate whether transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 gene polymorphism is associated with the risk of PTDM and a meta-analysis of similar studies including our results was performed (total kidney transplantation recipients, n = 3105). A predictive model of PTDM was built on the basis of this polymorphism and clinical parameters. RESULTS: In our cohort, 163 patients possessed the CC genotype of rs7903146 (35.1%), 237 were CT (51.1%), and 64 were TT (13.8%): their 2 years PTDM incidence was, respectively, 7.8%, 11.9%, and 22.7%. At multivariate analysis, age (per year; hazard ratio [HR], 1.029; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.005-1.054; P = 0.017), body mass index (25.0-29.9 vs <25.0; HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.40-4.23; P = 0.0018; >= 30 vs <25.0; HR, 5.70; 95% CI, 2.77-11.74; P < 0.0001), TCF7L2 rs7903146 (per each T allele; HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26-2.59; P = 0.001) and previous transplants (HR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.39-5.64; P = 0.004) emerged as independent predictive factors for PTDM.Meta-analysis of present and 5 previous studies showed higher risk of PTDM in carriers of rs7903146 TT genotype (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.39-2.74; P < 0.0001) and absence of heterogeneity among studies (I = 0%).Inclusion of this polymorphism in a predictive model appeared to improve its ability to stratify patients according to the risk of PTDM. CONCLUSIONS: In renal transplant patients, TCF7L2 rs7903146 is strongly and independently associated with PTDM and might hold the potential to identify patients at risk for this complication.

26576435|t|The Protective Effect of Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Risk Allele rs7903146 against Elevated Fasting Plasma Triglyceride in Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.
26576435|a|UNASSIGNED: Background. The results from published studies regarding association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variant rs7903146 with dyslipidemia have been conflicting and inconclusive. Methods. We carried out a meta-analysis that aimed to investigate the association of the rs7903146 variant with plasma lipid levels using electronic database and published studies. Data was extracted by a standard algorithm. Dominant, recessive, homozygote, and heterozygote comparison models were utilized. Results. 24 studies incorporating 52,785 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the minor allele (T) was associated with lower risk for hypertriglyceridemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes (dominant model: SMD = -0.04, 95% CI (-0.08, 0.00), P = 0.048, P heterogeneity = 0.47; recessive model: SMD = -0.10, 95% CI (-0.18, -0.02), P = 0.01, P heterogeneity = 0.56). No association was found between minor (T) allele and plasma TC, LDL-c, or HDL-c levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome (MetS) and no association was found between minor (T) allele and plasma TG levels in nondiabetic subjects. Conclusions. Our meta-analysis indicated the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and low plasma triglyceride (TG) level in subjects with type 2 diabetes. No association was found between rs7903146 variant and plasma lipids in nondiabetic subjects.

26587547|t|Association between Genetic Variants and Diabetes Mellitus in Iranian Populations: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies.
26587547|a|UNASSIGNED: Introduction. Diabetes mellitus as the most prevalent metabolic disease is a multifactorial disease which is influenced by environmental and genetic factors. In this systematic review, we assessed the association between genetic variants and diabetes/its complications in studies with Iranian populations. Methods. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Persian web databases were systematically searched up to January 2014. The search terms were "gene," "polymorphism," "diabetes," and "diabetic complications"; nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, foot ulcer, and CAD (coronary artery diseases); and Persian equivalents. Animal studies, letters to editor, and in vitro studies were excluded. Results. Out of overall 3029 eligible articles, 88 articles were included. We found significant association between CTLA-4, IL-18, VDR, TAP2, IL-12, and CD4 genes and T1DM, HNFa and MODY, haptoglobin, paraoxonase, leptin, TCF7L2, calreticulin, ERa, PPAR-y2, CXCL5, calpain-10, IRS-1 and 2, GSTM1, KCNJ11, eNOS, VDR, INSR, ACE, apoA-I, apo E, adiponectin, PTPN1, CETP, AT1R, resistin, MMP-3, BChE K, AT2R, SUMO4, IL-10, VEGF, MTHFR, and GSTM1 with T2DM or its complications. Discussion. We found some controversial results due to heterogeneity in ethnicity and genetic background. We thought genome wide association studies on large number of samples will be helpful in identifying diabetes susceptible genes as an alternative to studying individual candidate genes in Iranian populations.

26599349|t|The Association of Type 2 Diabetes Loci Identified in Genome-Wide Association Studies with Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components in a Chinese Population with Type 2 Diabetes.
26599349|a|Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is prevalent in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. The comorbidity of MetS and T2D increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. The aim of the present study was to determine the T2D-related genetic variants that contribute to MetS-related components in T2D patients of Chinese ancestry. We successfully genotyped 25 genome wide association study validated T2D-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 5,169 T2D individuals and 4,560 normal glycemic controls recruited from the Chinese National Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Study (DMS). We defined MetS in this population using the harmonized criteria (2009) combined with the Chinese criteria for abdominal obesity. The associations between SNPs and MetS-related components, as well as the associations between SNPs and risk for T2D with or without MetS, were subjected to logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex. Results showed that the T2D risk alleles of rs243021 located near BCL11A, rs10830963 in MTNR1B, and rs2237895 in KCNQ1 were related to a lower risk for abdominal obesity in T2D patients (rs243021: 0.92 (0.84, 1.00), P = 4.42 * 10-2; rs10830963: 0.92 (0.85, 1.00), P = 4.07 * 10-2; rs2237895: 0.89 (0.82, 0.98), P = 1.29 * 10-2). The T2D risk alleles of rs972283 near KLF14 contributed to a higher risk of elevated blood pressure (1.10 (1.00, 1.22), P = 4.48 * 10-2), while the T2D risk allele of rs7903146 in TCF7L2 was related to a lower risk for elevated blood pressure (0.74 (0.61, 0.90), P = 2.56 * 10-3). The T2D risk alleles of rs972283 near KLF14 and rs11634397 near ZFAND6 were associated with a higher risk for elevated triglycerides (rs972283: 1.11 (1.02, 1.24), P = 1.46 * 10-2; rs11634397: 1.14 (1.00, 1.29), P = 4.66 * 10-2), while the T2D risk alleles of rs780094 in GCKR and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 were related to a lower risk of elevated triglycerides (rs780094: 0.86 (0.80, 0.93), P = 1.35 * 10-4; rs7903146: 0.82 (0.69, 0.98), P = 3.18 * 10-2). The genotype risk score of the 25 T2D-related SNPs was related to a lower risk for abdominal obesity (Ptrend = 1.29 * 10-2) and lower waist circumference (P = 2.20 * 10-3). Genetic variants of WFS1, CDKAL1, CDKN2BAS, TCF7L2, HHEX, KCNQ1, TSPAN8/LGR5, FTO, and TCF2 were associated with the risk for T2D with MetS, as well as the risk for development of T2D with at least one of the MetS components (P < 0.05). In addition, genetic variants of BCL11A, GCKR, ADAMTS9, CDKAL1, KLF14, CDKN2BAS, TCF7L2, CDC123/CAMK1D, HHEX, MTNR1B, and KCNQ1 contributed to the risk for T2D without MetS (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings highlight the contribution of T2D-related genetic loci to MetS in a Chinese Han population. The study also provides insight into the pleotropic effects of genome-wide association loci of diabetes on metabolic regulation.

26604685|t|Prevalence of the rs7903146C>T polymorphism in TCF7L2 gene for prediction of type 2 diabetes risk among Iranians of different ethnicities.
26604685|a|BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic polymorphisms affecting responses to drug therapy. The common rs7903146 (C>T) polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene has recently been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, prevalence of the rs7903146 (C>T) polymorphism in the TCF7L2 gene for prediction of T2D risk was examined in an Iranian population of different ethnicities. METHODS: The prevalence of rs7903146 (C>T) and the predicted phenotypes, including extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers were investigated in blood samples of 300 unrelated healthy individuals in an Iranian population, including Fars, Turk, Lure, and Kurd, using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct genomic DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The homozygous wild-type (C/C), heterozygous (C/T), and homozygous (T/T) allelic frequencies of rs7903146 (C>T) in the TCF7L2 gene were 29% (extensive metabolizers), 66.34% (intermediate metabolizers), and 4.66% (poor metabolizers), respectively. The C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypic frequencies of the rs7903146 (C>T) allele were significantly different (P<0.01) among Iranians of different ethnicities. The frequency of the homozygous T/T variant of the rs7903146 (C>T) allele was significantly low in the Lure (P<0.01) and high in the Fars (P<0.001) ethnicities. Additionally, the frequency of the T/T variant of the rs7903146 (C>T) allele in the South of Iran was the highest (P<0.04), while the East of Iran had the lowest frequency (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The prediction of rs7903146 (C>T) is required in drug research and routine treatment, where the information would be helpful for clinicians to optimize therapy and adverse drug reactions and predict drug response in individuals at risk of T2D.

26608632|t|Association between the rs12255372 variant of the TCF7L2 gene and obesity in a Cameroonian population.
26608632|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is one of the genes that have been identified as possible determinants of diabetes which is associated with obesity. Data on the genetic causes of obesity in sub-Saharan African populations are very scares. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism (rs12255372 G/T) and obesity and weight-related traits in a Cameroonian population. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 35 obese and 30 non-obese Cameroonian adults. TCF7L2 rs12255372 genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP and correlated with BMI and weight-related traits. RESULTS: No significant association was observed between the rs12255372 T allele (  (2)  =  0.0684, p  =  0.79) or the TT genotype (  (2)  =  0.372, p  =  0.54) of the TCF7L2 gene and obesity in the Cameroonian population. However, amongst the weight-related traits, triglycerides were significantly associated with the T risk allele of the TCF7L2 gene (p  =  0.012). CONCLUSION: This study on Cameroonian subjects replicates the absence of association between the TCF7L2 rs12255372 variant and obesity as observed in European and American populations.

26616591|t|Non-Association between rs7903146 and rs12255372 Polymorphisms in Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Gene and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Jahrom City, Iran.
26616591|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a transcription factor in the Wnt signaling pathway. High levels of TCF7L2 have been reported in most human tissues, including the heart, lung, brain, liver, kidney, placenta, adipose tissues, and pancreatic b-cells. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms (rs12255372 and rs7903146) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the city of Jahrom, Iran. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted with 200 patients referred to Diabetes Clinics and 200 healthy subjects in Jahrom City. Biochemical characteristics were first determined. TCF7L2 rs1255372 and rs7903146 polymorphisms were then genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: T-allele frequencies of both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in normal glucose-tolerant subjects (rs12255372: 20.3% vs. 14.5%; rs7903146: 28.5% vs. 22.25%). The rs12255372 (G/T) polymorphism analysis showed an odds ratio of 0.473 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.170 to 1.314; P=0.151) for the TT genotype and 0.646 (95% CI, 0.410 to 1.019; P=0.060) for the TG genotype, compared with the GG genotype. The rs7903146 (C/T) polymorphism odds ratios for TT and TC genotypes were 0.564 (95% CI, 0.280 to 1.135; P=0.109) and 0.751 (95% CI, 0.487 to 1.157; P=0.194) compared with the CC genotype, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rs12255372 and rs7903146 SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene were not associated with insulin resistance in the evaluated population.

26634513|t|Quantitative candidate gene association studies of metabolic traits in Han Chinese type 2 diabetes patients.
26634513|a|Recent genome-wide association studies have identified many loci associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperuricemia, and obesity in various ethnic populations. However, quantitative traits have been less well investigated in Han Chinese T2DM populations. We investigated the association between candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolic syndrome-related quantitative traits in Han Chinese T2DM subjects. Unrelated Han Chinese T2DM patients (1975) were recruited. Eighty-six SNPs were genotyped and tested for association with quantitative traits including lipid profiles, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum uric acid (SUA), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)], plasma glucose 120 min post-OGTT (P2PG; OGTT = oral glucose tolerance test), and insulin resistance-related traits. We found that CAMTA1, ABI2, VHL, KAT2B, PKHD1, ESR1, TOX, SLC30A8, SFI1, and MYH9 polymorphisms were associated with HbA1c, FPG, and/or P2PG; GCK, HHEX, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and TBX5 polymorphisms were associated with insulin resistance-related traits; ABCG2, SLC2A9, and PKHD1 polymorphisms were associated with SUA; CAMTA1, VHL, KAT2B, PON1, NUB1, SLITRK5, SMAD3, FTO, FANCA, and PCSK2 polymorphisms were associated with blood lipid traits; CAMTA1, SPAG16, TOX, KCNQ1, ACACB, and MYH9 polymorphisms were associated with blood pressure; and UBE2E3, SPAG16, SLC2A9, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, SMAD3, and PNPLA3 polymorphisms were associated with BMI (all P values <0.05). Some of the candidate genes were associated with metabolic and anthropometric traits in T2DM in Han Chinese. Although none of these associations reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)), genes and loci identified in this study are worthy of further replication and investigation.

26635871|t|Evaluation of Genome Wide Association Study Associated Type 2 Diabetes Susceptibility Loci in Sub Saharan Africans.
26635871|a|Genome wide association studies (GWAS) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) undertaken in European and Asian ancestry populations have yielded dozens of robustly associated loci. However, the genomics of T2D remains largely understudied in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where rates of T2D are increasing dramatically and where the environmental background is quite different than in these previous studies. Here, we evaluate 106 reported T2D GWAS loci in continental Africans. We tested each of these SNPs, and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with these index SNPs, for an association with T2D in order to assess transferability and to fine map the loci leveraging the generally reduced LD of African genomes. The study included 1775 unrelated Africans (1035 T2D cases, 740 controls; mean age 54 years; 59% female) enrolled in Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya as part of the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study. All samples were genotyped on the Affymetrix Axiom PanAFR SNP array. Forty-one of the tested loci showed transferability to this African sample (p < 0.05, same direction of effect), 11 at the exact reported SNP and 30 others at SNPs in LD with the reported SNP (after adjustment for the number of tested SNPs). TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 was the most significant locus in this study (p = 1.61 * 10(-8)). Most of the loci that showed transferability were successfully fine-mapped, i.e., localized to smaller haplotypes than in the original reports. The findings indicate that the genetic architecture of T2D in SSA is characterized by several risk loci shared with non-African ancestral populations and that data from African populations may facilitate fine mapping of risk loci. The study provides an important resource for meta-analysis of African ancestry populations and transferability of novel loci.

26673680|t|Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Association of Candidate Genes in Asian Indian Population from Hyderabad, India.
26673680|a|INTRODUCTION: Genetic and environmental factors play an important role in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several genes have been implicated in the development of T2DM. Genetic variants of candidate genes are, therefore, prime targets for molecular analysis. AIM: In this study, we have selected 3 candidate genes, namely, TCF7L2, SLC30A8, and IGF2, for assessing their association with T2DM in an Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred individuals were enrolled in this case-control study- 250 T2DM patients and 250 healthy control individuals. Clinical characteristics were obtained for all subjects, and genotype analysis was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. RESULTS: Allele and genotyping frequencies, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1 each from TCF7L2 (rs7903146), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and IGF2 (rs680) in T2DM patients. The rs7903146 and rs680 polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with T2DM (p < 0.05), whereas the rs13266634 polymorphism was not (p > 0.05). The multifactor dimensionality reduction method identified the particular polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of disease. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that the gene-gene interaction model successfully predicted T2DM risk based on TCF7L2 and SLC30A8 polymorphisms. These results provide strong evidence of independent association between T2DM and the 3 SNPs analysed herein.

26681031|t|Meta-analysis of the association between the rs7903146 polymorphism at the TCF7L2 locus and type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility.
26681031|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease caused by genetic and environmental factors. T2DM has been associated with specific polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene. This study evaluates the relationship between the rs7903146 locus polymorphism of the TCF7L2 gene and T2DM susceptibility through meta-analysis; the overall aim is to provide a basis for evidence-based medicinal treatment of T2DM. Cohort and case-control studies from Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, and academic conferences/dissertations that examined the correlation between T2DM and rs7903146 polymorphisms were evaluated. We determined whether the TCF7L2 rs7903146 locus was associated with T2DM susceptibility by comparing alleles and genotypes. The Stata 11.0 software was applied for meta-analysis, and a random-effects model was adopted for heterogeneity testing and odds ratio (OR) calculation. A fixed-effect model was used for quantitative analysis of the heterogeneity between different studies, and for calculating the percentage of variability I(2). A total of 10 studies related to the rs7903146 loci and T2DM susceptibility were enrolled; this included 3404 cases of T2DM patients and 6473 control cases. Meta-analysis showed that the T allele of rs7903146 was significantly correlated with the risk of T2DM, with both a dominant fixed-effect model (OR = 1.653, 95%CI = 1.416-1.653) and a co-dominant-fixed effect model (OR = 1.525, 95%CI = 1.350-1.723). Meta-analysis revealed that the T allele of rs7903146 was also correlated with T2DM susceptibility.

26696123|t|a-Cell Dysfunctions and Molecular Alterations in Male Insulinopenic Diabetic Mice Are Not Completely Corrected by Insulin.
26696123|a|UNASSIGNED: Glucagon and a-cell dysfunction are critical in the development of hyperglycemia during diabetes both in humans and rodents. We hypothesized that a-cell dysfunction leading to dysregulated glucagon secretion in diabetes is due to both a lack of insulin and intrinsic defects. To characterize a-cell dysfunction in diabetes, we used glucagon-Venus transgenic male mice and induced insulinopenic hyperglycemia by streptozotocin administration leading to alterations of glucagon secretion. We investigated the in vivo impact of insulinopenic hyperglycemia on glucagon-producing cells using FACS-sorted a-cells from control and diabetic mice. We demonstrate that increased glucagonemia in diabetic mice is mainly due to increases of glucagon release and biosynthesis per cell compared with controls without changes in a-cell mass. We identified genes coding for proteins involved in glucagon biosynthesis and secretion, a-cell differentiation, and potential stress markers such as the glucagon, Arx, MafB, cMaf, Brain4, Foxa1, Foxa3, HNF4a, TCF7L2, Glut1, Sglt2, Cav2.1, Cav2.2, Nav1.7, Kir6.2/Sur1, Pten, IR, NeuroD1, GPR40, and Sumo1 genes, which were abnormally regulated in diabetic mice. Importantly, insulin treatment partially corrected a-cell function and expression of genes coding for proglucagon, or involved in glucagon secretion, glucose transport and insulin signaling but not those coding for cMAF, FOXA1, and a-cell differentiation markers as well as GPR40, NEUROD1, CAV2.1, and SUMO1. Our results indicate that insulinopenic diabetes induce marked a-cell dysfunction and molecular alteration, which are only partially corrected by in vivo insulin treatment.

26771085|t|Wnt9a deficiency discloses a repressive role of Tcf7l2 on endocrine differentiation in the embryonic pancreas.
26771085|a|Transcriptional and signaling networks establish complex cross-regulatory interactions that drive cellular differentiation during development. Using microarrays we identified the gene encoding the ligand Wnt9a as a candidate target of Neurogenin3, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that functions as a master regulator of pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Here we show that Wnt9a is expressed in the embryonic pancreas and that its deficiency enhances activation of the endocrine transcriptional program and increases the number of endocrine cells at birth. We identify the gene encoding the endocrine transcription factor Nkx2-2 as one of the most upregulated genes in Wnt9a-ablated pancreases and associate its activation to reduced expression of the Wnt effector Tcf7l2. Accordingly, in vitro studies confirm that Tcf7l2 represses activation of Nkx2-2 by Neurogenin3 and inhibits Nkx2-2 expression in differentiated b-cells. Further, we report that Tcf7l2 protein levels decline upon initiation of endocrine differentiation in vivo, disclosing the downregulation of this factor in the developing endocrine compartment. These findings highlight the notion that modulation of signalling cues by lineage-promoting factors is pivotal for controlling differentiation programs.

26789123|t|A HuGE Review and Meta-Analyses of Genetic Associations in New Onset Diabetes after Kidney Transplantation.
26789123|a|PURPOSE: New onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious complication following solid organ transplantation. There is a genetic contribution to NODAT and we have conducted comprehensive meta-analysis of available genetic data in kidney transplant populations. METHODS: Relevant articles investigating the association between genetic markers and NODAT were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. SNPs described in a minimum of three studies were included for analysis using a random effects model. The association between identified variants and NODAT was calculated at the per-study level to generate overall significance values and effect sizes. RESULTS: Searching the literature returned 4,147 citations. Within the 36 eligible articles identified, 18 genetic variants from 12 genes were considered for analysis. Of these, three were significantly associated with NODAT by meta-analysis at the 5% level of significance; CDKAL1 rs10946398 p = 0.006 OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.11-1.85 (n = 696 individuals), KCNQ1 rs2237892 p = 0.007 OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.10-1.86 (n = 1,270 individuals), and TCF7L2 rs7903146 p = 0.01 OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07-1.85 (n = 2,967 individuals). CONCLUSION: Evaluating cumulative evidence for SNPs associated with NODAT in kidney transplant recipients has revealed three SNPs associated with NODAT. An adequately powered, dense genome-wide association study will provide more information using a carefully defined NODAT phenotype.

28330327|t|Role of GNB3, NET, KCNJ11, TCF7L2 and GRL genes single nucleotide polymorphism in the risk prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
28330327|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a polygenic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia occurring as a result of impaired insulin secretion or insulin resistance. Various environmental and genetic factors interact and increase the risk of T2DM and its complications. Among the various genetic factors associated with T2DM, single nucleotide polymorphism in different candidate genes have been studied intensively and the resulting genetic variants have been found to have either positive or negative association with T2DM thereby increasing or decreasing the risk of T2DM, respectively. In this review, we will focus on Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta 3 (GNB3), Norepinephrine Transporter (NET), Potassium Channel gene (KCNJ11), Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) and Glucocorticoid receptor (GRL) genes and their association with T2DM studied in different ethnic groups. The products of these genes are involved in the biochemical pathway leading to T2DM. Polymorphisms in these genes have been intensively studied in individuals of different ethnic origins. Results show that genetic variants of TCF7L2 and KCNJ11 genes have potential to emerge as a risk biomarker for T2DM whereas results of GNB3, GRL and NET genes have been controversial when studied in individuals of different ethnicities. We have tried to summarize the results generated globally in context to the selected genes which could possibly help researchers working in this field and would eventually help in understanding the mechanistic pathways of T2DM leading early diagnosis and prevention.

30258876|t|Current understanding and dispute on the function of the Wnt signaling pathway effector TCF7L2 in hepatic gluconeogenesis.
30258876|a|Approximately 10 years ago, the Wnt signaling pathway effector TCF7L2 (=TCF-4) was recognized as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk gene through a genome wide association study (GWAS). As the correlation between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and T2D susceptibility has been reproducibly observed by numerous follow-up investigations among different ethnic groups, great efforts have been made to explore the function of TCF7L2 in metabolic organs including the pancreas, liver and adipose tissues. Although these explorations have enriched our general knowledge on the Wnt signaling cascade in metabolic homeostasis, studies conducted to date have also generated controversial suggestions. Here I will provide a brief review on the Wnt signaling pathway as well as the milestone GWAS discovery and the follow-up studies. I will then discuss the two different opinions on the correlation between TCF7L2 variants and T2D risk, a gain-of-function event versus a loss-of-function event. This will be followed by summarizing the relevant investigations on the metabolic function of hepatic TCF7L2 and presenting our view on the discrepancy and perspectives.

26803651|t|Genetics of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Maternal Metabolism.
26803651|a|UNASSIGNED: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Women with a history of GDM are at long-term risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM), raising the question to what extent GDM and T2DM share a common genetic architecture. Meta-analysis of candidate gene studies and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) have identified a number of genes which are reproducibly associated with GDM, including TCF7L2, GCK, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, MTNR1B, and IRS1. These genes are also associated with T2DM. Candidate gene and GWAS have also identified genes associated with maternal metabolic traits, most of which are also associated with metabolic traits in the general population. Two genes, BACE2 and HKDC1, are uniquely associated with maternal metabolic traits. These studies suggest that there are similarities and differences between the genetic architecture of GDM and T2DM and metabolic quantitative traits in pregnant and non-pregnant populations.

26810132|t|Genetic markers predicting sulphonylurea treatment outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients: current evidence and challenges for clinical implementation.
26810132|a|The clinical response to sulphonylurea, an oral antidiabetic agent often used in combination with metformin to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, has been widely associated with a number of gene polymorphisms, particularly those involved in insulin release. We have reviewed the genetic markers of CYP2C9, ABCC8, KCNJ11, TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2), IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1), CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, KCNQ1 and NOS1AP (nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein) genes that predict treatment outcomes of sulphonylurea therapy. A convincing pattern for poor sulphonylurea response was observed in Caucasian T2DM patients with rs7903146 and rs1801278 polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 and IRS-1 genes, respectively. However, limitations in evaluating the available studies including dissimilarities in study design, definitions of clinical end points, sample sizes and types and doses of sulphonylureas used as well as ethnic variability make the clinical applications challenging. Future studies need to address these limitations to develop personalized sulphonylurea medicine for T2DM management.

26822092|t|Diabetes-Associated Variation in TCF7L2 Is Not Associated With Hepatic or Extrahepatic Insulin Resistance.
26822092|a|A common genetic variation in TCF7L2 is associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. In addition to affecting insulin secretion, genetic variation at the TCF7L2 locus may alter insulin action or directly modify hepatic glucose metabolism. We sought to determine whether the diabetes-associated variant in this locus (the T allele of rs7903146) increases fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP), and impairs insulin-induced suppression of EGP and insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance. To address this, we studied individuals who were either homozygous for the diabetes-associated allele (TT) at rs7903146 or were homozygous for the protective allele (CC). Subjects were matched for other anthropometric characteristics and were studied using a euglycemic clamp. EGP and glucose uptake were measured using the tracer dilution technique, and the relative contribution of gluconeogenesis to EGP was quantitated using deuterated water corrected for transaldolase exchange. We report that the diabetes-associated variation in TCF7L2 did not associate with fasting EGP, insulin-induced suppression of EGP, and insulin-induced stimulation of glucose uptake. There was no association with the contribution of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGP. These data indicate that genetic variation at TCF7L2 does not predispose an individual to type 2 diabetes by altering either hepatic or extrahepatic insulin action.

26830076|t|Genetic risk of type 2 diabetes in populations of the African continent: A systematic review and meta-analyses.
26830076|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is growing faster in Africa than anywhere else, driven by the dual effects of genetic and environmental factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies on genetic markers of T2D in populations within Africa. METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for studies of genetic variants associated with T2D in populations living in Africa. Studies reporting on the association of a genetic marker with T2D or indicators of glycaemia were included. Data were extracted on study design and characteristics, genetic determinants, effect estimates of associations with T2D. FINDINGS: Overall, 100 polymorphisms in 57 genes have been investigated in relation with T2D in populations within Africa, in 60 studies. Almost all studies used the candidate gene approach, with >88% published during 2006-2014 and 70% (42/60) originating from Tunisia and Egypt. Polymorphisms in ACE, AGRP, eNOS, GSTP1, HSP70-2, MC4R, MTHFR, PHLPP, POL1, TCF7L2, and TNF-a gene were found to be associated with T2D, with overlapping effect on various cardiometabolic traits. The polymorphisms investigated in multiple studies mostly had consistent effects across studies, with only modest or no statistical heterogeneity. Effect sizes were modestly significant [e.g., odd ratio 1.49 (95%CI 1.33-1.66) for TCF7L2 (rs7903146)]. Underpowered genome-wide studies revealed no diabetes risk loci specific to African populations. INTERPRETATION: Current evidence on the genetic markers of T2D in African populations mostly originate from North African countries, is overall scanty and largely insufficient to reliably inform the genetic architecture of T2D across Africa.

26845344|t|HMGB1 binds to the rs7903146 locus in TCF7L2 in human pancreatic islets.
26845344|a|The intronic SNP rs7903146 in the T-cell factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) is the common genetic variant most highly associated with Type 2 diabetes known to date. The risk T-allele is located in an open chromatin region specific to human pancreatic islets of Langerhans, thereby accessible for binding of regulatory proteins. The risk T-allele locus exhibits stronger enhancer activity compared to the non-risk C-allele. The aim of this study was to identify transcriptional regulators that bind the open chromatin region in the rs7903146 locus and thereby potentially regulate TCF7L2 expression and activity. Using affinity chromatography followed by Edman sequencing, we identified one candidate regulatory protein, i.e. high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). The binding of HMGB1 to the rs7903146 locus was confirmed in pancreatic islets from human deceased donors, in HCT116 and in HEK293  cell lines using: (i) protein purification on affinity columns followed by Western blot, (ii) chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR and (iii) electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results also suggested that HMGB1 might have higher binding affinity to the C-allele of rs7903146 compared to the T-allele, which was supported in  vitro using Dynamic Light Scattering, possibly in a tissue-specific manner. The functional consequence of HMGB1 depletion in HCT116 and INS1 cells was reduced insulin and TCF7L2 mRNA expression, TCF7L2 transcriptional activity and glucose stimulated insulin secretion. These findings suggest that the rs7903146 locus might exert its enhancer function by interacting with HMGB1 in an allele dependent manner.

26914832|t|Association between the rs7903146 Polymorphism in the TCF7L2 Gene and Parameters Derived with Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Individuals without Diabetes.
26914832|a|BACKGROUND: The rs7903146-T allele in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene has been associated with impaired pancreatic insulin secretion, enhanced liver glucose production, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, the impact of rs7903146 on daily glucose trajectories remains unclear. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can estimate glycemia and glycemic variability based on consecutive glucose measurements collected over several days. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of rs7903146 with glycemia and glycemic variability in middle-aged participants without diabetes. METHODS: Complete data from 235 participants without diabetes from the Leiden Longevity Study were available. Participants were divided into two groups based on rs7903146 genotype; rs7903146-CC genotype carriers (N = 123) and rs7903146-CT/TT genotype carriers (N = 112). Validated parameters of glycemia (e.g., mean 24h glucose level) and glycemic variability (e.g., 24h standard deviation) were derived from data collected with a CGM system for a 72-hour period. RESULTS: The study population was on average 64.7 years old (standard deviation = 5.9) and composed of 49.8% of women. Compared with rs7903146-CC carriers, rs7903146-CT/TT carriers exhibited a trend towards a higher mean 24-hour glucose level (5.21 versus 5.32 mmol/L; p-value = 0.15) and a significantly higher mean nocturnal glucose (3:00am- 6:00am; 4.48 versus 4.67 mmol/L; p-value = 0.03) that was explained for 34.6% by body weight and percentage body fat. No differences in measures of glycemic variability between the genotype groups were observed. CONCLUSION: Despite limited sample size, our study indicates that the rs7903146-T allele in TCF7L2 was associated with a higher mean nocturnal glucose dependent on body composition, which might suggest that rs7902146 affects liver-specific aspects of glucose metabolism.

26919830|t|Association between genetic variants and characteristic symptoms of type 2 diabetes: A matched case-control study.
26919830|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of genetic variants with characteristic symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: A matched case-control study was performed to investigate the association between common variants in four genes (CDKAL1, GLIS3, GRK5, and TCF7L2) and symptoms of T2DM. Symptoms were examined with questionnaire for 710 subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cell by salting-out procedure. Genotyping was carried out by direct sequencing of the unpurified polymerase chain reaction products. RESULT: Most of the T2DM patients pressented characteristic symptoms, such as feeling weak in limbs (P =0.0057), hand tremor (P =0.0208), bradymasesis (P =0.0234), and polyuria (P =0.0051). Some of the T2DM patients shared characteristic symptoms, such as desire for cold drinks (P =0.0304), polyphagia (P =0.0051), and furred tongue (P =0.028). The impaired glucose regulation (IGR) cases took only one characteristic symptom of frequent micturition (P =0.0422). GLIS3 rs7034200 and GRK5 rs10886471 were significantly associated with increased T2DM risk (GLIS3 rs7034200 under dominant model: P=0.0307; GRK5 rs10886471 under recessive model: P=0.0092). However, only the rs10886471 polymorphism in GRK5 showed a significant effect on both differentiated symptoms and T2DM risk. The C-allele was involved in both dampness-heat encumbering Pi (Spleen) syndrome (P =0.047) and qi-yin deficiency syndrome (P =0.002) via increased GRK5 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Both T2DM and IGR exhibited its corresponding characteristic symptoms. The variants of GRK5 were involved with both qi-yin deficiency syndrome and dampness-heat encumbering Pi syndrome.

26934194|t|Accumulating evidence for a role of TCF7L2 variants in bipolar disorder with elevated body mass index.
26934194|a|OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex disease associated with various hereditary traits, including a higher body mass index (BMI). In a prior genome-wide association study, we found that BMI modified the association of rs12772424 - a common variant in the gene encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) - with risk for BD. TCF7L2 is a transcription factor in the canonical Wnt pathway, involved in multiple disorders, including diabetes, cancer and psychiatric conditions. Here, using an independent sample, we evaluated 26 TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explore further the association of BD with the TCF7L2-BMI interaction. METHODS: Using a sample of 662 BD cases and 616 controls, we conducted SNP-level and gene-level tests to assess the evidence for an association between BD and the interaction of BMI and genetic variation in TCF7L2. We also explored the potential mechanism behind the detected associations using human brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. RESULTS: The analysis provided independent evidence of an rs12772424-BMI interaction (p = 0.011). Furthermore, while overall there was no evidence for SNP marginal effects on BD, the TCF7L2-BMI interaction was significant at the gene level (p = 0.042), with seven of the 26 SNPs showing SNP-BMI interaction effects with p < 0.05. The strongest evidence of interaction was observed for rs7895307 (p = 0.006). TCF7L2 expression showed a significant enrichment of association with the expression of other genes in the Wnt canonical pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides further evidence suggesting that TCF7L2 involvement in BD risk may be regulated by BMI. Detailed, prospective assessment of BMI, comorbidity, and other possible contributing factors is necessary to explain fully the mechanisms underlying this association.

26958016|t|Contribution of ENPP1, TCF7L2, and FTO polymorphisms to type 2 diabetes in mixed ancestry ethnic population of South Africa.
26958016|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO), and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase gene (ENPP1) are known risk loci for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mostly in European populations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of these genes with T2DM risk in a South African mixed-ancestry population. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty six participants were genotyped for ENPP1-rs997509 and -rs1044498, FTO-9941349 and -rs3751812, TCF7L2-rs12255372 and -rs7903146 polymorphisms using Taqman genotyping assays and validated by automated sequencing to assess the association of the polymorphisms with cardiometabolic traits. RESULTS: In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance, minor allele of rs997509 was associated with a higher risk of prevalent T2DM under a recessive model [odd ratio 4.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 19.86); p = 0.040].Under additive model, the rs7903146 [1.43 (1.00 to 2.04); p= 0.053] and rs9941349 [1.43 (1.00 to 2.04); p = 0.052] minor alleles showed marginally significant associations with a high risk of T2DM. However, only the rs7903146 alleles (p=0.011) and genotypes (p=0.025) distributions were statistically significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that ENPP1, TCF7L2, and FTO may predispose to T2DM in the mixed-ancestry population.

26986145|t|Association of the Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2) Polymorphism With Diabetic Nephropathy Risk: A Meta-Analysis.
26986145|a|It is assumed that genetic factors may participate in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). The association between TCF7L2 gene polymorphism and DN risk is still unclear. To evaluate the relationship, we performed this meta-analysis.Eligible relevant studies were searched and selected from PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Science. Summary effect estimates were derived using a random effects model, with attention to study quality and publication bias. Ethnical approval was not necessary, because this meta-analysis was based on published articles, and did not involve patient consent.A total of 7 studies were identified. Analysis of all studies indicated significant association between TCF7L2 gene polymorphism and DN risk (odds ratio [OR]=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.10-1.56, Pheterogeneity<0.00001, P=0.002). Subgroup analysis showed similar results in Asian (OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.10-1.62, Pheterogeneity=0.03, P=0.004), in Caucasian (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.78-2.90, Pheterogeneity=0.17, P<0.00001), in rs7903146 mutation (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.25-2.07, Pheterogeneity<0.00001, P=0.0002), However, no association was observed in Negroid (OR=1.10, 95% CI=0.90-1.35, Pheterogeneity<00001, P=0.36).Our results suggest that TCF7L2 gene polymorphism may contribute to the risk of DN. However, more studies should be launched in the future.

27008632|t|Combined Influence of Genetic Variants and Gene-gene Interaction on Sulfonylurea Efficacy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.
27008632|a|UNASSIGNED: Several genes have been shown to influence the response to sulfonylureas in previous studies. However, their interactions and combined genetic influence on sulfonylurea efficacy remain mostly unexplored. So the aim of this study was to examine the interactions of these published susceptibility alleles and access the potential utility of combining information for drug response prediction. Methods: We genotyped 5 variants of these genes in a total of 747 diabetic patients enrolled in a trial of glibenclamide (CYP2C9, KCNJ11, TCF7L2, KCNQ1 and CDKN2A/2B gene). All the patients were followed for 48 weeks. Treatment failure was fasting blood glucose level>= 7.0   mmol/L. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between genetic variants and treatment failure over a period of 48 weeks. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC) and the multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MDR) analyses were used to assess the gene-gene interaction and also the predictive power of the combined variants. Results: The relationship beween risk alleles and FBG reduction at the end of the first month was not significant (Low Risk Group 10.8% (1.2-20.7%), Middle Risk Group 10.7% (1.3-21.1%), High Risk Group 8.51% (-   0.1-18.4%), P=0.212). After adjusting for sex, age, BMI, total dose of glibenclamide and baseline HbA1c, Cox regression showed a borderline significant association between the number of risk alleles and glibenclamide treatment failure (HR=1.125, 95%CI 1.016-1.246, P=0.023). There was potential gene-gene interaction between KCNJ11 and CDKN2A/2B gene using MDR method. The area under the ROC curve was 0.547, and the testing balanced accuracy of the best genetic model in MDR analysis was 0.5643. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the combined genetic variants were borderline significantly associated with the efficacy of glibenclamide, and there are gene-gene interaction between KCNJ11 and CDKN2A/2B. More evidence was needed for increasing the predictive value of genetic variants on glibenclamide efficacy.

27027642|t|Dissecting heterogeneity in paediatric Type 1 diabetes: association of TCF7L2 rs7903146 TT and low-risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes.
27027642|a|AIMS: To test the hypothesis that non-obese individuals with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes and the rs7903146 TT genotype would be less likely to have high-risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and alleles. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 105 non-obese participants in the T1D Exchange Biobank Residual Insulin Study who had childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes [mean (sd) age at onset and recruitment, respectively, 9.9 (4.15) and 14.4 (4.13) years; 84.8% non-Hispanic white]. We analysed islet autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell autoantigen 512/islet antigen-2 and zinc transporter 8), non-fasting random C-peptide levels, HLA type and TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in this cohort. RESULTS: None of the 13 individuals with the rs7903146 TT genotype carried the highest Type 1 diabetes risk HLA genotype, i.e. DRB1*03:01/DR4 (DRB1*0401, *04:05 or *04:02), compared with 29.4% (27/92) of those without it (P=0.023). The DRB1*03:01 allele was present in 15.4% (2/13) of individuals with the single nucleotide polymorphism, compared with 59.8% (55/92) of those without it (P=0.003). Analyses restricted to autoantibody-positive individuals (n=80) yielded similar results. The HLA DRB1*15:01 allele, which affords dominant protection against Type 1 diabetes, was found in one participant, who had multiple islet autoantibodies and carried the rs7903146 TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further support the hypothesis that TCF7L2 gene variation contributes to diabetogenesis in a subset of young people with Type 1 diabetes, opening possible new pathways for therapy and prevention.

27049325|t|Risk Alleles in/near ADCY5, ADRA2A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, GRB10, and TCF7L2 Elevate Plasma Glucose Levels at Birth and in Early Childhood: Results from the FAMILY Study.
27049325|a|BACKGROUND: Metabolic abnormalities that lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus begin in early childhood. OBJECTIVES: We investigate whether common genetic variants identified in adults have an effect on glucose in early life. METHODS: 610 newborns, 463 mothers, and 366 fathers were included in the present study. Plasma glucose and anthropometric characteristics were collected at birth, 3, and 5 years. After quality assessment, 37 SNPs, which have demonstrated an association with fasting plasma glucose at the genome-wide threshold in adults, were studied. Quantitative trait disequilibrium tests and mixed-effects regressions were conducted to estimate an effect of the SNPs on glucose. RESULTS: Risk alleles for 6 loci increased glucose levels from birth to 5 years of age (ADCY5, ADRA2A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, GRB10, and TCF7L2, 4.85x10-3 <=  P <=  4.60x10-2). Together, these 6 SNPs increase glucose by 0.05 mmol/L for each risk allele in a genotype score (P = 6.33x10-5). None of the associations described in the present study have been reported previously in early childhood. CONCLUSION: Our data support the notion that a subset of loci contributing to plasma glucose variation in adults has an effect at birth and in early life.

27053251|t|Association of genetic susceptibility variants for type 2 diabetes with breast cancer risk in women of European ancestry.
27053251|a|PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been reported to be associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. It is unclear, however, whether this association is due to shared genetic factors. METHODS: We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) using risk variants from 33 known independent T2D susceptibility loci and evaluated its relation to breast cancer risk using the data from two consortia, including 62,328 breast cancer patients and 83,817 controls of European ancestry. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to measure the association of breast cancer risk with T2D GRS or T2D-associated genetic risk variants. Meta-analyses were conducted to obtain summary ORs across all studies. RESULTS: The T2D GRS was not found to be associated with breast cancer risk, overall, by menopausal status, or for estrogen receptor positive or negative breast cancer. Three T2D associated risk variants were individually associated with breast cancer risk after adjustment for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method (at p < 0.001), rs9939609 (FTO) (OR 0.94, 95 % CI = 0.92-0.95, p = 4.13E-13), rs7903146 (TCF7L2) (OR 1.04, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.06, p = 1.26E-05), and rs8042680 (PRC1) (OR 0.97, 95 % CI = 0.95-0.99, p = 8.05E-04). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that several genetic risk variants were associated with the risk of both T2D and breast cancer. However, overall genetic susceptibility to T2D may not be related to breast cancer risk.

27058589|t|Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 Polymorphism as a Risk Factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis.
27058589|a|BACKGROUND: There are racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Prior meta-analyses included small samples and very limited non-Caucasian populations. Studies to determine the relationship between transcription factor 7 like-2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism and risk of GDM in Hispanics/Latinos are recently available. The present meta-analysis was to estimate the impact of allele variants of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism on GDM susceptibility in overall population and racial/ethnic subgroups. METHODS: Literature was searched in multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE (Ovid SP), Airiti Library, Medline Complete, and ProQuest up to July 2015. Allelic frequency for TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism in GDM and control subjects was extracted and statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) 2.0 statistical software. The association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and GDM risk was assessed by pooled odd ratios (ORs) using five gene models (dominant, recessive, homozygote, heterozygote, and allele). Stratified analysis based on race/ethnicity was also conducted. The between-study heterogeneity and contribution of each single study to the final result was tested by Cochran Q test and sensitivity analyses, respectively. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's linear regression test. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies involving 4,853 cases and 10,631 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Significant association between the T-allele of rs7903146 and GDM risk was observed under all genetic models, dominant model (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.19-1.74), recessive model (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.08-1.70), heterozygous model (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12-1.53), homozygous model (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.31-2.12), and allele model (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12-1.53). Stratified analysis by race/ethnicity showed a statistically significant association between rs7903146 polymorphism and susceptibility to GDM under homozygous genetic model (TT versus CC) among whites, Hispanics/Latinos and Asians. Sensitivity analysis showed that the overall findings were robust to potentially influential decisions of the 16 studies included. No significant evidence for publication bias was observed in this meta-analysis for overall studies and subgroup studies. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that the T allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility of GDM in overall population in white, Hispanic/Latino and Asian sub-groups. Asians with homozygous TT allele of rs7903146 polymorphism have highest risk of GDM (OR = 2.08) followed by Hispanics/Latinos (OR = 1.80) and whites (OR = 1.51). The highest and lowest frequency of T allele of rs7903146 was found in Malaysia and South Korea, respectively. Future studies are needed to profile genetic risk for GDM among high risk Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups.

27111116|t|Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes: It Matters From Which Parent We Inherit the Risk.
27111116|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from a co-occurrence of genes and environmental factors. There are more than 120 genetic loci suggested to be associated with T2D, or with glucose and insulin levels in European and multi-ethnic populations. Risk of T2D is higher in the offspring if the mother rather than the father has T2D. Genetically, this can be associated with a unique parent-of-origin (PoO) transmission of risk alleles, and it relates to genetic programming during the intrauterine period, resulting in the inability to increase insulin secretion in response to increased demands imposed by insulin resistance later in life. Such PoO transmission is seen for variants in the KLF14, KCNQ1, GRB10, TCF7L2, THADA, and PEG3 genes. Here we describe T2D susceptibility genes associated with defects in insulin secretion, and thereby risk of overt T2D. This review emphasizes the need to consider distorted parental transmission of risk alleles by exploring the genetic risk of T2D.

27121852|t|Computational analyses of type 2 diabetes-associated loci identified by genome-wide association studies.
27121852|a|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have discovered a number of loci that contribute to susceptibility to the disease. Future challenges include elucidation of functional mechanisms through which these GWAS-identified loci modulate T2D disease risk. The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize T2D associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes through computational approaches. METHODS: Computational biology approaches used in the present study included comparative genomic analyses and functional annotation using GWAS3D and RegulomeDB, investigation of the effects of T2D-associated SNPs on miRNA binding and protein phosphorylation, and gene ontology, pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional module analysis of T2D-associated genes from previously published GWAS. RESULTS: Computational analysis identified a number of T2D GWAS-associated SNPs that were located at protein binding sites, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A), transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and A2 (FOXA2), and potentially affected the binding of miRNAs and protein phosphorylation. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed two well-known maturity onset diabetes of the young and T2D pathways, whereas PPI network analysis identified highly interconnected "hub" genes, such as TCF7L2, melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B), and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 (SLC30A8), that created two tight subnetworks. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide objectives and clues for future experimental studies and further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T2D.

27159876|t|Current Understanding on Role of the Wnt Signaling Pathway Effector TCF7L2 in Glucose Homeostasis.
27159876|a|The role of the Wnt signaling pathway in metabolic homeostasis has drawn our intensive attention, especially after the genome-wide association study discovery that certain polymorphisms of its key effector TCF7L2 are strongly associated with the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For a decade, great efforts have been made in determining the function of TCF7L2 in various metabolic organs, which have generated both considerable achievements and disputes. In this review, I will briefly introduce the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, focusing on its effector b-catenin/TCF, including emphasizing the bidirectional feature of TCFs and b-catenin post-translational modifications. I will then summarize the observations on the association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes risk. The main content, however, is on the intensive functional exploration of the metabolic role of TCF7L2, including the disputes generated on determining its role in the pancreas and liver with various transgenic mouse lines. Finally, I will discuss those achievements and disputes and present my future perspectives.

27166975|t|Pharmacogenetic aspects of the treatment of Type 2 diabetes with the incretin effect enhancers.
27166975|a|Incretin effect enhancers are drugs used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and include GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins). Variants in several genes were shown to be involved in the physiology of incretin secretion. Only two gene variants have evidence also from pharmacogenetic studies. TCF7L2 rs7903146 C>T and CTRB1/2 rs7202877 T>G minor allele carriers were both associated with a smaller reduction in HbA1c after gliptin treatment when compared with major allele carriers. After replication in further studies, these observations could be of clinical significance in helping to identify patients with potentially lower or higher response to gliptin treatment.

27173344|t|Identification of trends in scientific publications related to genetic polymorphisms in gestational diabetes mellitus.
27173344|a|Gestational diabetes is a genetic multifactorial systemic disease that has been extensively studied. Consequently, there is a large volume of scientific literature pertaining to genes associated with gestational diabetes. The aim of this study was to characterize the main trends in scientific publications focusing on the associations between genetic polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The related articles were extracted from Scopus using the key words "genetic polymorphism" and "gestational diabetes mellitus"; the collected data focused on various fields (medical, biochemical, etc.) and included papers published within December 2013. One hundred and eighty-three relevant articles published between 1987 and 2013 were identified; we observed a significantly increasing trend in the number of publications pertaining to GDM. A majority of the articles focused on the medical (59.9%), biochemical, and genetics and molecular biological (29.6%) aspects of the disease. The genes coding for transcription factor 7-like 2 and glucokinase (TCF7L2, 29% and GCK, 28%) were predominantly studied and reported. This study helped quantify the growth in research pertaining to GDM; researchers from the USA have published a majority of the publications related to GDM. Several candidate genes have been linked to diabetes; however, the specific gene locus responsible for GDM has not yet been identified. The results of this study could help determine the orientation of future research on genetic factors associated with GDM.

27180666|t|[Pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetic treatment].
27180666|a|Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genes (individual genotypes) affect a persons response to drugs. At present, recommendations made about the treatment of some monogenic forms of diabetes are based on genetic diagnostics. The first studies in the field of pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetics have now been published which have identified associations of individual genetic variants with response to treatment. The response to sulfonylurea derivatives was significantly associated with the variants KCNJ11/ABCC8, TCF7L2 and CYP2C9. The response to metformin treatment was associated with the genetic variants ATM and SLC47A1. The response to treatment with glitazones was associated with the genetic variant PPARG. The therapeutic response to the treatment with gliptins was associated with the genetic variants TCF7L2 and CTRB1/2. It may be expected that in the near future pharmacogenetic knowledge will also be used within personalized treatment of type 2 diabetes.

27189021|t|Multi-ethnic genome-wide association study identifies novel locus for type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
27189021|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have traditionally been undertaken in homogeneous populations from the same ancestry group. However, with the increasing availability of GWAS in large-scale multi-ethnic cohorts, we have evaluated a framework for detecting association of genetic variants with complex traits, allowing for population structure, and developed a powerful test of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ancestry groups. We have applied the methodology to identify and characterise loci associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) using GWAS data from the Resource for Genetic Epidemiology on Adult Health and Aging, a large multi-ethnic population-based cohort, created for investigating the genetic and environmental basis of age-related diseases. We identified a novel locus for T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance (P<5 * 10(-8)) that maps to TOMM40-APOE, a region previously implicated in lipid metabolism and Alzheimer's disease. We have also confirmed previous reports that single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the TCF7L2 locus demonstrate the greatest extent of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups, with the lowest risk observed in populations of East Asian ancestry.

27207554|t|Improved Performance of Dynamic Measures of Insulin Response Over Surrogate Indices to Identify Genetic Contributors of Type 2 Diabetes: The GUARDIAN Consortium.
27207554|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disorder with contributions from peripheral insulin resistance and b-cell dysfunction. For minimization of phenotypic heterogeneity, quantitative intermediate phenotypes characterizing basal glucose homeostasis (insulin resistance and HOMA of insulin resistance [HOMAIR] and of b-cell function [HOMAB]) have shown promise in relatively large samples. We investigated the utility of dynamic measures of glucose homeostasis (insulin sensitivity [SI] and acute insulin response [AIRg]) evaluating T2D-susceptibility variants (n = 57) in Hispanic Americans from the GUARDIAN Consortium (n = 2,560). Basal and dynamic measures were genetically correlated (HOMAB-AIRg:   G = 0.28-0.73; HOMAIR-SI:   G = -0.73 to -0.83) with increased heritability for the dynamic measure AIRg Significant association of variants with dynamic measures (P < 8.77 * 10(-4)) was observed. A pattern of superior performance of AIRg was observed for well-established loci including MTNR1B (P = 9.46 * 10(-12)), KCNQ1 (P = 1.35 * 10(-4)), and TCF7L2 (P = 5.10 * 10(-4)) with study-wise statistical significance. Notably, significant association of MTNR1B with AIRg (P < 1.38 * 10(-9)) was observed in a population one-fourteenth the size of the initial discovery cohort. These observations suggest that basal and dynamic measures provide different views and levels of sensitivity to discrete elements of glucose homeostasis. Although more costly to obtain, dynamic measures yield significant results that could be considered physiologically "closer" to causal pathways and provide insight into the discrete mechanisms of action.

27230431|t|Rare intronic variants of TCF7L2 arising by selective sweeps in an indigenous population from Mexico.
27230431|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic variations of the TCF7L2 gene are associated with the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The associated mutations have demonstrated an adaptive role in some human populations, but no studies have determined the impact of evolutionary forces on genetic diversity in indigenous populations from Mexico. Here, we sequenced and analyzed the variation of the TCF7L2 gene in three Amerindian populations and compared the results with whole-exon-sequencing of Mestizo populations from Sigma and the 1000 Genomes Project to assess the roles of selection and recombination in diversity. RESULTS: The diversity in the indigenous populations was biased to intronic regions. Most of the variation was low frequency. Only mutations rs77961654 and rs61724286 were located on exon 15. We did not observe variation in intronic region 4-6 in any of the three indigenous populations. In addition, we identified peaks of selective sweeps in the mestizo samples from the Sigma Project within this region. By replicating the analysis of association with T2D between case-controls from the Sigma Project, we determined that T2D was most highly associated with the rs7903146 risk allele and to a lesser extent with the other six variants. All associated markers were located in intronic region 4-6, and their r(2) values of linkage disequilibrium were significantly higher in the Mexican population than in Africans from the 1000 Genomes Project. We observed reticulations in both the haplotypes network analysis from seven marker associates and the neighborNet tree based on 6061 markers in the TCF7L2 gene identified from all samples of the 1000 Genomes Project. Finally, we identified two recombination hotspots in the upstream region and 3' end of the TCF7L2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of diversity in intronic region 4-6 in Indigenous populations could be an effect of selective sweeps generated by the selection of neighboring rare variants at T2D-associated mutations. The survivors' variants make the intronic region 4-6 the area of the greatest population differentiation within the TCF7L2 gene. The abundance of selective peak sweeps in the downstream region of the TCF7L2 gene suggests that the TCF7L2 gene is part of a region that is in constant recombination between populations.

27253191|t|Association of type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci with peripheral nerve function in a Chinese population with diabetes.
27253191|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested a possible relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility loci and diabetic complications. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus loci with peripheral nerve function in a Chinese population with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,900 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were recruited in the study. We selected ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from ten type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility genes previously confirmed in Chinese patients. Genotyping was carried out by using a MassARRAY Compact Analyzer. Peripheral nerve function was evaluated by nerve conduction studies in all participants. The composite Z-scores for nerve conduction parameters including conduction velocity (CV), amplitude and latency were calculated, respectively. RESULTS: Rs5219 of KCNJ11 (E23K, G > A) was identified to be associated with all the parameters obtained from nerve conduction studies (Z-score of CV: b = 0.113, P = 0.01; Z-score of amplitude: b = 0.133, P = 0.01; Z-score of latency: b = -0.116, P = 0.01) after adjustment for covariates including age, duration and glycated hemoglobin. Specifically, each copy of the A allele was related to better outcomes. CDKAL1 rs7756992 and TCF7L2 rs7903146 correlated with the composite Z-score of amplitude (P = 0.028 and P = 0.016, respectively), but not CV (P = 0.393 and P = 0.281, respectively) or latency (P = 0.286 and P = 0.273, respectively). There were no significant associations between the other seven SNPs and peripheral nerve function. CONCLUSIONS: Rs5219 at KCNJ11 (E23K) was associated with peripheral nerve function in a Chinese population with type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting shared genetic factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic polyneuropathy in this population.

27281091|t|Genetic variants associated with lean and obese type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese population: A case-control study.
27281091|a|UNASSIGNED: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is highly phenotypically heterogeneous. Genetics of the heterogeneity of lean and obese T2D is not clear. The aim of the present study was to identify the associations of T2D-related genetic variants with the risks for lean and obese T2D among the Chinese Han population. A case-control study consisting of 5338 T2D patients and 4663 normal glycemic controls of Chinese Han recruited in the Chinese National Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Study was conducted. T2D cases were identified according to the 1999 World Health Organization criteria. Lean T2D was defined as T2D patient with a body mass index (BMI) <23kg/m, whereas obese T2D was defined as T2D patient with a BMI >= 28kg/m. Twenty-five genome-wide association studies previously validated T2D-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. A genotype risk score (GRS) based on the 25 SNPs was created. After adjusting for multiple covariates, SNPs in or near CDKAL1, CDKN2BAS, KCNQ1, TCF7L2, CDC123/CAMK1D, HHEX, and TCF2 were associated with the risk for lean T2D, and SNPs in or near KCNQ1 and FTO were associated with the risk for obese T2D. The results showed that the GRS for 25 T2D-related SNPs was more strongly associated with the risk for lean T2D (Ptrend = 2.66*10) than for obese T2D (Ptrend = 2.91*10) in our study population. Notably, the T2D GRS contributed to lower obesity-related measurements and greater b-cell dysfunction, including lower insulin levels in oral glucose tolerance test, decreased insulinogenic index, and Homeostasis Model Assessment for b-cell Function. In conclusion, our findings identified T2D-related genetic loci that contribute to the risk of lean and obese T2D individually and additively in a Chinese Han population. Moreover, the study highlights the contribution of known T2D genomic loci to the heterogeneity of lean and obese T2D in Chinese Hans.

27310578|t|Replication and Relevance of Multiple Susceptibility Loci Discovered from Genome Wide Association Studies for Type 2 Diabetes in an Indian Population.
27310578|a|AIM: Several genetic variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS) from Caucasian population; however replication studies were not consistent across various ethnicities. Objective of the current study is to examine the possible correlation of 9 most significant GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for T2D susceptibility as well as the interactive effect of these variants on the risk of T2D in an Indian population. METHODS: Case-control cohorts of 1156 individuals were genotyped for 9 SNPs from an Indian population. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression after adjusting for covariates. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was adopted to determine gene-gene interactions and discriminatory power of combined SNP effect was assessed by grouping individuals based on the number of risk alleles and by calculating area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: We confirm the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and SLC30A8 (rs13266634) with T2D. MDR analysis showed statistically significant interactions among four SNPs of SLC30A8 (rs13266634), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), HHEX (rs1111875) and CDKN2A (rs10811661) genes. Cumulative analysis showed an increase in odds ratio against the baseline group of individuals carrying 5 to 6 risk alleles and discriminatory power of genetic test based on 9 variants showed higher AUC value when analyzed along with body mass index (BMI). CONCLUSION: These results provide a strong evidence for independent association between T2D and SNPs for in TCF7L2 and SLC30A8. MDR analysis demonstrates that independently non-significant variants may interact with one another resulting in increased disease susceptibility in the population tested.

27323175|t|Association between transcription factor 7-like 2 genetic polymorphisms and development of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population.
27323175|a|UNASSIGNED: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate the relationship between the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in a Chinese population. Genotyping of TCF7L2 rs7903146 was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. A chi-square test revealed a statistically significant difference between the distributions of rs7903146 genotypes in type 2 diabetes mellitus patient and control groups (chi-square = 10.49, P = 0.005). Using unconditional logistic regression analysis, we observed that the TT genotype of this polymorphism was significantly correlated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to the CC genotype [odds ratio (OR) = 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33-4.04]. Furthermore, we found that the rs7903146 sequence variation was also significantly associated with susceptibility to this disease under dominant (OR = 1.58, 95%CI = 1.09-2.28) and recessive models   (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.25-3.62). We conclude that the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genetic polymorphism is independently associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus under co-dominant, dominant, and recessive models.

27344314|t|Novel phenotypes of prediabetes?
27344314|a|This article describes phenotypes observed in a prediabetic population (i.e. a population with increased risk for type 2 diabetes) from data collected at the University hospital of T  bingen. We discuss the impact of genetic variation on insulin secretion, in particular the effect on compensatory hypersecretion, and the incretin-resistant phenotype of carriers of the gene variant TCF7L2 is described. Imaging studies used to characterise subphenotypes of fat distribution, metabolically healthy obesity and metabolically unhealthy obesity are described. Also discussed are ectopic fat stores in liver and pancreas that determine the phenotype of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fatty liver and the recently recognised phenotype of fatty pancreas. The metabolic impact of perivascular adipose tissue and pancreatic fat is discussed. The role of hepatokines, particularly that of fetuin-A, in the crosstalk between these organs is described. Finally, the role of brain insulin resistance in the development of the different prediabetes phenotypes is discussed.

27721485|t|The anti-hyperglycemic efficacy of a lipid-lowering drug Daming capsule and the underlying signaling mechanisms in a rat model of diabetes mellitus.
27721485|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder manifested by hyperglycemia. Daming Capsule (DMC), a combination of traditional Chinese herbs, is used clinically as a lipid-lowering drug. This study was designed to evaluate if DMC possesses an anti-hyperglycemic effect and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Compared to diabetic rats, the rats received DMC (200   mg/kg/d) had significantly lower blood lipid and glucose levels. DMC markedly restored the decreased secretion of GLP-1 and GIP as well as the coding gene GCG and GIP in ileum. Moreover, DMC normalized depressed GCG and GIP transcription by significantly enhancing the GSK-3b/b-catenin signaling pathway and expression of TCF7L2, a transactivator of GCG and GIP in diabetic rats. DMC possesses an anti-hyperglycemic property characterized by preservation/stimulation of GLP-1 and GIP secretion in DM rats. Here, we proposed DMC    >    GSK-3b/b-catenin  -    >    TCF7L2  -    >    GLP-1, GIP secretion  -    >    blood glucose    as a regulatory pathway of blood glucose homeostasis. Our findings suggest DMC as a promising therapeutic drug in the clinical treatment of diabetes.

27758844|t|Impact of the TCF7L2 genotype on risk of hypoglycaemia and glucagon secretion during hypoglycaemia.
27758844|a|INTRODUCTION: In healthy carriers of the T allele of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), fasting plasma glucagon concentrations are lower compared with those with the C allele. We hypothesised that presence of the T allele is associated with a diminished glucagon response during hypoglycaemia and a higher frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (SH) in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a post hoc study of an earlier prospective observational study of SH and four mechanistic studies of physiological responses to hypoglycaemia. 269 patients with T1DM were followed in a one-year observational study. A log-linear negative binomial model was applied with events of SH as dependent variable and TCF7L2 alleles as explanatory variable. In four experimental studies including 65 people, TCF7L2 genotyping was done and plasma glucagon concentration during experimental hypoglycaemia was determined. RESULTS: Incidences of SH were TT 0.54, TC 0.98 and CC 1.01 episodes per patient-year with no significant difference between groups. During experimental hypoglycaemia, the TCF7L2 polymorphism did not influence glucagon secretion. DISCUSSION: Patients with T1DM carrying the T allele of the TCF7L2 polymorphism do not exhibit diminished glucagon response during hypoglycaemia and are not at increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia compared with carriers of the C allele.

27777306|t|A Critical Role for b-Catenin in Modulating Levels of Insulin Secretion from b-Cells by Regulating Actin Cytoskeleton and Insulin Vesicle Localization.
27777306|a|UNASSIGNED: The processes regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and its modulation by incretins in pancreatic b-cells are only partly understood. Here we investigate the involvement of b-catenin in these processes. Reducing b-catenin levels using siRNA knockdown attenuated GSIS in a range of b-cell models and blocked the ability of GLP-1 agonists and the depolarizing agent KCl to potentiate this. This could be mimicked in both b-cell models and isolated islets by short-term exposure to the b-catenin inhibitory drug pyrvinium. In addition, short-term treatment with a drug that increases b-catenin levels results in an increase in insulin secretion. The timing of these effects suggests that b-catenin is required for the processes regulating trafficking and/or release of pre-existing insulin granules rather than for those regulated by gene expression. This was supported by the finding that the overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator of b-catenin, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), attenuated insulin secretion, consistent with the extra TCF7L2 translocating b-catenin from the plasma membrane pool to the nucleus. We show that b-catenin depletion disrupts the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, and by using total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that b-catenin is required for the glucose- and incretin-induced depletion of insulin vesicles from near the plasma membrane. In conclusion, we find that b-catenin levels modulate Ca(2+)-dependent insulin exocytosis under conditions of glucose, GLP-1, or KCl stimulation through a role in modulating insulin secretory vesicle localization and/or fusion via actin remodeling. These findings also provide insights as to how the overexpression of TCF7L2 may attenuate insulin secretion.

27792933|t|Association between the TCF7L2 polymorphism and colorectal cancer does not differ by diabetes and obesity statuses.
27792933|a|This study evaluated the association between polymorphism in a newly identified locus, rs11196172, located in transcription factors 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk according to diabetes and obesity statuses. A study enrolled 6138 CRC patients and 4367 community controls. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with age, sex, smoking, and body mass index of the A allele, compared with the G allele, was 1.08 (95% CI 1.01-1.16). The significantly higher risk of CRC with the A allele remained after adjusting for diabetic status (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.15). When stratified by diabetic or obesity status, significant associations between TCF7L2 polymorphism and CRC risk were limited to non-diabetic or normal-weight subjects. No significant interactions between the A/G allele and diabetes status or the A/G allele and overweight status were found. The results indicated that the TCF7L2 rs11196172 polymorphism increases the risk of CRC independently, with no evidence of an interaction with diabetes or obesity.

27796421|t|HDAC7 is overexpressed in human diabetic islets and impairs insulin secretion in rat islets and clonal beta cells.
27796421|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pancreatic beta cell dysfunction is a prerequisite for the development of type 2 diabetes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) may affect pancreatic endocrine function and glucose homeostasis through alterations in gene regulation. Our aim was to investigate the role of HDAC7 in human and rat pancreatic islets and clonal INS-1 beta cells (INS-1   832/13). METHODS: To explore the role of HDAC7 in pancreatic islets and clonal beta cells, we used RNA sequencing, mitochondrial functional analyses, microarray techniques, and HDAC inhibitors MC1568 and trichostatin A. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing, we found increased HDAC7 expression in human pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic donors. HDAC7 expression correlated negatively with insulin secretion in human islets. To mimic the situation in type 2 diabetic islets, we overexpressed Hdac7 in rat islets and clonal beta cells. In both, Hdac7 overexpression resulted in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, it reduced insulin content, mitochondrial respiration and cellular ATP levels in clonal beta cells. Overexpression of Hdac7 also led to changes in the genome-wide gene expression pattern, including increased expression of Tcf7l2 and decreased expression of gene sets regulating DNA replication and repair as well as nucleotide metabolism. In accordance, Hdac7 overexpression reduced the number of beta cells owing to enhanced apoptosis. Finally, we found that inhibiting HDAC7 activity with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta cells that were overexpressing Hdac7. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these results indicate that increased HDAC7 levels caused beta cell dysfunction and may thereby contribute to defects seen in type 2 diabetic islets. Our study supports HDAC7 inhibitors as a therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

27929407|t|Polymorphism of the Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Gene (TCF7L2) Interacts with Obesity on Type-2 Diabetes in the PREDIMED Study Emphasizing the Heterogeneity of Genetic Variants in Type-2 Diabetes Risk Prediction: Time for Obesity-Specific Genetic Risk Scores.
27929407|a|UNASSIGNED: Nutrigenetic studies analyzing gene-diet interactions of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 C > T polymorphism on type-2 diabetes (T2D) have shown controversial results. A reason contributing to this may be the additional modulation by obesity. Moreover, TCF7L2-rs7903146 is one of the most influential variants in T2D-genetic risk scores (GRS). Therefore, to increase the predictive value (PV) of GRS it is necessary to first see whether the included polymorphisms have heterogeneous effects. We comprehensively investigated gene-obesity interactions between the TCF7L2-rs7903146 C > T polymorphism on T2D (prevalence and incidence) and analyzed other T2D-polymorphisms in a sub-sample. We studied 7018 PREDIMED participants at baseline and longitudinally (8.7 years maximum follow-up). Obesity significantly interacted with the TCF7L2-rs7903146 on T2D prevalence, associations being greater in non-obese subjects. Accordingly, we prospectively observed in non-T2D subjects (n = 3607) that its association with T2D incidence was stronger in non-obese (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.13-2.92, p = 0.013 for TT versus CC) than in obese subjects (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.61-1.66; p = 0.979; p-interaction = 0.048). Accordingly, TCF7L2-PV was higher in non-obese subjects. Additionally, we created obesity-specific GRS with ten T2D-polymorphisms and demonstrated for the first time their higher strata-specific PV. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence supporting the need for considering obesity when analyzing the TCF7L2 effects and propose the use of obesity-specific GRS for T2D.

27958319|t|Altered DNA methylation associated with an abnormal liver phenotype in a cattle model with a high incidence of perinatal pathologies.
27958319|a|Cloning enables the generation of both clinically normal and pathological individuals from the same donor cells, and may therefore be a DNA sequence-independent driver of phenotypic variability. We took advantage of cattle clones with identical genotypes but different developmental abilities to investigate the role of epigenetic factors in perinatal mortality, a complex trait with increasing prevalence in dairy cattle. We studied livers from pathological clones dying during the perinatal period, clinically normal adult clones with the same genotypes as perinatal clones and conventional age-matched controls. The livers from deceased perinatal clones displayed histological lesions, modifications to quantitative histomorphometric and metabolic parameters such as glycogen storage and fatty acid composition, and an absence of birth-induced maturation. In a genome-wide epigenetic analysis, we identified DNA methylation patterns underlying these phenotypic alterations and targeting genes relevant to liver metabolism, including the type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2. The adult clones were devoid of major phenotypic and epigenetic abnormalities in the liver, ruling out the effects of genotype on the phenotype observed. These results thus provide the first demonstration of a genome-wide association between DNA methylation and perinatal mortality in cattle, and highlight epigenetics as a driving force for phenotypic variability in farmed animals.

27958632|t|Association between rs7901695 and rs7903146 polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene and gestational diabetes in the population of Southern Poland.
27958632|a|OBJECTIVES: The etiology of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains to be fully elucidated. Elevated risk for type 2 diabetes in patients with history of GDM and for GDM in women with familial history of diabetes may suggest that GDM and type 2 diabetes share a common genetic and environmental background. The TCF7L2 (Transcription Factor 7 Like 2) gene is one of the most important genetic factors of the established correlation with type 2 diabetes, and it may also play a role in the pathophysiology of GDM. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of two polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene (rs7901695 and rs7903146), which are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, in women with GDM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 50 women with glucose tolerance disorders diagnosed for the first time during the current pregnancy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using allelic discrimination. The results were confirmed using the sequencing method. Selected clinical parameters were also analyzed. RESULTS: No correlation between the studied polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene and GDM was observed. Glycemic control with diet or diet and insulin was associated with better control of the weight gain during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: No correlation between rs7903146 and rs7901695 polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene and GDM was found. Glycemic control with diet or diet and insulin is associated with better control of the weight gain during pregnancy.

27983772|t|Metabolic Response to Olanzapine in Healthy Chinese Subjects with rs7093146 Polymorphism in Transcription Factor 7-like 2 Gene (TCF7L2): A Prospective Study.
27983772|a|Olanzapine is a widely used atypical antipsychotic with significant weight gain and other metabolic side effects. The locus of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The goal of this study was to determine whether polymorphic TCF7L2 is involved in the susceptibility to the metabolic changes associated with the atypical antipsychotic agents (AAPs). In this study, a parallel clinical study with 3-day consecutive administration of olanzapine (10 mg/day) was conducted in 17 healthy subjects with a genotype of TCF7L2 rs7903146 CC (N = 10) or CT (N = 7). Olanzapine caused rapid metabolic changes including body-weight gain, increased triglycerides level and reduced HDL-cholesterol level in the healthy subjects. rs7093146 T carriers (CT) were found to have greater AUC<sub>0-2 hr</sub>of insulin during OGTT compared to those (CC) bearing only reference alleles before and after olanzapine treatment. However, the triglyceride level in the subjects with the CT genotype was found to be significantly lower than that in the subjects with CC genotype. Moreover, a significant interaction between the effect by genotype and that by olanzapine treatment on triglyceride level was identified. Acute olanzapine treatment also significantly caused total protein, albumin and haemoglobin decrease and uric acid increase in the healthy subjects. In conclusion, even acute olanzapine treatment induces significant and rapid metabolic changes, and TCF7L2 polymorphism is a genetic risk factor of olanzapine-associated metabolic side effects.

27998387|t|Association of TCF7L2 and GCG Gene Variants with Insulin Secretion, Insulin Resistance, and Obesity in New-onset Diabetes.
27998387|a|This cohort study was designed to evaluate the association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and proglucagon gene (GCG) variants with disordered glucose metabolism and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural adult Chinese population. A total of 7,751 non-T2DM participants    18 years old genotyped at baseline were recruited. The same questionnaire interview and physical and blood biochemical examinations were performed at both baseline and follow-up. During a median 6 years of follow-up, T2DM developed in 227 participants. After adjustment for potential contributory factors, nominally significant associations were seen between TT genotype and the recessive model of TCF7L2 rs7903146 and increased risk of T2DM [hazard ratio (HR)=4.068, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.270-13.026; HR=4.051, 95% CI: 1.268-12.946, respectively]. The TT genotype of rs7903146 was also significantly associated with higher fasting plasma insulin level and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in case of new-onset diabetes. In addition, the TCF7L2 rs290487 TT genotype was associated with abdominal obesity and the GCG rs12104705 CC genotype was associated with both general obesity and abdominal obesity in case of new-onset diabetes.

28002648|t|Association between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis.
28002648|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Studies have been carried out to evaluate the correlation between TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. However, the conclusions from these studies are incomplete, because partial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. We carried out a meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and GDM susceptibility in all population and racial/ethnic subgroups to afford a foundation for future research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published studies censoring TCF7L2 variants and GDM risk were captured from the EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI and Wanfang databases. The meta-analysis was processed using software of RevMan 5.2 and Stata13. The relationship between TCF7L2 polymorphism and GDM occurrence was evaluated by pooled odds ratios. Stratified analysis based on race/ethnicity was also carried out. The allele-specific odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were counted, and based on homogeneity evaluated using the I2 -test, fixed- or random-effects pooled measures were selected. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were covered, capturing eight TCF7L2 SNPs and involving 5,573 cases and 13,266 controls. Six of eight SNPs showed significant relationships with GDM occurrence, of which the SNPs rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs7901695 were the most powerful. Stratified analysis by race/ethnicity showed discrepant results in these three SNPs. In Caucasians and other races, all these SNPs were found to have a significant association with GDM risk, but in Asians, only SNP rs7903146 showed a significant association. CONCLUSIONS: Six of eight SNPs were found to have significant associations between TCF7L2 variants and GDM risk in the overall population, with the most powerful in SNPs being rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs7901695, but the contribution of these SNPs to GDM risk were variable among different racial/ethnic groups.

28040731|t|Quantifying the extent to which index event biases influence large genetic association studies.
28040731|a|As genetic association studies increase in size to 100  000s of individuals, subtle biases may influence conclusions. One possible bias is 'index event bias' (IEB) that appears due to the stratification by, or enrichment for, disease status when testing associations between genetic variants and a disease-associated trait. We aimed to test the extent to which IEB influences some known trait associations in a range of study designs and provide a statistical framework for assessing future associations. Analyzing data from 113  203 non-diabetic UK Biobank participants, we observed three (near TCF7L2, CDKN2AB and CDKAL1) overestimated (body mass index (BMI) decreasing) and one (near MTNR1B) underestimated (BMI increasing) associations among 11 type 2 diabetes risk alleles (at P    <    0.05). IEB became even stronger when we tested a type 2 diabetes genetic risk score composed of these 11 variants (-0.010 standard deviations BMI per allele, P    =    5   *   10-   4), which was confirmed in four additional independent studies. Similar results emerged when examining the effect of blood pressure increasing alleles on BMI in normotensive UK Biobank samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, under realistic scenarios, common disease alleles would become associated at P   <    5 * 10-   8 with disease-related traits through IEB alone, if disease prevalence in the sample differs appreciably from the background population prevalence. For example, some hypertension and type 2 diabetes alleles will be associated with BMI in sample sizes of    >500  000 if the prevalence of those diseases differs by   >10% from the background population. In conclusion, IEB may result in false positive or negative genetic associations in very large studies stratified or strongly enriched for/against disease cases.

28052964|t|Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of Human Pancreatic Islets Reveals Novel Differentially Methylated Regions in Type 2 Diabetes Pathogenesis.
28052964|a|Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified 25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs. We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1, SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets, candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured b-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA methylation in different genomic regions and of different transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and T2D pathogenesis.

28060743|t|2017 update on the relationship between diabetes and colorectal cancer: epidemiology, potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications.
28060743|a|Worldwide deaths from diabetes mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer increased by 90% and 57%, respectively, over the past 20 years. The risk of colorectal cancer was estimated to be 27% higher in patients with type 2 DM than in non-diabetic controls. However, there are potential confounders, information from lower income countries is scarce, across the globe there is no correlation between DM prevalence and colorectal cancer incidence and the association has evolved over time, suggesting the impact of additional environmental factors. The clinical relevance of these associations depends on understanding the mechanism involved. Although evidence is limited, insulin use has been associated with increased and metformin with decreased incidence of colorectal cancer. In addition, colorectal cancer shares some cellular and molecular pathways with diabetes target organ damage, exemplified by diabetic kidney disease. These include epithelial cell injury, activation of inflammation and Wnt/b-catenin pathways and iron homeostasis defects, among others. Indeed, some drugs have undergone clinical trials for both cancer and diabetic kidney disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified diabetes-associated genes (e.g. TCF7L2) that may also contribute to colorectal cancer. We review the epidemiological evidence, potential pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic implications of the association between DM and colorectal cancer. Further studies should clarify the worldwide association between DM and colorectal cancer, strengthen the biological plausibility of a cause-and-effect relationship through characterization of the molecular pathways involved, search for specific molecular signatures of colorectal cancer under diabetic conditions, and eventually explore DM-specific strategies to prevent or treat colorectal cancer.

30647622|t|Common variants in TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 genes and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Egyptians.
30647622|a|In this work we studied association of common variants in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) genes with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Egyptians. Subjects and methods: This is a case-control study; 180 T2DM patients and 210 control subjects were genotyped for TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs12255372 and CDKAL1 rs7756992 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by TaqMan method on real time polymerase chain reaction system (real time-PCR). Results: TCF7L2 rs12255372 and rs7903146 associated with T2DM (p  =  0.0001 and 0.003; respectively). The rs12255372 variant T allele associated with 2-fold increased risk for T2DM and TT genotype carriers were at 3.58-folds higher risk to develop T2DM than wild genotype (GG) carriers. Meanwhile, rs7903146 variant T allele associated with 1.6-fold increased risk for T2DM and TT genotype carriers were at 2.3-folds higher risk than wild genotype (CC) carriers. Both TCF7L2 SNPs significantly associated with T2DM under additive and dominant models and after adjustment for other covariates. On the other hand, CDKAL1 rs7756992 showed no significant association with T2DM under any genetic model. Both TCF7L2 SNPs were in strong LD (P  =  0.02; D'  =  0.85). Taking common TCF7L2 rs12255372/rs7903146 GC haplotype as reference, multivariate analysis confirmed the association of rs12255372 T allele-containing haplotypes (TC and TT) with T2DM. Haplotype TC associated with 6.32 times-higher risk for T2DM (95%CI  =  0.55-76.17, Pc  =  0.04) followed by haplotype TT which associated with 3.88 times-higher risk for the disease (95%CI  =  1.09-13.76, Pc  =  0.03). Conclusion: TCF7L2 rs12255372 and rs7903146 common variants associate with T2DM risk in Egyptians.

28067832|t|Type 2 Diabetes Susceptibility in the Greek-Cypriot Population: Replication of Associations with TCF7L2, FTO, HHEX, SLC30A8 and IGF2BP2 Polymorphisms.
28067832|a|UNASSIGNED: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been the subject of numerous genetic studies in recent years which revealed associations of the disease with a large number of susceptibility loci. We hereby initiate the evaluation of T2D susceptibility loci in the Greek-Cypriot population by performing a replication case-control study. One thousand and eighteen individuals (528 T2D patients, 490 controls) were genotyped at 21 T2D susceptibility loci, using the allelic discrimination method. Statistically significant associations of T2D with five of the tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (TCF7L2 rs7901695, FTO rs8050136, HHEX rs5015480, SLC30A8 rs13266634 and IGF2BP2 rs4402960) were observed in this study population. Furthermore, 14 of the tested SNPs had odds ratios (ORs) in the same direction as the previously published studies, suggesting that these variants can potentially be used in the Greek-Cypriot population for predictive testing of T2D. In conclusion, our findings expand the genetic assessment of T2D susceptibility loci and reconfirm five of the worldwide established loci in a distinct, relatively small, newly investigated population.

28072873|t|Association Study with 77 SNPs Confirms the Robust Role for the rs10830963/G of MTNR1B Variant and Identifies Two Novel Associations in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Development.
28072873|a|CONTEXT: Genetic variation in human maternal DNA contributes to the susceptibility for development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). OBJECTIVE: We assessed 77 maternal single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) for associations with GDM or plasma glucose levels at OGTT in pregnancy. METHODS: 960 pregnant women (after dropouts 820: case/control: m99'WHO: 303/517, IADPSG: 287/533) were enrolled in two countries into this case-control study. After genomic DNA isolation the 820 samples were collected in a GDM biobank and assessed using KASP (LGC Genomics) genotyping assay. Logistic regression risk models were used to calculate ORs according to IADPSG/m'99WHO criteria based on standard OGTT values. RESULTS: The most important risk alleles associated with GDM were rs10830963/G of MTNR1B (OR = 1.84/1.64 [IADPSG/m'99WHO], p = 0.0007/0.006), rs7754840/C (OR = 1.51/NS, p = 0.016) of CDKAL1 and rs1799884/T (OR = 1.4/1.56, p = 0.04/0.006) of GCK. The rs13266634/T (SLC30A8, OR = 0.74/0.71, p = 0.05/0.02) and rs7578326/G (LOC646736/IRS1, OR = 0.62/0.60, p = 0.001/0.006) variants were associated with lower risk to develop GDM. Carrying a minor allele of rs10830963 (MTNR1B); rs7903146 (TCF7L2); rs1799884 (GCK) SNPs were associated with increased plasma glucose levels at routine OGTT. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the robust association of MTNR1B rs10830963/G variant with GDM binary and glycemic traits in this Caucasian case-control study. As novel associations we report the minor, G allele of the rs7578326 SNP in the LOC646736/IRS1 region as a significant and the rs13266634/T SNP (SLC30A8) as a suggestive protective variant against GDM development. Genetic susceptibility appears to be more preponderant in individuals who meet both the modified 99'WHO and the IADPSG GDM diagnostic criteria.

28101933|t|Associations of common variants in the SLC16A11, TCF7L2, and ABCA1 genes with pediatric-onset type 2 diabetes and related glycemic traits in families: A case-control and case-parent trio study.
28101933|a|BACKGROUND: There is evidence of associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits in adults, but there is a little information about such associations in youths. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of SNPs in the TCF7L2, SLC16A11, and ABCA1 genes with T2D and related glycemic traits in Mexican children and adolescents. SUBJECTS: A total of 99 families with children with T2D (n   =   327) and 83 families with children without the disease (n   =   212). METHODS: The associations between SNPs of TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), SLC16A11 (rs13342232), and ABCA1 (rs9282541) with T2D were analyzed. We also evaluated the effects of SNPs on quantitatively related glycemic traits after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of overweight or obesity. RESULTS: The G allele of SLC16A1 /rs13342232 was associated with T2D in adults (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]   =   1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18; 3.06) and children (ORadj   =   1.94; 95% CI: 1.25; 3.00). In addition, the combined analysis of case-control and case-parent trio was also significant (OR   =   1.43; 95% CI: 1.12; 1.74). After adjusting for known confounding factors, we found a significant association between TCF7L2/rs122555372 and C-peptide (b   =   -0.76, P   =   .005) in patients with diabetes and between fasting glucose (b   =   2.05, P   =   .039) and homeostatic model assessment of b-cell function (b   =   -32.14, P   =   .025) levels in individuals without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SLC16A1 /rs13342232 might be involved in the risk of pediatric-onset T2D in Mexican families. Moreover, TCF7L2/rs122555372 was associated with pancreatic reserve in patients with T2D and with fasting glucose and b-cell function in individuals without diabetes.

28102847|t|Curcumin represses mouse 3T3-L1 cell adipogenic differentiation via inhibiting miR-17-5p and stimulating the Wnt signalling pathway effector Tcf7l2.
28102847|a|UNASSIGNED: Understanding mechanisms underlying adipogenic differentiation may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for obesity. Wnt signalling pathway activation leads to repressed adipogenic differentiation while certain microRNAs may regulate pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. We show here that in mouse white adipose tissue, miR-17-5p level is elevated after high fat diet consumption. miR-17-5p upregulates adipogenic differentiation, as its over-expression increased while its inhibition repressed 3T3-L1 differentiation. The Tcf7l2 gene encodes a key Wnt signalling pathway effector, and its human homologue TCF7L2 is a highly regarded diabetes risk gene. We found that Tcf7l2 is an miR-17-5p target and confirmed the repressive effect of Tcf7l2 on 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation. The natural plant polyphenol compound curcumin possesses the body weight lowering effect. We observed that curcumin attenuated miR-17-5p expression and stimulated Tcf7l2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells. These, along with the elevation of miR-17-5p expression in mouse epididymal fat tissue in response to high fat diet consumption, allowed us to suggest that miR-17-5p is among central switches of adipogenic differentiation. It activates adipogenesis via repressing the Wnt signalling pathway effector Tcf7l2, and its own expression is likely nutritionally regulated in health and disease.

28117839|t|The genetic overlap between mood disorders and cardiometabolic diseases: a systematic review of genome wide and candidate gene studies.
28117839|a|Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWASs) and candidate gene studies have identified genetic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and mood disorders. Although previous efforts were successful for individual disease conditions (single disease), limited information exists on shared genetic risk between these disorders. This article presents a detailed review and analysis of cardiometabolic diseases risk (CMD-R) genes that are also associated with mood disorders. First, we reviewed meta-GWASs published until January 2016, for the diseases 'type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension' and/or for the risk factors 'blood pressure, obesity, plasma lipid levels, insulin and glucose related traits'. We then searched the literature for published associations of these CMD-R genes with mood disorders. We considered studies that reported a significant association of at least one of the CMD-R genes and 'depression' or 'depressive disorder' or 'depressive symptoms' or 'bipolar disorder' or 'lithium treatment response in bipolar disorder', or 'serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment response in major depression'. Our review revealed 24 potential pleiotropic genes that are likely to be shared between mood disorders and CMD-Rs. These genes include MTHFR, CACNA1D, CACNB2, GNAS, ADRB1, NCAN, REST, FTO, POMC, BDNF, CREB, ITIH4, LEP, GSK3B, SLC18A1, TLR4, PPP1R1B, APOE, CRY2, HTR1A, ADRA2A, TCF7L2, MTNR1B and IGF1. A pathway analysis of these genes revealed significant pathways: corticotrophin-releasing hormone signaling, AMPK signaling, cAMP-mediated or G-protein coupled receptor signaling, axonal guidance signaling, serotonin or dopamine receptors signaling, dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cAMP signaling, circadian rhythm signaling and leptin signaling. Our review provides insights into the shared biological mechanisms of mood disorders and cardiometabolic diseases.

28133617|t|Molecular Analysis of a Genetic Variants Panel Related to Nutrients and Metabolism: Association with Susceptibility to Gestational Diabetes and Cardiometabolic Risk in Affected Women.
28133617|a|UNASSIGNED: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent metabolic disorder in pregnancy. Women with a GDM history are at increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between several genes involved in the metabolic pathway of insulin and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical parameters in GDM and variants in genes involved with nutrients and metabolism. Several variants PPARG2 rs1801282 (C>G); PPARGC1A rs8192678 (C>T); TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C>T); LDLR rs2228671 (C>T); MTHFR rs1801133 (C>T); APOA5 rs662799 (T>C); GCKR rs1260326 (C>T); FTO rs9939609 (T>A); MC4R rs17782313 (T>C) were genotyped in 168 pregnant Caucasian women with or without GDM by High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. A significant correlation was observed between TT genotype of TCF7L2 gene and increased risk of GDM (OR 5.4 [95% CI 1.5-19.3]). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and genetic variations in additional genes, namely, PPARG2 [p = 0,02], APOA5 [p = 0,02], MC4R [p = 0,03], LDLR [p = 0,01], and FTO [p = 0,02]. Our findings support the association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant and an increased GDM risk. Results about the investigated genetic variants provide important information about cardiometabolic risk in GDM and help to plan future prevention studies.

28139539|t|Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus genes in polycystic ovary syndrome aetiology among women from southern India.
28139539|a|BACKGROUND _ OBJECTIVES: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder of premenopausal women. Given the phenotypic overlap between PCOS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), this study was carried out to investigate whether genes implicated in T2DM were also involved in the susceptibility to PCOS among women from southern India. METHODS: A total of 248 women with PCOS and 210 healthy women as controls were genotyped for a panel of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nine T2DM genes, such as TCF7L2, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A, IRS1, CAPN10 and PPARG, on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. RESULTS: None of the 15 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with PCOS after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, either in the univariate or multivariate context. The cumulative effect of risk alleles observed with reference to T2DM was also not seen with reference to PCOS. INTERPRETATION _ CONCLUSIONS: The nine T2DM genes considered in this exploratory study might not be the primary susceptibility factors for PCOS among Indian women. Our results supplement the lack of evidence of the association of T2DM genes with PCOS among the Chinese and Caucasians hinting at the possible universality of this pattern. Specifically designed comprehensive studies that include women with T2DM and PCOS are required to explore the precise role of the diabetes genes.

28183453|t|Glucose tolerance and free fatty acid metabolism in adults with variations in TCF7L2 rs7903146.
28183453|a|OBJECTIVE: TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes. We investigated the effect of TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 and glucose tolerance on free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 120 individuals, half homozygous for the major CC allele and half homozygous for the minor TT allele at rs7903146; each underwent a 2-h, 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acid concentrations were measured on blood collected before and during the OGTT. RESULTS: Total FFA concentrations and percent FA species during OGTT were not different in CC and TT carriers when males and females were considered together. However, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) concentrations and percentages were greater in TT than CC females during the OGTT. TT carriers with high HOMA-IR had significantly greater fasting FFA concentrations, lower disposition index (DI) and greater AUC of glucose than high HOMA-IR CC carriers, whereas no such differences were observed in the low HOMA-IR group. We found that fasting (826  25 vs. 634  22 mol/L, P<0.0001) and OGTT plasma FFA concentrations were greater in IGT than NGT subjects, and the difference remained after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and genotype. Finally, IGT subjects had greater MUFA concentrations and percentages than NGT subjects during OGTT. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar fasting insulin and glucose, fasting plasma FFA are greater in IGT than NGT adults. Insulin resistance and sex influence plasma FFA responses amongst carriers of the minor T allele of TCF7L2 rs7903146.

28219675|t|Tcf7l2 plays crucial roles in forebrain development through regulation of thalamic and habenular neuron identity and connectivity.
28219675|a|The thalamus acts as a central integrator for processing and relaying sensory and motor information to and from the cerebral cortex, and the habenula plays pivotal roles in emotive decision making by modulating dopaminergic and serotonergic circuits. These neural compartments are derived from a common developmental progenitor domain, called prosomere 2, in the caudal forebrain. Thalamic and habenular neurons exhibit distinct molecular profile, neurochemical identity, and axonal circuitry. However, the mechanisms of how their progenitors in prosomere 2 give rise to these two populations of neurons and contribute to the forebrain circuitry remains unclear. In this study, we discovered a previously unrecognized role for Tcf7l2, a transcription factor known as the canonical Wnt nuclear effector and diabetes risk-conferring gene, in establishing neuronal identity and circuits of the caudal forebrain. Using genetic and chemical axon tracers, we showed that efferent axons of the thalamus, known as the thalamocortical axons (TCAs), failed to elongate normally and strayed from their normal course to inappropriate locations in the absence of Tcf7l2. Further experiments with thalamic explants revealed that the pathfinding defects of Tcf7l2-deficient TCAs were associated at least in part with downregulation of guidance receptors Robo1 and Robo2 expression. Moreover, the fasciculus retroflexus, the main habenular output tract, was missing in embryos lacking Tcf7l2. These axonal defects may result from dysregulation of Nrp2 guidance receptor. Strikingly, loss of Tcf7l2 caused a post-mitotic identity switch between thalamic and habenular neurons. Despite normal acquisition of progenitor identity in prosomere 2, Tcf7l2-deficient thalamic neurons adopted a molecular profile of a neighboring forebrain derivative, the habenula. Conversely, habenular neurons failed to maintain their normal post-mitotic neuronal identity and acquired a subset of thalamic neuronal features in the absence of Tcf7l2. Our findings suggest a unique role for Tcf7l2 in generating distinct neuronal phenotypes from homogeneous progenitor population, and provide a better understanding of the mechanism underlying neuronal specification, differentiation, and connectivity of the developing caudal forebrain.

28220878|t|Homozygous carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-allele show altered postprandial response in triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.
28220878|a|The TCF7L2 rs7903146 T-allele shows the strongest association with type 2 diabetes (T2D) among common gene variants. The aim of this study was to assess circulating levels of metabolites following a meal test in individuals carrying the high risk rs790346 TT genotype (cases) and low-risk CC genotype (controls). Sixty-two men were recruited based on TCF7L2 genotype, 31 were TT carriers and 31 were age- and BMI-matched CC carriers. All participants consumed a test meal after 12   hours of fasting. Metabolites were measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Metabolomic profiling of TCF7L2 carriers were performed for 141 lipid estimates. TT carriers had lower fasting levels of L-VLDL-L (total lipids in large very low density lipoproteins, p   =   0.045), L-VLDL-CE (cholesterol esters in large VLDL, p   =   0.03), and L-VLDL-C (total cholesterol in large VLDL, p   =   0.045) compared to CC carriers. Additionally, TT carriers had lower postprandial levels of total triglycerides (TG) (q   =   0.03), VLDL-TG (q   =   0.05, including medium, small and extra small, q   =   0.048, q   =   0.0009, q   =   0.04, respectively), HDL-TG (triglycerides in high density lipoproteins q   =   0.037) and S-HDL-TG (q   =   0.00003). In conclusion, TT carriers show altered postprandial triglyceride response, mainly influencing VLDL and HDL subclasses suggesting a genotype-mediated effect on hepatic lipid regulation.

28253288|t|A novel TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes SNP identified from fine mapping in African American women.
28253288|a|SNP rs7903146 in the Wnt pathway's TCF7L2 gene is the variant most significantly associated with type 2 diabetes to date, with associations observed across diverse populations. We sought to determine whether variants in other Wnt pathway genes are also associated with this disease. We evaluated 69 genes involved in the Wnt pathway, including TCF7L2, for associations with type 2 diabetes in 2632 African American cases and 2596 controls from the Black Women's Health Study. Tag SNPs for each gene region were genotyped on a custom Affymetrix Axiom Array, and imputation was performed to 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data. Gene-based analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) statistic. The PSMD2 gene was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes after correction for multiple testing (corrected p = 0.016), based on the nine most significant single variants in the +/- 20 kb region surrounding the gene, which includes nearby genes EIF4G1, ECE2, and EIF2B5. Association data on four of the nine variants were available from an independent sample of 8284 African American cases and 15,543 controls; associations were in the same direction, but weak and not statistically significant. TCF7L2 was the only other gene associated with type 2 diabetes at nominal p <0.01 in our data. One of the three variants in the best gene-based model for TCF7L2, rs114770437, was not correlated with the GWAS index SNP rs7903146 and may represent an independent association signal seen only in African ancestry populations.

28254843|t|Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic/Latino Individuals: Results From the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).
28254843|a|Few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been conducted in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos of diverse backgrounds who are disproportionately affected by diabetes. We conducted a GWAS in 2,499 T2D case subjects and 5,247 control subjects from six Hispanic/Latino background groups in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). Our GWAS identified two known loci (<i>TCF7L2</i> and <i>KCNQ1)</i> reaching genome-wide significance levels. Conditional analysis on known index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated an additional independent signal at <i>KCNQ1</i>, represented by an African ancestry-specific variant, rs1049549 (odds ratio 1.49 [95% CI 1.27-1.75]). This association was consistent across Hispanic/Latino background groups and replicated in the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes in African Americans (MEDIA) Consortium. Among 80 previously known index SNPs at T2D loci, 66 SNPs showed consistency with the reported direction of associations and 14 SNPs significantly generalized to the HCHS/SOL. A genetic risk score based on these 80 index SNPs was significantly associated with T2D (odds ratio 1.07 [1.06-1.09] per risk allele), with a stronger effect observed in nonobese than in obese individuals. Our study identified a novel independent signal suggesting an African ancestry-specific allele at <i>KCNQ1</i> for T2D. Associations between previously identified loci and T2D were generally shown in a large cohort of U.S. Hispanics/Latinos.

28263491|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms are strong predictorsof type 2 diabetes among nonobese diabetics in the Turkish population.
28263491|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is1397645907a multifactorial disease, determined by environmental and genetic factors. Currently, the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene shows the strongest association with T2D. In this study, we investigated whether TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms are associated with T2D in a Turkish population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSCP, we genotyped six intronic polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene, commonly associated with T2D, in 169 individuals with diabetes and 119 healthy controls. RESULTS: We found that rs7903146 C  >  T substitution in intron 3 (OR: 1.9, P = 0.005) and rs12255372 G  >  T substitution in intron 4 (OR: 2.1, P = 0.002) were significantly associated with T2D while other SNPs were not associated (P > 0.05). We determined no association between TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, or HOMA-IR levels (P > 0.05), except for rs7903146 C  >  T substitution, which was significantly associated with the fasting glucose level (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that, in the Turkish population, the T allele of the rs7903146 (C  >  T) and rs12255372 (G  >  T) polymorphisms in the TCF7L2 gene is an independent risk factor for the development of T2D.

28277135|t|TCF7L2, CAPN10 polymorphisms are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risks: a meta-analysis.
28277135|a|Several polymorphisms have been identified in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), and calpain-10 (CAPN10) genes. Controversial conclusions for the genetic relationship between these polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risks were obtained. Our study aims at assessing whether these polymorphisms are associated with GDM susceptibility via a meta-analysis. A total of 19 eligible case-control articles were obtained after databases searching. A significantly increased GDM risk was observed for TCF7L2 rs7903146 (all OR   >   1, p   <   0.01), but not rs12255372. In addition, significant difference was observed in case/control comparison for 112/112 (GG/2R2R/TT) haplotype combination frequency of CAPN10 SNP-43/19/63 (OR   =   3.32, p   =   0.043). In summary, TCF7L2 rs7903146 and 112/112 haplotype of CAPN10 might be associated with GDM risks.

28283684|t|Pharmacogenetics in type 2 diabetes: precision medicine or discovery tool?
28283684|a|In recent years, technological and analytical advances have led to an explosion in the discovery of genetic loci associated with type 2 diabetes. However, their ability to improve prediction of disease outcomes beyond standard clinical risk factors has been limited. On the other hand, genetic effects on drug response may be stronger than those commonly seen for disease incidence. Pharmacogenetic findings may aid in identifying new drug targets, elucidate pathophysiology, unravel disease heterogeneity, help prioritise specific genes in regions of genetic association, and contribute to personalised or precision treatment. In diabetes, precedent for the successful application of pharmacogenetic concepts exists in its monogenic subtypes, such as MODY or neonatal diabetes. Whether similar insights will emerge for the much more common entity of type 2 diabetes remains to be seen. As genetic approaches advance, the progressive deployment of candidate gene, large-scale genotyping and genome-wide association studies has begun to produce suggestive results that may transform clinical practice. However, many barriers to the translation of diabetes pharmacogenetic discoveries to the clinic still remain. This perspective offers a contemporary overview of the field with a focus on sulfonylureas and metformin, identifies the major uses of pharmacogenetics, and highlights potential limitations and future directions.

28299838|t|Pilot cohort study on the potential role of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on ischemic heart disease among non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients.
28299838|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 rs7903146 C>T polymorphism is associated with diabetes in the general population but its independent impact on cardiovascular disease is debated. On this basis, we investigated its association with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in a single-center cohort of non-diabetic kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). METHODS: Patients with pretransplant diabetes were excluded and patients who developed post-transplant diabetes were censored at time of diagnosis. RESULTS: rs7903146 C>T polymorphism appeared to modulate the risk of MACE: 5-year prevalence was 0.8% in CC patients, 7.2% in CT patients and 9.7% in TT patients (P<.001). TCF7L2 rs7903146 was an independent predictor of MACE in a multivariate Cox regression model (for each T allele, HR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.62-5.52, P<.001), together with history of cardiac ischemic events (HR: 8.69, 95%CI: 3.57-21.16, P<.001), DGF (HR: 2.42, 95%CI: 0.98-5.95, P=.056) and HLA-mismatches (for each mismatch: HR: 1.55, 95%CI: 1.00-2.43, P=.053). Introduction of rs7903146 C>T polymorphism into a model based on these clinical variables significantly increased predictive power for MACE (P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele may be strongly and independently associated with MACE in non-diabetic KTRs. These findings suggest the possibility of employing this SNP to more accurately stratify cardiological risk in KTRs.

28323952|t|Randomized Controlled Trial of a MUFA or Fiber-Rich Diet on Hepatic Fat in Prediabetes.
28323952|a|Context: Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes worldwide is attributed in part to an unhealthy diet. Objective: To evaluate whether 12 weeks of high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) or fiber-rich weight-maintenance diet lowers hepatic fat and improves glucose tolerance in people with prediabetes. Design: Subjects underwent a [6, 6-2H2]-labeled 75-g oral glucose tolerance test to estimate hepatic insulin sensitivity and liver fat fraction (LFF) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after intervention. Setting: Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Trials Unit. Participants: 43 subjects with prediabetes. Intervention: Subjects were randomized into three isocaloric weight-maintaining diets containing MUFA (olive oil), extra fiber, and standard US food (control-habitual diet). Outcome Measures: LFF, glucose tolerance, and indices of insulin action and secretion. Results: Body weight was maintained constant in all groups during the intervention. Glucose and hormonal concentrations were similar in all groups before, and unchanged after, 12 weeks of intervention. LFF was significantly lower after intervention in the MUFA group (P < 0.0003) but remained unchanged in the fiber (P = 0.25) and control groups (P = 0.45). After 12 weeks, LFF was significantly lower in the MUFA than in the control group (P = 0.01), but fiber and control groups did not differ (P = 0.41). Indices of insulin action and secretion were not significantly different between the MUFA and control groups after intervention (P >=  0.11), but within-group comparison showed higher hepatic (P = 0.01) and total insulin sensitivity (P < 0.04) with MUFA. Conclusions: Twelve weeks of a MUFA diet decreases hepatic fat and improves both hepatic and total insulin sensitivity.

28343277|t|Pancreatic alpha cell-selective deletion of Tcf7l2 impairs glucagon secretion and counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycaemia in mice.
28343277|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a high mobility group (HMG) box-containing transcription factor and downstream effector of the Wnt signalling pathway. SNPs in the TCF7L2 gene have previously been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in genome-wide association studies. In animal studies, loss of Tcf7l2 function is associated with defective islet beta cell function and survival. Here, we explore the role of TCF7L2 in the control of the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia by generating mice with selective deletion of the Tcf7l2 gene in pancreatic alpha cells. METHODS: Alpha cell-selective deletion of Tcf7l2 was achieved by crossing mice with floxed Tcf7l2 alleles to mice bearing a Cre recombinase transgene driven by the preproglucagon promoter (PPGCre), resulting in Tcf7l2AKO mice. Glucose homeostasis and hormone secretion in vivo and in vitro, and islet cell mass were measured using standard techniques. RESULTS: While glucose tolerance was unaffected in Tcf7l2AKO mice, glucose infusion rates were increased (AUC for glucose during the first 60  min period of hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp test was increased by 1.98      0.26-fold [p  <  0.05; n  =  6] in Tcf7l2AKO mice vs wild-type mice) and glucagon secretion tended to be lower (plasma glucagon: 0.40      0.03-fold vs wild-type littermate controls [p  <  0.01; n  =  6]). Tcf7l2AKO mice displayed reduced fasted plasma glucose concentration. Glucagon release at low glucose was impaired in islets isolated from Tcf7l2AKO mice (0.37      0.02-fold vs islets from wild-type littermate control mice [p  <  0.01; n  =  6). Alpha cell mass was also reduced (72.3      20.3% [p  <  0.05; n  =  7) in Tcf7l2AKO mice compared with wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present findings demonstrate an alpha cell-autonomous role for Tcf7l2 in the control of pancreatic glucagon secretion and the maintenance of alpha cell mass and function.

28352326|t|Genetic variants in KCNJ11, TCF7L2 and HNF4A are associated with type 2 diabetes, BMI and dyslipidemia in families of Northeastern Mexico: A pilot study.
28352326|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate whether genetic markers considered risk factors for metabolic syndromes, including dyslipidemia, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), can be applied to a Northeastern Mexican population. A total of 37 families were analyzed for 63 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the age, body mass index (BMI), glucose tolerance values and blood lipid levels, including those of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very LDL (VLDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were evaluated. Three genetic markers previously associated with metabolic syndromes were identified in the sample population, including KCNJ11, TCF7L2 and HNF4A. The KCNJ11 SNP rs5210 was associated with T2DM, the TCF7L2 SNP rs11196175 was associated with BMI and cholesterol and LDL levels, the TCF7L2 SNP rs12255372 was associated with BMI and HDL, VLDL and triglyceride levels, and the HNF4A SNP rs1885088 was associated with LDL levels (P<0.05).

28362475|t|The genetic basis of obesity complications.
28362475|a|Intensive research is currently being performed into the genetic background of excess body mass compli- cations such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, especially atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Chronic inflammation is an important process in the pathogenesis of obesity, wherein there is an aberrant ex- pression of genes encoding adipokines. Visceral tissue is characterized by a higher expression and secretion of interleukin-8, interleukin-1   and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the subcutaneous tissue secretion of leptin prevails. An important complication of obesity is obstructive sleep apnea, often observed in Prader- Willi syndrome. The genetic background of sleep apnea may be a polymorphism of the SREBF1 gene. The consequence of excess body mass is metabolic syndrome, which may be related to the occurrence of the rs926198 variant of gene encoding caveolin-1. The genes of transcription factor TCF7L2 and PPAR-y2 take part in the pathogenesis of diabetes development. It has been demonstrated that oncogenes FOS, FOSB, and JUN may be co-responsible not only for obesity but also for osteoporosis and colorectal cancer. It has been shown that weight loss causes a modification in the expression of about 100 genes involvedt in the production of substances such as cytokines and other responsible for chronic inflammation in obesity. In future studies on the complications of obesity, such scientific disciplines as proteomics, peptidomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics should be used. The aim of this study is to present the current state of knowledge about the genetic basis of obesity complications.

28430825|t|Discovery and fine-mapping of adiposity loci using high density imputation of genome-wide association studies in individuals of African ancestry: African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium.
28430825|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >300 loci associated with measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), but few have been identified through screening of the African ancestry genomes. We performed large scale meta-analyses and replications in up to 52,895 individuals for BMI and up to 23,095 individuals for WHRadjBMI from the African Ancestry Anthropometry Genetics Consortium (AAAGC) using 1000 Genomes phase 1 imputed GWAS to improve coverage of both common and low frequency variants in the low linkage disequilibrium African ancestry genomes. In the sex-combined analyses, we identified one novel locus (TCF7L2/HABP2) for WHRadjBMI and eight previously established loci at P < 5*10-8: seven for BMI, and one for WHRadjBMI in African ancestry individuals. An additional novel locus (SPRYD7/DLEU2) was identified for WHRadjBMI when combined with European GWAS. In the sex-stratified analyses, we identified three novel loci for BMI (INTS10/LPL and MLC1 in men, IRX4/IRX2 in women) and four for WHRadjBMI (SSX2IP, CASC8, PDE3B and ZDHHC1/HSD11B2 in women) in individuals of African ancestry or both African and European ancestry. For four of the novel variants, the minor allele frequency was low (<5%). In the trans-ethnic fine mapping of 47 BMI loci and 27 WHRadjBMI loci that were locus-wide significant (P < 0.05 adjusted for effective number of variants per locus) from the African ancestry sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses, 26 BMI loci and 17 WHRadjBMI loci contained <=  20 variants in the credible sets that jointly account for 99% posterior probability of driving the associations. The lead variants in 13 of these loci had a high probability of being causal. As compared to our previous HapMap imputed GWAS for BMI and WHRadjBMI including up to 71,412 and 27,350 African ancestry individuals, respectively, our results suggest that 1000 Genomes imputation showed modest improvement in identifying GWAS loci including low frequency variants. Trans-ethnic meta-analyses further improved fine mapping of putative causal variants in loci shared between the African and European ancestry populations.

28438156|t|Relative contribution of type 1 and type 2 diabetes loci to the genetic etiology of adult-onset, non-insulin-requiring autoimmune diabetes.
28438156|a|BACKGROUND: In adulthood, autoimmune diabetes can present as non-insulin-requiring diabetes, termed as 'latent autoimmune diabetes in adults' (LADA). In this study, we investigated established type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic loci in a large cohort of LADA cases to assess where LADA is situated relative to these two well-characterized, classic forms of diabetes. METHODS: We tested the association of T1D and T2D GWAS-implicated loci in 978 LADA cases and 1057 non-diabetic controls of European ancestry using a linear mixed model. We then compared the associations of T1D and T2D loci between LADA and T1D and T2D cases, respectively. We quantified the difference in genetic risk between each given disease at each locus, and also calculated genetic risk scores to quantify how genetic liability to T1D and T2D distinguished LADA cases from controls. RESULTS: Overall, our results showed that LADA is genetically more similar to T1D, with the exception of an association at the T2D HNF1A locus. Several T1D loci were associated with LADA, including the major histocompatibility complex region, as well as at PTPN22, SH2B3, and INS. Contrary to previous studies, the key T2D risk allele at TCF7L2 (rs7903146-T) had a significantly lower frequency in LADA cases, suggesting that this locus does not play a role in LADA etiology. When constrained on antibody status, the similarity between LADA and T1D became more apparent; however, the HNF1A and TCF7L2 observations persisted. CONCLUSION: LADA is genetically closer to T1D than T2D, although the genetic load of T1D risk alleles is less than childhood-onset T1D, particularly at the major histocompatibility complex region, potentially accounting for the later disease onset. Our results show that the genetic spectrum of T1D extends into adult-onset diabetes, where it can clinically masquerade as T2D. Furthermore, T2D genetic risk plays a small role in LADA, with a degree of evidence for the HNF1A locus, highlighting the potential for genetic risk scores to contribute towards defining diabetes subtypes.

28465699|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphism and context-specific risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
28465699|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) is an element of the Wnt signaling pathway. There is lack of evidence if TCF7L2 has a functional role in lipid metabolism and regulation of the components constitutes the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). The aims of this study were to evaluate whether the risk allele of TCF7L2 gene polymorphism is associated with dyslipidemia and MetSyn. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MetSyn subjects were participated only based on the National Cholesterol Education Program - Third Adult Treatment Panel criteria. In this case-control study, the DNA from MetSyn patients without (n = 90) and with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 94) were genotyped. RESULTS: The results show that the genotype-phenotype for CC, CT/TT of TCF7L2 gene polymorphism correlated with body mass index and waist circumference in MetSyn and MetSyn + T2D subjects (r = -0.949 and r = -0.963, respectively). The subjects that only possess MetSyn but are not diabetics show the 2 h postprandial glucose and fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those subjects have both abnormality. The level of triglyceride in CT/TT carriers in MetSyn was higher than CC carriers (P = 0.025). A comparison with the controls subjects, the frequencies of the T allele in the groups of MetSyn (46.66%) and MetSyn + T2D (47.34%) show significantly different (P < 0.05). The odds ratios for T allele in (MetSyn)/(normal), (MetSyn + T2D)/(normal), and in (MetSyn + T2D)/(MetSyn) were 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-9.67, P = 0.0093), 3.76 (95% CI, 1.40-10.07, P = 0.0068), and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.55- 2.11, P = 0.834), respectively. CONCLUSION: The results revealed the important insights essential for the role of TCF7L2 that the T allele of TCF7L2 plays a significant role in the susceptibility to dyslipidemia, MetSyn, and T2D.

28482944|t|Increased birth weight is associated with altered gene expression in neonatal foreskin.
28482944|a|Elevated birth weight is linked to glucose intolerance and obesity health-related complications later in life. No studies have examined if infant birth weight is associated with gene expression markers of obesity and inflammation in a tissue that comes directly from the infant following birth. We evaluated the association between birth weight and gene expression on fetal programming of obesity. Foreskin samples were collected following circumcision, and gene expression analyzed comparing the 15% greatest birth weight infants (n=7) v. the remainder of the cohort (n=40). Multivariate linear regression models were fit to relate expression levels on differentially expressed genes to birth weight group with adjustment for variables selected from a list of maternal and infant characteristics. Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), leptin receptor (LEPR), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) were significantly upregulated and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and thioredoxin (TXN) downregulated in the larger birth weight neonates v. CONTROLS: Multivariate modeling revealed that the estimated adjusted birth weight group difference exceeded one standard deviation of the expression level for eight of the 10 genes. Between 25 and 50% of variation in expression level was explained by multivariate modeling for eight of the 10 genes. Gene expression related to glycemic control, appetite/energy balance, obesity and inflammation were altered in tissue from babies with elevated birth weight, and these genes may provide important information regarding fetal programming in macrosomic babies.

28490609|t|A Genome-Wide Association Study of IVGTT-Based Measures of First-Phase Insulin Secretion Refines the Underlying Physiology of Type 2 Diabetes Variants.
28490609|a|Understanding the physiological mechanisms by which common variants predispose to type 2 diabetes requires large studies with detailed measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity. Here we performed the largest genome-wide association study of first-phase insulin secretion, as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes from 10 studies. We aimed to refine the mechanisms of 178 known associations between common variants and glycemic traits and identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of first-phase insulin secretion at P < 0.05 and provided new evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion, intrinsic to the islet cells, is a key mechanism underlying the associations at the HNF1A, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, VPS13C/C2CD4A, FAF1, PTPRD, AP3S2, KCNK16, MAEA, LPP, WFS1, and TMPRSS6 loci. The fasting glucose-raising allele near PDX1, a known key insulin transcription factor, was strongly associated with lower first-phase insulin secretion but has no evidence for an effect on type 2 diabetes risk. The diabetes risk allele at TCF7L2 was associated with a stronger effect on peak insulin response than on C-peptide-based insulin secretion rate, suggesting a possible additional role in hepatic insulin clearance or insulin processing. In summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which common genetic variation influences type 2 diabetes risk and glycemic traits.

28587604|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic with considerable health and economic consequences. Sulfonylureas are widely used drugs for the treatment of patients with T2D. KCNJ11 and ABCC8 encode the Kir6.2 (pore-forming subunit) and SUR1 (regulatory subunit that binds to sulfonylurea) of pancreatic b cell KATP channel respectively with a critical role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. TCF7L2 encodes a transcription factor expressed in pancreatic b cells that regulates insulin production and processing. Because mutations of these genes could affect insulin secretion stimulated by sulfonylureas, the aim of this study is to assess associations between molecular variants of KCNJ11, ABCC8 and TCF7L2 genes and response to sulfonylurea treatment and to predict their potential functional effects. METHODS: Based on a comprehensive literature search, we found 13 pharmacogenetic studies showing that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in KCNJ11: rs5219 (E23K), ABCC8: rs757110 (A1369S), rs1799854 (intron 15, exon 16 -3C/T), rs1799859 (R1273R), and TCF7L2: rs7903146 (intron 4) were significantly associated with responses to sulfonylureas. For in silico bioinformatics analysis, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PANTHER, MutPred, and SNPs3D were applied for functional predictions of 36 coding (KCNJ11: 10, ABCC8: 24, and TCF7L2: 2; all are missense), and HaploReg v4.1, RegulomeDB, and Ensembl's VEP were used to predict functions of 7 non-coding (KCNJ11: 1, ABCC8: 1, and TCF7L2: 5) SNPs, respectively. RESULTS: Based on various in silico tools, 8 KCNJ11 missense SNPs, 23 ABCC8 missense SNPs, and 2 TCF7L2 missense SNPs could affect protein functions. Of them, previous studies showed that mutant alleles of 4 KCNJ11 missense SNPs and 5 ABCC8 missense SNPs can be successfully rescued by sulfonylurea treatments. Further, 3 TCF7L2 non-coding SNPs (rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372), can change motif(s) based on HaploReg v4.1 and are predicted as risk factors by Ensembl's VEP. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that a personalized medicine approach by tailoring sulfonylurea therapy of T2D patients according to their genotypes of KCNJ11, ABCC8, and TCF7L2 could attain an optimal treatment efficacy.

28592605|t|Interaction between genes and macronutrient intake on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes: systematic review and findings from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-InterAct.
28592605|a|<b>Background:</b> Gene-diet interactions have been reported to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, to our knowledge, few examples have been consistently replicated to date.<b>Objective:</b> We aimed to identify existing evidence for gene-macronutrient interactions and T2D and to examine the reported interactions in a large-scale study.<b>Design:</b> We systematically reviewed studies reporting gene-macronutrient interactions and T2D. We searched the MEDLINE, Human Genome Epidemiology Network, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform electronic databases to identify studies published up to October 2015. Eligibility criteria included assessment of macronutrient quantity (e.g., total carbohydrate) or indicators of quality (e.g., dietary fiber) by use of self-report or objective biomarkers of intake. Interactions identified in the review were subsequently examined in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer)-InterAct case-cohort study (<i>n</i> = 21,148, with 9403 T2D cases; 8 European countries). Prentice-weighted Cox regression was used to estimate country-specific HRs, 95% CIs, and <i>P</i>-interaction values, which were then pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. A primary model was fitted by using the same covariates as reported in the published studies, and a second model adjusted for additional covariates and estimated the effects of isocaloric macronutrient substitution.<b>Results:</b> Thirteen observational studies met the eligibility criteria (<i>n</i> < 1700 cases). Eight unique interactions were reported to be significant between macronutrients [carbohydrate, fat, saturated fat, dietary fiber, and glycemic load derived from self-report of dietary intake and circulating n-3 (  -3) polyunsaturated fatty acids] and genetic variants in or near transcription factor 7-like 2 (<i>TCF7L2</i>), gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (<i>GIPR</i>), caveolin 2 (<i>CAV2</i>), and peptidase D (<i>PEPD</i>) (<i>P</i>-interaction < 0.05). We found no evidence of interaction when we tried to replicate previously reported interactions. In addition, no interactions were detected in models with additional covariates.<b>Conclusions:</b> Eight gene-macronutrient interactions were identified for the risk of T2D from the literature. These interactions were not replicated in the EPIC-InterAct study, which mirrored the analyses undertaken in the original reports. Our findings highlight the importance of independent replication of reported interactions.

28595632|t|A comparison of gene expression profiles in patients with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and their coexisting conditions.
28595632|a|BACKGROUND: To support a hypothesis that there is an intrinsic interplay between coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we used RNA-seq to identify unique gene expression signatures of CAD, T2D, and coexisting conditions. METHODS: After transcriptome sequencing, differential expression analysis was performed between each disordered state and normal control group. By comparing gene expression profiles of CAD, T2D, and coexisting conditions, common and specific patterns of each disordered state were displayed. To verify the specific gene expression patterns of CAD or T2D, the gene expression data of GSE23561 was extracted. RESULTS: A strong overlap of 191 genes across CAD, T2D and coexisting conditions, were mainly involved in a viral infectious cycle, anti-apoptosis, endocrine pancreas development, innate immune response, and blood coagulation. In T2D-specific PPI networks involving 64 genes, TCF7L2 (Degree   =   169) was identified as a key gene in T2D development, while in CAD-specific PPI networks involving 64 genes, HIF1A (Degree   =   124), SMAD1 (Degree   =   112) and SKIL (Degree   =   94) were identified as key genes in the CAD development. Interestingly, with the provided expression data from GSE23561, the three genes were all up-regulated in CAD, and SMAD1 and SKIL were specifically differentially expressed in CAD, while HIF1A was differentially expressed in both CAD and T2D, but with opposite trends. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some evidences in transcript level to uncover the association of T2D, CAD and coexisting conditions, and may provide novel drug targets and biomarkers for these diseases.

28607931|t|Genetic Epidemiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Mexican Mestizos.
28607931|a|There are currently about 415 million people with diabetes worldwide, a figure likely to increase to 642 million by 2040. In 2015, Mexico was the second Latin American country and sixth in the world in prevalence of this disorder with nearly 11.5 million of patients. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the main kind of diabetes and its etiology is complex with environmental and genetic factors involved. Indeed, polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with this disease worldwide. To estimate the genetic epidemiology of T2D in Mexican mestizos a systematic bibliographic search of published articles through PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was conducted. Just case-control studies of candidate genes about T2D in Mexican mestizo inhabitants were included. Nineteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were found. In total, 68 polymorphisms of 41 genes were assessed; 26 of them were associated with T2D risk, which were located in ABCA1, ADRB3, CAPN10, CDC123/CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CRP, ELMO1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, IRS1, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, LTA, NXPH1, SIRT1, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and TNF-a genes. Overall, 21 of the 41 analyzed genes were associated with T2D in Mexican mestizos. Such a genetic heterogeneity compares with findings in other ethnic groups.

29174029|t|Interrelationship of the rs7903146 TCF7L2 gene variant with measures of glucose metabolism and adiposity: The NEO study.
29174029|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We investigated the interrelationship of rs7903146-T in TCF7L2 with measures of glucose metabolism and measures of adiposity. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 5744 middle-aged participants (mean (standard deviation [SD]) age is 55.9 (6.0) years) from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) Study. Associations between rs7903146-T and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) were assessed with logistic regression. Additive (per-allele) associations with measures of glucose metabolism (e.g., fasting insulin) and adiposity (e.g., body mass index [BMI]) were examined with multivariable linear regression. In the total study population, rs7903146-T was associated with a higher risk of T2D (additive odds ratio: 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.17; 1.72), and specifically with T2D treated with insulin analogs (2.31 [1.19; 4.46]). After exclusion of participants treated with glucose-lowering medication, rs7903146-T was associated with lower mean insulin concentration (additive mean difference: -0.07 SD [-0.14; 0.00]), but not with higher mean glucose concentration (0.03 SD [-0.01; 0.07]). Furthermore, rs7903146-T was associated with, among other measures of adiposity, a lower mean BMI (-0.04 SD [-0.09; -0.00]), and a lower mean total body fat (-0.04 SD [-0.08; -0.00]). The association between rs7903146-T and T2D increased after adjustment for BMI (odds ratio: 1.51 [1.24; 1.86]); the association between rs7903146-T and fasting insulin diminished after adjustment (-0.05 SD [-0.11; 0.02]). CONCLUSION: rs7903146-T is associated with a decreased insulin concentration and increased risk of T2D with opposing effects of adjustment for adiposity.

29182660|t|Interaction between TCF7L2 polymorphism and dietary fat intake on high density lipoprotein cholesterol.
29182660|a|Recent evidence suggests that lifestyle factors influence the association between the Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants and cardio-metabolic traits in several populations; however, the available research is limited among the Asian Indian population. Hence, the present study examined whether the association between the MC4R single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs17782313) and two SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene (rs12255372 and rs7903146) and cardio-metabolic traits is modified by dietary factors and physical activity. This cross sectional study included a random sample of normal glucose tolerant (NGT) (n = 821) and participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 861) recruited from the urban part of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES). A validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment and self-reported physical activity measures were collected. The threshold for significance was set at P = 0.00023 based on Bonferroni correction for multiple testing [(0.05/210 (3 SNPs x 14 outcomes x 5 lifestyle factors)]. After Bonferroni correction, there was a significant interaction between the TCF7L2 rs12255372 SNP and fat intake (g/day) (Pinteraction = 0.0001) on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), where the 'T' allele carriers in the lowest tertile of total fat intake had higher HDL-C (P = 0.008) and those in the highest tertile (P = 0.017) had lower HDL-C compared to the GG homozygotes. In a secondary analysis of SNPs with the subtypes of fat, there was also a significant interaction between the SNP rs12255372 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, g/day) (Pinteraction<0.0001) on HDL-C, where the minor allele carriers had higher HDL-C in the lowest PUFA tertile (P = 0.024) and those in the highest PUFA tertile had lower HDL-C (P = 0.028) than GG homozygotes. In addition, a significant interaction was also seen between TCF7L2 SNP rs12255372 and fibre intake (g/day) on HDL-C (Pinteraction<0.0001). None of the other interactions between the SNPs and lifestyle factors were statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. Our findings indicate that the association between TCF7L2 SNP rs12255372 and HDL-C may be modified by dietary fat intake in this Asian Indian population.

29220676|t|Penetrance of Polygenic Obesity Susceptibility Loci across the Body Mass Index Distribution.
29220676|a|A growing number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity, but whether the effects of these obesity-susceptibility loci are uniform across the BMI distribution remains unclear. We studied the effects of 37 BMI-associated SNPs in 75,230 adults of European ancestry across BMI percentiles by using conditional quantile regression (CQR) and meta-regression (MR) models. The effects of nine SNPs (24%)-rs1421085 (FTO; p = 8.69  * 10<sup>-15</sup>), rs6235 (PCSK1; p  =  7.11  * 10<sup>-6</sup>), rs7903146 (TCF7L2; p = 9.60  * 10<sup>-6</sup>), rs11873305 (MC4R; p = 5.08  * 10<sup>-5</sup>), rs12617233 (FANCL; p = 5.30  * 10<sup>-5</sup>), rs11672660 (GIPR; p = 1.64  * 10<sup>-4</sup>), rs997295 (MAP2K5; p = 3.25  * 10<sup>-4</sup>), rs6499653 (FTO; p = 6.23  * 10<sup>-4</sup>), and rs3824755 (NT5C2; p = 7.90  * 10<sup>-4</sup>)-increased significantly across the sample BMI distribution. We showed that such increases stemmed from unadjusted gene interactions that enhanced the effects of SNPs in persons with a high BMI. When 125 height-associated SNPs were analyzed for comparison, only one (<1%), rs6219 (IGF1, p = 1.80  * 10<sup>-4</sup>), showed effects that varied significantly across height percentiles. Cumulative gene scores of these SNPs (GS-BMI and GS-height) showed that only GS-BMI had effects that increased significantly across the sample distribution (BMI: p = 7.03  * 10<sup>-37</sup>; height: p = 0.499). Overall, these findings underscore the importance of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in shaping the genetic architecture of BMI and advance a method for detecting such interactions by using only the sample outcome distribution.

29246974|t|Pancreatic Pericytes Support b-Cell Function in a Tcf7l2-Dependent Manner.
29246974|a|Polymorphism in TCF7L2, a component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, has a strong association with b-cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes through a mechanism that has yet to be defined. b-Cells rely on cells in their microenvironment, including pericytes, for their proper function. Here, we show that Tcf7l2 activity in pancreatic pericytes is required for b-cell function. Transgenic mice in which Tcf7l2 was selectively inactivated in their pancreatic pericytes exhibited impaired glucose tolerance due to compromised b-cell function and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Inactivation of pericytic Tcf7l2 was associated with impaired expression of genes required for b-cell function and maturity in isolated islets. In addition, we identified Tcf7l2-dependent pericytic expression of secreted factors shown to promote b-cell function, including bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Finally, we show that exogenous BMP4 is sufficient to rescue the impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of transgenic mice, pointing to a potential mechanism through which pericytic Tcf7l2 activity affects b-cells. To conclude, we suggest that pancreatic pericytes produce secreted factors, including BMP4, in a Tcf7l2-dependent manner to support b-cell function. Our findings thus propose a potential cellular mechanism through which abnormal TCF7L2 activity predisposes individuals to diabetes and implicates abnormalities in the islet microenvironment in this disease.

29309628|t|Genome-wide association study of offspring birth weight in 86   577 women identifies five novel loci and highlights maternal genetic effects that are independent of fetal genetics.
29309628|a|Genome-wide association studies of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics, whereas relatively little is known about the role of maternal genetic variation. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth. We meta-analysed data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86   577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects. Maternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9, CYP3A7) were associated with offspring birth weight at P   <   5   *   10-8. In SEM analyses, at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration. The identified associations indicate that genetic effects on maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potentially on maternal blood pressure and immune function, are relevant for fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations in mechanistic and causal analyses will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights.

29314572|t|Methylation of Tcf712 promoter by high-fat diet impairs b-cell function in mouse pancreatic islets.
29314572|a|BACKGROUND: The TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2) gene is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes risk. However, many people without the TCF7L2 at-risk allele develop T2D. The aim of this study was to investigate altered Tcf7l2 DNA methylation and gene expression caused by high-fat diets (HFDs). METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed either an HFD or normal diet for 8  weeks, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed. Pancreatic islets were sorted for bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction to determine DNA methylation status. We cloned the Tcf7l2 promoter, methylated it with methyltransferase, and transfected this construct into MIN-6 cells to confirm the effects of promoter methylation on Tcf7l2 expression. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation at position -165  bp relative to the transcriptional start site of Tcf7l2 was present in mice fed an HFD. Accordingly, expression of Tcf7l2 mRNA and its corresponding protein was lower in the HFD group (P  <  .05). Methylation of the Tcf7l2 promoter suppressed gene expression in MIN-6 cells. CONCLUSION: An HFD was shown to induce aberrant methylation of the Tcf7l2 promoter in mouse islets, which resulted in diminished gene expression. This study provides an evidence of the association between nutrient consumption and gene expression.

29317436|t|The Diabetes Gene and Wnt Pathway Effector TCF7L2 Regulates Adipocyte Development and Function.
29317436|a|The gene encoding for transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) candidate gene discovered to date. The TCF7L2 protein is a key transcriptional effector of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, which is an important developmental pathway that negatively regulates adipogenesis. However, the precise role that TCF7L2 plays in the development and function of adipocytes remains largely unknown. Using a combination of in vitro approaches, we first show that TCF7L2 protein is increased during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and primary adipocyte stem cells and that TCF7L2 expression is required for the regulation of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. Inactivation of TCF7L2 protein by removing the high-mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain in mature adipocytes in vivo leads to whole-body glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. This phenotype is associated with increased subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, adipocyte hypertrophy, and inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that TCF7L2 mRNA expression is downregulated in humans with impaired glucose tolerance and adipocyte insulin resistance, highlighting the translational potential of these findings. In summary, our data indicate that TCF7L2 has key roles in adipose tissue development and function that may reveal, at least in part, how TCF7L2 contributes to the pathophysiology of T2DM.

29325775|t|Nutrigenetic variants and cardio-metabolic risk in women with or without gestational diabetes.
29325775|a|AIM: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent metabolic disorder in pregnancy and it can be considered a silent risk associated to T2DM and CVD later in life. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of clinical parameters with nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved with nutrients and metabolism in women with or without GDM in order to identify potential routine clinical markers for early prevention. METHODS: Nine gene variants associated with nutrients and metabolism, namely PPARG2 rs1801282 (C   >   G); PPARGC1A rs8192678 (C   >   T); TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C   >   T); LDLR rs2228671 (C   >   T); MTHFR rs1801133 (C   >   T); APOA5 rs662799 (T   >   C); GCKR rs1260326 (C   >   T); FTO rs9939609 (T   >   A); MC4R rs17782313 (T   >   C) were genotyped in 104 GDM cases and 124 controls using High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. RESULTS: The genetic variant rs7903146 (C   >   T) in TCF7L2 gene showed a strong association with GDM risk (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: [1.24-5.29]). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and polymorphisms in other genes, namely PPARG2 [p   =   0,03], APOA5 [p   =   0,02], MC4R [p   =   0,03], LDLR [p   =   0,04] and FTO [p   =   0,03]. In addition, rs17782313 variant, mapped close to MC4R gene, was associated to BMI in pre-pregnancy [p   =   0,02] and at the end of pregnancy [p   =   0,03] in GDM group. CONCLUSION: In our study, we found significant associations between routine clinical parameters and some gene variants connected with nutrients and metabolism in women with GDM. These results can provide useful information to develop effective tools and possible personalized intervention strategies in a timely manner.

29326107|t|TCF7L2 Genetic Variation Augments Incretin Resistance and Influences Response to a Sulfonylurea and Metformin: The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH).
29326107|a|OBJECTIVE: The rs7903146 T allele in transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the mechanisms for increased risk remain unclear. We evaluated the physiologic and hormonal effects of TCF7L2 genotype before and after interventions that influence glucose physiology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped rs7903146 in 608 individuals without diabetes and recorded biochemical data before and after 1) one dose of glipizide (5 mg) on visit 1 and 2) a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed after administration of metformin 500 mg twice daily over 2 days. Incretin levels were measured in 150 of the 608 participants. RESULTS: TT risk-allele homozygotes had 1.6 mg/dL higher baseline fasting glucose levels and 2.5 pg/mL lower glucagon levels per T allele than carriers of other genotypes at baseline. In a subset of participants, the T allele was associated with higher basal glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels at visit 1 (b = 1.52, P = 0.02 and b = 0.96, P = 0.002 for total and active GLP-1, respectively), and across all points of the OGTT after metformin administration. Regarding drug response, the T allele was associated with a shorter time (b = -7.00, P = 0.03) and a steeper slope (b = 0.23, P = 0.04) to trough glucose levels after glipizide administration, and lower visit 2 fasting glucose level adjusted for visit 1 fasting glucose level (b = -1.02, P = 0.04) and a greater decline in glucose level between visits (b = -1.61, P = 0.047) after metformin administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that common variation at TCF7L2 influences acute responses to both glipizide and metformin in people without diabetes and highlight altered incretin signaling as a potential mechanism by which TCF7L2 variation increases T2D risk.

29331016|t|A candidate functional SNP rs7074440 in TCF7L2 alters gene expression through C-FOS in hepatocytes.
29331016|a|The SNP rs7903146 at the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) locus is established as the strongest known genetic marker for type 2 diabetes via genome-wide association studies. However, the functional SNPs regulating TCF7L2 expression remain unclear. Here, we show that the SNP rs7074440 is a candidate functional SNP highly linked with rs7903146. A reporter plasmid with rs7074440 normal allele sequence exhibited 15-fold higher luciferase activity compared with risk allele sequence in hepatocytes, demonstrating a strong enhancer activity at rs7074440. Additionally, we identified C-FOS as an activator binding to the rs7074440 enhancer using a TFEL genome-wide screen method. Consistently, knockdown of C-FOS significantly reduced TCF7L2 expression in hepatocytes. Collectively, a novel enhancer regulating TCF7L2 expression was revealed through searching for functional SNPs.

29340108|t|Effect of gene-lifestyle interaction on gestational diabetes risk.
29340108|a|We hypothesized that the association of certain lifestyle parameters with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk would depend on susceptibility loci. In total, 278 Russian women with GDM and 179 controls completed questionnaires about lifestyle habits (food consumption, physical activity and smoking). GDM was diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups. Maternal blood was sampled for genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MTNR1B (rs10830963 and rs1387153), GCK (rs1799884), KCNJ11 (rs5219), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), CDKAL1 (rs7754840), IRS1 (rs1801278) and FTO (rs9939609). Binary logistic regression revealed an interaction effect of sausage intake and the number of risk alleles of two SNPs (rs10830963 in MTNR1B and rs1799884 in GCK) on GDM risk (P < 0.001). Among women without risk alleles of these two SNPs, sausage consumption was positively associated with GDM risk (P trend = 0.045). This difference was not revealed in women carrying 1 or more risk alleles. The risk of GDM increased as the number of risk alles increased in participants with low and moderate sausage consumption (P trend <0.001 and 0.006, respectively), while the risk of GDM in women with high sausage consumption remained relatively high, independent of the number of risk alleles. These findings indicate that the association of sausage consumption with GDM risk can be determined based on the number of risk alleles of rs10830963 in MTNR1B and rs1799884 in GCK.

29392078|t|PARP-1 Inhibition Rescues Short Lifespan in Hyperglycemic C. Elegans And Improves GLP-1 Secretion in Human Cells.
29392078|a|TCF7L2 is located at one of the most strongly associated type 2 diabetes loci reported to date. We previously reported that the most abundant member of a specific protein complex to bind across the presumed causal variant at this locus, rs7903146, was poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase type 1 (PARP-1). We analyzed the impact of PARP-1 inhibition on C. elegans health in the setting of hyperglycemia and on glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in human intestinal cells. Given that high glucose concentrations progressively shorten the lifespan of C. elegans, in part by impacting key well-conserved insulin-modulated signaling pathways, we investigated the effect of PARP-1 inhibition with Olaparib on the lifespan of C. elegans nematodes under varying hyperglycemic conditions. Subsequently, we investigated whether Olaparib treatment had any effect on glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in the human NCI-H716 intestinal cell line, a model system for the investigation of enteroendocrine function. Treatment with 100uM Olaparib in nematodes exposed to high concentrations of glucose led to significant lifespan rescue. The beneficial lifespan effect of Olaparib appeared to require both PARP-1 and TCF7L2, since treatment had no effect in hyperglycemic conditions in knock-out worm strains for either of these homologs. Further investigation using the NCI-H716 cells revealed that Olaparib significantly enhanced secretion of the incretin, GLP-1, plus the gene expression of TCF7L2, GCG and PC1. These data from studies in both C. elegans and a human cell line suggest that PARP-1 inhibition offers a novel therapeutic avenue to treat type 2 diabetes.

29396371|t|Genome-wide analysis of PDX1 target genes in human pancreatic progenitors.
29396371|a|OBJECTIVE: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the homeobox transcription factor (TF) PDX1 leads to pancreatic agenesis, whereas heterozygous mutations can cause Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young 4 (MODY4). Although the function of Pdx1 is well studied in pre-clinical models during insulin-producing b-cell development and homeostasis, it remains elusive how this TF controls human pancreas development by regulating a downstream transcriptional program. Also, comparative studies of PDX1 binding patterns in pancreatic progenitors and adult b-cells have not been conducted so far. Furthermore, many studies reported the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and T2DM, and it has been shown that islet enhancers are enriched in T2DM-associated SNPs. Whether regions, harboring T2DM-associated SNPs are PDX1 bound and active at the pancreatic progenitor stage has not been reported so far. METHODS: In this study, we have generated a novel induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line that efficiently differentiates into human pancreatic progenitors (PPs). Furthermore, PDX1 and H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify PDX1 transcriptional targets and active enhancer and promoter regions. To address potential differences in the function of PDX1 during development and adulthood, we compared PDX1 binding profiles from PPs and adult islets. Moreover, combining ChIP-seq and GWAS meta-analysis data we identified T2DM-associated SNPs in PDX1 binding sites and active chromatin regions. RESULTS: ChIP-seq for PDX1 revealed a total of 8088 PDX1-bound regions that map to 5664 genes in iPSC-derived PPs. The PDX1 target regions include important pancreatic TFs, such as PDX1 itself, RFX6, HNF1B, and MEIS1, which were activated during the differentiation process as revealed by the active chromatin mark H3K27ac and mRNA expression profiling, suggesting that auto-regulatory feedback regulation maintains PDX1 expression and initiates a pancreatic TF program. Remarkably, we identified several PDX1 target genes that have not been reported in the literature in human so far, including RFX3, required for ciliogenesis and endocrine differentiation in mouse, and the ligand of the Notch receptor DLL1, which is important for endocrine induction and tip-trunk patterning. The comparison of PDX1 profiles from PPs and adult human islets identified sets of stage-specific target genes, associated with early pancreas development and adult b-cell function, respectively. Furthermore, we found an enrichment of T2DM-associated SNPs in active chromatin regions from iPSC-derived PPs. Two of these SNPs fall into PDX1 occupied sites that are located in the intronic regions of TCF7L2 and HNF1B. Both of these genes are key transcriptional regulators of endocrine induction and mutations in cis-regulatory regions predispose to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide stage-specific target genes of PDX1 during in  vitro differentiation of stem cells into pancreatic progenitors that could be useful to identify pathways and molecular targets that predispose for diabetes. In addition, we show that T2DM-associated SNPs are enriched in active chromatin regions at the pancreatic progenitor stage, suggesting that the susceptibility to T2DM might originate from imperfect execution of a b-cell developmental program.

29400991|t|Lifestyle genomics and the metabolic syndrome: A review of genetic variants that influence response to diet and exercise interventions.
29400991|a|Metabolic syndrome (MetS) comprises a cluster of risk factors that includes central obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose homeostasis and hypertension. Individuals with MetS have elevated risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease; thus placing significant burdens on social and healthcare systems. Lifestyle interventions (comprised of diet, exercise or a combination of both) are routinely recommended as the first line of treatment for MetS. Only a proportion of people respond, and it has been assumed that psychological and social aspects primarily account for these differences. However, the etiology of MetS is multifactorial and stems, in part, on a person's genetic make-up. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with the various components of MetS, and several of these SNPs have been shown to modify a person's response to lifestyle interventions. Consequently, genetic variants can influence the extent to which a person responds to changes in diet and/or exercise. The goal of this review is to highlight SNPs reported to influence the magnitude of change in body weight, dyslipidemia, glucose homeostasis and blood pressure during lifestyle interventions aimed at improving MetS components. Knowledge regarding these genetic variants and their ability to modulate a person's response will provide additional context for improving the effectiveness of personalized lifestyle interventions that aim to reduce the risks associated with MetS.

29444352|t|Predictive performance of a genetic risk score using 11 susceptibility alleles for the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in a general Japanese population: a nested case-control study.
29444352|a|AIMS: To assess the predictive ability of a genetic risk score for the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in a general Japanese population. METHODS: This prospective case-control study, nested within a Japan Public Health Centre-based prospective study, included 466 participants with incident Type 2 diabetes over a 5-year period (cases) and 1361 control participants, as well as 1463 participants with existing diabetes and 1463 control participants. Eleven susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms, identified through genome-wide association studies and replicated in Japanese populations, were analysed. RESULTS: Most single nucleotide polymorphism loci showed directionally consistent associations with diabetes. From the combined samples, one single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2206734 at CDKAL1) reached a genome-wide significance level (odds ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.40; P = 1.8 * 10-8 ). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2206734 in CDKAL1, rs2383208 in CDKN2A/B, and rs2237892 in KCNQ1) were nominally significantly associated with incident diabetes. Compared with the lowest quintile of the total number of risk alleles, the highest quintile had a higher odds of incident diabetes (odds ratio 2.34, 95% CI 1.59-3.46) after adjusting for conventional risk factors such as age, sex and BMI. The addition to the conventional risk factor-based model of a genetic risk score using the 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly improved predictive performance; the c-statistic increased by 0.021, net reclassification improved by 6.2%, and integrated discrimination improved by 0.003. CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective findings suggest that the addition of a genetic risk score may provide modest but significant incremental predictive performance beyond that of the conventional risk factor-based model without biochemical markers.

29458357|t|Genomic screening for monogenic forms of diabetes.
29458357|a|Adult-onset, or type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a complex genetic architecture, from hundreds of genes with low penetrance, common susceptibility variants (e.g., TCF7L2), to a set of more than ten genes that, when mutated, can cause a single-gene or Mendelian form of T2DM (e.g., GCK). It is a clinical challenge to identify patients with the uncommon (2-3%) form of T2DM, typically classified as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Bansal et al. (BMC Med 15:213, 2017) used a gene panel test approach to test patients with diabetes for single-gene causes of MODY. They found that nearly 2% of younger patients had pathogenic variants in one of seven genes. These data confirm prior studies showing that Mendelian or single-gene MODY can masquerade as garden variety T2DM. The implications of these results for wider general medicine and the future implementation of clinical genome sequencing are discussed.Please see related article: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0977-3.

29473503|t|Genetic Variants Identified from GWAS for Predisposition to Type 2 Diabetes Predict Sulfonylurea Drug Response.
29473503|a|BACKGROUND: Several SNPs were identified through GWAS for their association with type 2 diabetes which has implications to pancreatic b-cell physiology. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the role of risk alleles of TCF7L2, KCNJ11, CDKN2A, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8 and KCNQ1 along with pharmacokinetic variants in response to sulfonylureas. METHOD: We performed a prospective study on 209 newly diagnosed subjects; treatment naive T2D subjects were recruited. Individuals were started with glibenclamide monotherapy and followed-up for 12 weeks. Genotyping was done, using PCR-RFLP and TETRA-ARMS PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: In univariate regression analysis, KCNJ11 (rs5219) was only the predictor for glibenclamide treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The present data suggests a possible role of KCNJ11 gene in altered response to glibenclamide.

29514658|t|Meta-analysis of association between TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
29514658|a|BACKGROUND: Large scale association studies have found a significant association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism rs7903146. However, the quality of data varies greatly, as the studies report inconsistent results in different populations. Hence, we perform this meta-analysis to give a more convincing result. METHODS: The articles, published from January 1st, 2000 to April 1st, 2017, were identified by searching in PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 56628 participants (34232 cases and 22396 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 28 studies were divided into 4 subgroups: Caucasian (10 studies), East Asian (5 studies), South Asian (5 studies) and Others (8 studies). All the data analyses were analyzed by the R package meta. RESULTS: The significant association was observed by using the dominant model (OR   =   1.41, CI   =   1.36   -   1.47, p   <   0.0001), recessive model (OR   =   1.58, CI   =   1.48   -   1.69, p   <   0.0001), additive model(CT vs CC) (OR   =   1.34, CI   =   1.28-1.39, p   <   0.0001), additive model(TT vs CC) (OR   =   1.81, CI   =   1.69-1.94, p   <   0.0001)and allele model (OR   =   1.35, CI   =   1.31-1.39, p   <   0.0001). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggested that rs7903146 was significantly associated with T2DM in Caucasian, East Asian, South Asian and other ethnicities.

29590649|t|Circulating LncRNAs Analysis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Reveals Novel Genes Influencing Glucose Metabolism and Islet b-Cell Function.
29590649|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The islet is an important endocrine organ to secrete insulin to regulate the metabolism of glucose and maintain the stability of blood glucose. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a variety of biological functions and play key roles in many diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this study was to determine whether lncRNA-p3134 is associated with glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in pancreatic b cells. METHODS: LncRNA microarray technology was used to identify the differentially expressed circulating lncRNAs in T2D patients. RT-PCR analyses were performed to determine the expression of lncRNA-p3134 in 30 pairs of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The correlation of lncRNA-p3134 to clinical data from T2D patients was analyzed. LncRNA-p3134 was overexpressed in Min6 cells and db/db mice by adenovirus-mediated technology. CCK-8, TUNEL, Western blot, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), ELISAs and immunochemistry were performed to determine the effect of lncRNA-p3134 on proliferation, apoptosis and insulin secretion both in vitro and vivo. RESULTS: The circulating level of lncRNA-p3134 was higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic controls and was correlated with fasting blood glucose and HOMA-b levels. The lncRNA-p3134 had risen by 4 times in serum exosomes but nearly unchanged in exosome-free samples. The secretion of lncRNA-p3134 was dynamically modulated by glucose in both Min6 cells and isolated mouse islet cells. LncRNA-p3134 positively regulate GSIS through promoting of key regulators (Pdx-1, MafA, GLUT2 and Tcf7l2) in b cells. In addition, the overexpression of lncRNA-p3134 resulted in a decreased apoptosis ratio and partially reversed the glucotoxicity effects on GSIS function in Min6 cells. The restoration of insulin synthesis and secretion the increase of the insulin positive cells areas by upregulation of lncRNA-p3134 in db/db mice confirmed the compensatory role of lncRNA-p3134 to preserve b-cell function. Furthermore, a protective effect of lncRNA-p3134 on GSIS by positive modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was also confirmed. After blocking the PI3K/AKT signals with their specific inhibitor, the effect of overexpressed lncRNA-p3134 on insulin secretion was obviously attenuated. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results of this study provide new insights into lncRNA-p3134 regulation in pancreatic b cells and provide a better understanding of novel mechanism of glucose homeostasis.

29631902|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2 gene links increased in vivo insulin synthesis to type 2 diabetes.
29631902|a|Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the main susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes, primarily through impairing the insulin secretion by pancreatic b cells. However, the exact in vivo mechanisms remain poorly understood. We performed a family study and determined if the T risk allele of the rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene increases the risk of type 2 diabetes based on real-time stable isotope measurements of insulin synthesis during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. In addition, we performed oral minimal model (OMM) analyses to assess insulin sensitivity and b cell function indices. Compared to unaffected relatives, individuals with type 2 diabetes had lower OMM indices and a higher level of insulin synthesis. We found a T allele-dosage effect on insulin synthesis and on glucose tolerance status, therefore insulin synthesis was higher among T-allele carriers with type 2 diabetes than in wild-type individuals. These results suggest that hyperinsulinemia is not only an adaptation to insulin resistance, but also a direct cause of type 2 diabetes.

29675560|t|Patterns of differential gene expression in a cellular model of human islet development, and relationship to type 2 diabetes predisposition.
29675560|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Most type 2 diabetes-associated genetic variants identified via genome-wide association studies (GWASs) appear to act via the pancreatic islet. Observed defects in insulin secretion could result from an impact of these variants on islet development and/or the function of mature islets. Most functional studies have focused on the latter, given limitations regarding access to human fetal islet tissue. Capitalising upon advances in in vitro differentiation, we characterised the transcriptomes of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines differentiated along the pancreatic endocrine lineage, and explored the contribution of altered islet development to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of human iPSC lines from three independent donors, at baseline and at seven subsequent stages during in vitro islet differentiation. Differentially expressed genes (q   <   0.01, log2 fold change [FC]   >   1) were assigned to the stages at which they were most markedly upregulated. We used these data to characterise upstream transcription factors directing different stages of development, and to explore the relationship between RNA expression profiles and genes mapping to type 2 diabetes GWAS signals. RESULTS: We identified 9409 differentially expressed genes across all stages, including many known markers of islet development. Integration of differential expression data with information on transcription factor motifs highlighted the potential contribution of REST to islet development. Over 70% of genes mapping within type 2 diabetes-associated credible intervals showed peak differential expression during islet development, and type 2 diabetes GWAS loci of largest effect (including TCF7L2; log2FC   =   1.2; q   =  8.5   *   10-10) were notably enriched in genes differentially expressed at the posterior foregut stage (q   =   0.002), as calculated by gene set enrichment analyses. In a complementary analysis of enrichment, genes differentially expressed in the final, beta-like cell stage of in vitro differentiation were significantly enriched (hypergeometric test, permuted p value <0.05) for genes within the credible intervals of type 2 diabetes GWAS loci. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study characterises RNA expression profiles during human islet differentiation, identifies potential transcriptional regulators of the differentiation process, and suggests that the inherited predisposition to type 2 diabetes is partly mediated through modulation of islet development. DATA AVAILABILITY: Sequence data for this study has been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), under accession number EGAS00001002721.

29678908|t|The LIM homeodomain protein ISL1 mediates the function of TCF7L2 in pancreatic beta cells.
29678908|a|Pancreatic b-cell Tcf7l2 deletion or its functional knockdown suggested the essential role of this Wnt pathway effector in controlling insulin secretion, glucose homeostasis and b-cell gene expression. As the LIM homeodomain protein ISL1 is a suggested Wnt pathway downstream target, we hypothesize that it mediates metabolic functions of TCF7L2. We aimed to determine the role of ISL1 in mediating the function of TCF7L2 and the incretin hormone GLP-1 in pancreatic b-cells. The effect of dominant negative TCF7L2 (TCF7L2DN) mediated Wnt pathway functional knockdown on Isl1 expression was determined in bTCFDN mouse islets and in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 832/13. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation were utilized to determine whether Isl1 is a direct downstream target of Tcf7l2 TCF7L2DN adenovirus infection and siRNA-mediated Isl1 knockdown on b-cell gene expression were compared. Furthermore, Isl1 knockdown on GLP-1 stimulated b-catenin S675 phosphorylation and insulin secretion was determined. We found that TCF7L2DN repressed ISL1 levels in bTCFDN islets and the INS-1 832/13 cell line. Wnt stimulators enhanced Isl1 promoter activity and binding of TCF7L2 on Isl1 promoter. TCF7L2DN adenovirus infection and Isl1 knockdown generated similar repression on expression of b-cell genes, including the ones that encode GLUT2 and GLP-1 receptor. Either TCF7L2DN adenovirus infection or Isl1 knockdown attenuated GLP-1-stimulated b-catenin S675 phosphorylation in INS-1 832/13 cells or mouse islets and GLP-1 stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 832/13 or MIN6 cells. Our observations support the existence of TCF7L2-ISL1 transcriptional network, and we suggest that this network also mediates b-cell function of GLP-1.

29717269|t|Multiple genetic variations confer risks for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in arab descendants from UAE.
29717269|a|BACKGROUND: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the countries most threatened with obesity. Here we investigated associations between hundreds of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the following obesity indicators: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and height. We also investigated the associations between obesity-related genes with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We tested 87, 58, and 586 SNPs in a previous genome-wide significance level for associations with BMI (n   =   880), WC (n   =   455), and height (n   =   897), respectively. For each trait, we used normally transformed Z scores and tested them with SNPs using linear regression models that incorporated age and gender as covariates. The weighted polygenic risk scores for significant SNPs for each trait were tested with the corresponding Z scores using linear regression models with the same covariates. We further tested 145 obesity loci with T2DM (464 cases, 415 controls) using a logistic regression model including age, gender, and BMI Z scores as covariates. RESULTS: The Mean BMI was 29.39   kg/m2, and mean WC was 103.66   cm. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were common obesity comorbidities (>60%). The best associations for BMI was in FTO, LOC284260 and USP37, and for WC in RFX7 and MYEOV. For height, the best association was in NSD1 followed by MFAP2 and seven other loci. The polygenic scores revealed stronger associations for each trait than individual SNPs; although they could only explain <1% of the traits' Z scores variations. For T2DM, the strongest associations were with the TCF7L2 and MC4R loci (P   <   0.01, OR ~1.70), with novel associations detected with KCNK3 and RARB. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study of Arab descendants, we confirmed several known obesity (FTO, USP37, and RFX7), height (NSD1, MFAP2), and T2DM (TCF7L2, MC4R) associations; and report novel associations, like KCNK3 and RARB for T2DM.

29736187|t|<i>TCF7L2</i> correlation in both insulin secretion and postprandial insulin sensitivity.
29736187|a|Background: The <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 variant is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanisms involved in this association remain unknown and may include extrapancreatic effects. The aim of this study was to perform a metabolic characterization of T2DM patients with and without the <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 risk T allele and analyze some influences of the <i>TCF7L2</i> genotype on glucose metabolism. Methods: Patients with T2DM (<i>n   </i>=   162) were genotyped for the <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism. Individuals with CT/TT and CC genotypes were compared regarding basal serum levels of glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, HDL, uric acid, insulin, and C-peptide. A subset of 56 individuals was evaluated during a 500-calorie mixed-meal test with measurements of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide and glucagon. Additional secondary assessments included determination of insulinogenic index (IGI<sub>30</sub>), and insulin sensitivity (%S) and resistance (IR) by Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Results: Patients with the CT/TT genotype showed lower baseline plasma concentrations of C-peptide when compared with those with the CC genotype. Of the 56 individuals who participated in the mixed-meal test, 26 and 30 had the CC and CT/TT genotypes, respectively. CT/TT subjects, compared with CC individuals, had higher post prandial plasma levels of insulin and C-peptide at 30-120  min (p   <   0.05) and proinsulin at 45-240  min (p   <   0.05). Interestingly CT/TT individuals presented at baseline higher %S (p   =   0.021), and lower IR (p   =   0.020) than CC individuals. No significant differences in IGI<sub>30</sub> values were observed between groups. Conclusions: The T2DM individuals carrying the rs7903146 T allele of the <i>TCF7L2</i> gene presented higher IR pattern in response to a mix-meal test, different of beta cell function at baseline assessed by C-peptide levels which was lower, and Homa-IR was lower when comparing with non-carriers.

29802808|t|CYP2C9*3 gene variant contributes independently to glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with glibenclamide.
29802808|a|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Glibenclamide is a prescribed glucose-lowering medication for diabetes, but there are interindividual variations in the therapeutic response. In this cross-sectional study, the aim was to explore the association of genetic variants in CYP2C9, ABCC8, KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 with good glycaemic control in Mexican type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with glibenclamide. METHODS: Patients with T2D receiving treatment with glibenclamide or glibenclamide plus metformin were included. Patients with A1C  <=   7% were considered to have good glycaemic control, whereas patients with A1C  >=   8% were considered having poor glycaemic control. Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes for the genetic variants. Association was performed by calculating OR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For the multivariate analysis, a multiple logistic regression was performed including the confounding variables age, exercised, BMI, glibenclamide dose, time with T2D and concomitant metformin. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Four hundred and four patients were included in the study, median age of the participants was 50  years (IQR 11.0), the median time with disease was 6  years (IQR 8.0), 118 (29.2%) were men, and 243 (60.1%) received glibenclamide in combination with metformin. CYP2C9*3 variant was associated with good glycaemic control (OR  =  2.747 [95% CI, 1.194-6.324]), whereas the variants, CYP2C9*2, TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs12255372, ABCC8 rs757110 and KCNJ11 rs5219, were not. In the multivariate analysis, the CYP2C9*3 variant maintained its association (OR  =  2.779 [95% CI, 1.142-6.763]). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that CYP2C9*3 genetic variant independently contributes to good glycaemic control of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with glibenclamide.

29871606|t|Impact of KCNQ1, CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1, HHEX, MTNR1B, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and UBE2E2 on risk of developing type 2 diabetes in Thai population.
29871606|a|BACKGROUND: Several type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci identified via genome-wide association studies were found to be replicated among various populations. However, the influence of these loci on T2D in Thai population is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in GWA studies on T2D and related quantitative traits in Thai population. METHODS: Eight SNPs in or near the KCNQ1, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, TCF7L2, MTNR1B, and UBE2E2 genes were genotyped. A case-control association study comprising 500 Thai patients with T2D and 500 ethnically-matched control subjects was conducted. Associations between SNPs and T2D were examined by logistic regression analysis. The impact of these SNPs on quantitative traits was examined by linear regression among case and control subjects. RESULTS: Five SNPs in KCNQ1 (rs2237892), CDK2A/2B (rs108116610, SLC30A8 (rs13266634), TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and MTNR1B (rs1387153) were found to be marginally associated with risk of developing T2D, with odds ratios ranging from 1.43 to 2.02 (p   =   0.047 to 3.0   *   10-4) with adjustments for age, sex, and body mass index. Interestingly, SNP rs13266634 of SLC30A8 gene reached statistical significance after correcting for multiple testing (p   =   0.0003) (p   <   0.006 after Bonferroni correction). However, no significant association was detected between HHEX (rs1111875), CDKAL1 (rs7756992), or UBE2E2 (rs7612463) and T2D. We also observed association between rs10811661 and both waist circumference and waist-hip ratio (p   =   0.007 and p   =   0.023, respectively). In addition, rs13266634 in SLC30A8 was associated with glycated hemoglobin (p   =   0.018), and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 was associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p   =   0.023). CONCLUSION: Of the eight genes included in our analysis, significant association was observed between KCNQ1, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and MTNR1B loci and T2D in our Thai study population. Of these, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2 genes were also significantly associated with anthropometric, glycemic and lipid characteristics. Larger cohort studies and meta-analyses are needed to further confirm the effect of these variants in Thai population.

29931398|t|Advances in the Genetics of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes.
29931398|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on knowledge the role of genetics in youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence in youth of T2D, once thought to be exclusively a disease of adults, has increased by over 35% since 2001. Youth with T2D tend to have higher rates of complications, more aggressive disease, with more rapid loss of beta-cell function and a less favorable response to treatment than adults. Obesity is the most important risk factor for T2D, and the rise in childhood overweight and obesity appears responsible for the dramatic increase in T2D in youth. However, some obese children do not develop T2D, consistent with genetic differences in susceptibility to the disease in the setting of obesity and insulin resistance, currently far less well characterized in youth than in adults. Recent studies have begun to show associations of several established adult T2D genetic risk variants with youth-onset T2D and related glycemic quantitative traits, including the strongest known cross-population T2D genetic contributor TCF7L2. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a diabetes subtype distinct from type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D, is now known to result from a highly penetrant gene mutation in one of several genes. MODY has been shown to account for or contribute to at least 4.5% of clinically diagnosed T2D, even among those who are overweight or obese, impacting treatment decisions. The recently formed ProDiGY (Progress in Diabetes Genetics in Youth) Consortium is using genome-wide association studies and whole exome sequencing to understand the genetic architecture of T2D in youth, including how it differs from that of adults. The limited amount of research conducted to date on the genetics of youth-onset T2D, which tends to be a more aggressive disease than adult T2D, suggests some overlap with genes involved in adult T2D and a sizeable influence of highly penetrant monogenic diabetes variants. The ProDiGY Consortium is expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of youth T2D genetics.

29947923|t|Genetic variants of gestational diabetes mellitus: a study of 112 SNPs among 8722 women in two independent populations.
29947923|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy that has substantial short- and long-term adverse health implications for women and their children. However, large-scale studies on genetic risk loci for GDM remain sparse. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among 2636 women with GDM and 6086 non-GDM control women from the Nurses' Health Study II and the Danish National Birth Cohort. A total of 112 susceptibility genetic variants confirmed by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes were selected and measured. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was created based on variants that were significantly associated with risk of GDM after correcting for the false discovery rate. RESULTS: For the first time, we identified eight variants associated with GDM, namely rs7957197 (HNF1A), rs10814916 (GLIS3), rs3802177 (SLC30A8), rs9379084 (RREB1), rs34872471 (TCF7L2), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs11787792 (GPSM1) and rs7041847 (GLIS3). In addition, we confirmed three variants, rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153 (MTNR1B) and rs4506565 (TCF7L2), that had previously been significantly associated with GDM risk. Furthermore, compared with participants in the first (lowest) quartile of weighted GRS based on these 11 SNPs, the ORs for GDM were 1.07 (95% CI 0.93, 1.22), 1.23 (95% CI 1.07, 1.41) and 1.53 (95% CI 1.34, 1.74) for participants in the second, third and fourth (highest) quartiles, respectively. The significant positive associations between the weighted GRS and risk of GDM persisted across most of the strata of major risk factors for GDM, including family history of type 2 diabetes, smoking status, BMI and age. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this large-scale case-control study with women from two independent populations, eight novel GDM SNPs were identified. These findings offer the potential to improve our understanding of the aetiology of GDM, and particularly of biological mechanisms related to beta cell function.

29967064|t|Transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene acts downstream of the Lkb1/Stk11 kinase to control mTOR signaling, b cell growth, and insulin secretion.
29967064|a|Variants in the transcription factor-7-like 2 (TCF7L2/TCF4) gene, involved in Wnt signaling, are associated with type 2 diabetes. Loss of Tcf7l2 selectively from the b cell in mice has previously been shown to cause glucose intolerance and to lower b cell mass. Deletion of the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) leads to b cell hyperplasia and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, providing a convenient genetic model for increased b cell growth and function. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that Tcf7l2 may be required for the effects of Lkb1 deletion on insulin secretion in the mouse b cell. Mice bearing floxed Lkb1 and/or Tcf7l2 alleles were bred with knockin mice bearing Cre recombinase inserted at the Ins1 locus (Ins1Cre), allowing highly b cell-selective deletion of either or both genes. Oral glucose tolerance was unchanged by the further deletion of a single Tcf7l2 allele in these cells. By contrast, mice lacking both Tcf7l2 alleles on this background showed improved oral glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro compared with mice lacking a single Tcf7l2 allele. Biallelic Tcf7l2 deletion also enhanced b cell proliferation, increased b cell mass, and caused changes in polarity as revealed by the "rosette-like" arrangement of b cells. Tcf7l2 deletion also increased signaling by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), augmenting phospho-ribosomal S6 levels. We identified a novel signaling mechanism through which a modifier gene, Tcf7l2, lies on a pathway through which LKB1 acts in the b cell to restrict insulin secretion.

31938204|t|Long non-coding RNA MEG3 mediates high glucose-induced endothelial cell dysfunction.
31938204|a|Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in the progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) encodes an lncRNA which is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether MEG3 is a potential regulator and molecular biomarker of high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. LncRNA Meg3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and scrambled (Scr) siRNA were transfected for MEG3 dysfunction studies. RNA and protein expression were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cell viability was determined through MTT assay. This study demonstrates involvement of lncRNA MEG3 in high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. MEG3 is significantly downregulated in an endothelial cell model of hyperglycemia. In addition, MEG3 knockdown could exacerbate inflammatory damage in endothelial cells. Interestingly, MEG3 knockdown in HUVECs significantly induced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-2 and downregulating Bax, caspase-3, and P53. It should be noted that MEG3 knockdown could activate the TGF-b signaling pathway via upregulating TGF-b1, SMAD2, and SMAD7 and activate the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway via upregulating b-catenin and Cyclin D1 and downregulating TCF7L2. Our results indicate that MEG3 can be regarded as a novel therapeutic target and molecular biomarker for high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction.

29971604|t|TCF7L2 gene variants predispose to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus among individuals with metabolic syndrome.
29971604|a|INTRODUCTION: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants rs12255372 and rs7903146 have been consistently shown to raise genetic risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of these variants in the development of impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or T2DM, in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 228 patients with MS who were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 148 patients with MS and IGM [39M/109F, 59.8        14.6 (mean    SD) years] and the second group of 80 patients with MS and normoglycemia (NGM) (16M/64F, 56.1        15.8  years). The diagnosis of MS was based on the criteria proposed by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) Scientific Statement. Anthropometric parameters including BMI and waist circumference were recorded and blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting for biochemical tests. The rs12255372 and rs7903146 TCF7L2 polymorphisms were genotyped in peripheral blood leucocytes. RESULTS: Analysis of the distribution of the TCF7L2 polymorphic alleles revealed that the frequency of the T allele of the TCF7L2 variant rs12255372 was 38.2% in the study population, while the frequency of the T allele of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant was 35.3%. The T allele of the rs12255372 variant was more frequently present in patients with MS and IGM (48.3%) compared to patients with MS and NGM (19.4%, p   <   0.001). Also, the T allele of rs7903146 was more frequently present in patients with MS and IGM (44.6%) compared to patients with MS and NGM (18.1%, p   <   0.001). Logistic regression analysis followed and revealed that the presence of the T allele for both rs12255372 and rs7903146 TCF7L2 gene variants is a very powerful predictor of the presence of glucose disorders, increasing the risk more than fourfold in patients with MS and after adjustment for potential confounders, such as age, gender, BMI, and waist circumference (TCF7L2 rs12255372: Exp(B) 4.917, p   <   0.001 and TCF7L2 rs7903146: Exp(B) 5.460, p   <   0.001). CONCLUSION: The presence of the rs12255372 and rs7903146 TCF7L2 gene variants plays an important role in the development of T2DM among individuals with MS. These findings support the notion that among subjects with MS, those who finally develop T2DM have a genetic predisposition to b-cell dysfunction.

29977601|t|Controllability in an islet specific regulatory network identifies the transcriptional factor NFATC4, which regulates Type 2 Diabetes associated genes.
29977601|a|Probing the dynamic control features of biological networks represents a new frontier in capturing the dysregulated pathways in complex diseases. Here, using patient samples obtained from a pancreatic islet transplantation program, we constructed a tissue-specific gene regulatory network and used the control centrality (Cc) concept to identify the high control centrality (HiCc) pathways, which might serve as key pathobiological pathways for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). We found that HiCc pathway genes were significantly enriched with modest GWAS p-values in the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) study. We identified variants regulating gene expression (expression quantitative loci, eQTL) of HiCc pathway genes in islet samples. These eQTL genes showed higher levels of differential expression compared to non-eQTL genes in low, medium, and high glucose concentrations in rat islets. Among genes with highly significant eQTL evidence, NFATC4 belonged to four HiCc pathways. We asked if the expressions of T2D-associated candidate genes from GWAS and literature are regulated by Nfatc4 in rat islets. Extensive in vitro silencing of Nfatc4 in rat islet cells displayed reduced expression of 16, and increased expression of four putative downstream T2D genes. Overall, our approach uncovers the mechanistic connection of NFATC4 with downstream targets including a previously unknown one, TCF7L2, and establishes the HiCc pathways' relationship to T2D.

29993315|t|What Can Diabetes-Associated Genetic Variation in TCF7L2 Teach Us About the Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes?
29993315|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a polygenic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia occurring as a result of impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Among the various genetic factors associated with T2DM, a common genetic variant within the transcription factor 7-like 2 locus (TCF7L2) confers the greatest genetic risk for development of the disease. However, the mechanism(s) by which TCF7L2 predisposes to diabetes remain uncertain. Here we review the current literature pertaining to the potential mechanisms by which TCF7L2 confers risk of T2DM, using genetic variation as a probe to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

30006590|t|Down-regulation of vascular GLP-1 receptor expression in human subjects with obesity.
30006590|a|It has been thought that incretin signaling prevents arteriosclerosis, and very recently anti-arteriosclerotic effects through GLP-1 receptor were finally demonstrated in clinical human study. The purpose of this study was to investigate how vascular GLP-1 receptor expression is influenced in human subjects. First, we evaluated GLP-1 receptor expression in human arteries in immunostaining. Next, we separated the artery into the intima and media, and evaluated gene expression levels of various factors. We divided the subjects into obesity and non-obesity group and compared their expression levels between them. Finally, we evaluated which factors determine vascular GLP-1 receptor expression. GLP-1 receptor expression in intima and media was lower in obesity group compared to non-obesity group which was correlated with the alteration of TCF7L2 expression. Multiple regression analyses showed that BMI was an independent determining factor for GLP-1 receptor expression in the intima and media. Furthermore, using small interfering RNA method and TCF7L2-EGFP adenovirus, we showed that TCF7L2 was involved in GLP-1 receptor expression in human vascular cells. Taken together, vascular GLP-1 receptor and TCF7L2 expression was significantly down-regulated in human subjects with obesity. In addition, it is likely that TCF7L2 functions as a modulator of vascular GLP-1 receptor expression.

30050001|t|High-Throughput Approaches onto Uncover (Epi)Genomic Architecture of Type 2 Diabetes.
30050001|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. High-throughput approaches have opened a new avenue toward a better understanding of the molecular bases of T2D. A genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified a group of the most common susceptibility genes for T2D (i.e., TCF7L2, PPARG, KCNJ1, HNF1A, PTPN1, and CDKAL1) and illuminated novel disease-causing pathways. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based techniques have shed light on rare-coding genetic variants that account for an appreciable fraction of T2D heritability (KCNQ1 and ADRA2A) and population risk of T2D (SLC16A11, TPCN2, PAM, and CCND2). Moreover, single-cell sequencing of human pancreatic islets identified gene signatures that are exclusive to a-cells (GCG, IRX2, and IGFBP2) and b-cells (INS, ADCYAP1, INS-IGF2, and MAFA). Ongoing epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have progressively defined links between epigenetic markers and the transcriptional activity of T2D target genes. Differentially methylated regions were found in TCF7L2, THADA, KCNQ1, TXNIP, SOCS3, SREBF1, and KLF14 loci that are related to T2D. Additionally, chromatin state maps in pancreatic islets were provided and several non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) that are key to T2D pathogenesis were identified (i.e., miR-375). The present review summarizes major progress that has been made in mapping the (epi)genomic landscape of T2D within the last few years.

30058494|t|Genetic Aspects of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: A Mini-Review.
30058494|a|Diabetes is a multifactorial disease, caused by a complex interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors. Genetic determinants of particularly Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) have been studied extensively, whereas well-powered studies of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) are lacking. So far available studies support a clear genetic overlap between LADA and T1D, however, with smaller effect sizes of the T1D-risk variants in LADA as compared to T1D. A genetic overlap between LADA and T2D is less clear. However, recent studies, including large numbers of LADA patients, provide different lines of evidence to support a genetic overlap between T2D and LADA. The genetic predisposition to LADA is yet to be explored in a study design, like a genome- wide association study, which allows for analyses of the genetic predisposition independently of prior hypothesis about potential candidate genes. This type of study may facilitate the discovery of risk variants associated with LADA independently of T1D and T2D, and is central in order to determine if LADA should be considered as an independent diabetic subtype. Extended knowledge about the genetic predisposition to LADA may also facilitate stratification of the heterogeneous group of LADA patients, which may assist the choice of treatment. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of the genetics of LADA, and discusses the perspectives for future studies.

30063936|t|Association of Native American ancestry and common variants in ACE, ADIPOR2, MTNR1B, GCK, TCF7L2 and FTO genes with glycemic traits in Colombian population.
30063936|a|Insulin resistance and defects in other related glycemic traits are common findings in the context of Metabolic Syndrome. Although genetic factors are clearly implied in susceptibility, and some gene variants have been identified mainly in populations of European ancestry, little is known about this aspect in admixed populations. The association of insulin resistance, b-cell function, fasting insulin and glucose levels with 48 gene variants, previously related to metabolic syndrome components, and with the ancestral genetic composition, estimated on 50 ancestry informative markers, was evaluated in 417 individuals from the Colombian admixed population. The Native American genetic ancestry was associated with a low b-cell function (odds ratio (OR) of 1.73 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 1.07-2.81, p   =   0.026). Significant genotypic associations were obtained (q-value   <   0.05) for gene variants in ACE (rs4340; OR (95% CI): 2.79 (1.58-4.91), insulin resistance; mean difference (95% CI): 0.273 (0.141; 0.406), fasting insulin), ADIPOR2 (rs11061971; OR (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.48), low b-cell function), MTNR1B (rs10830963; mean difference (95% CI): 0.032 (0.013; 0.051), fasting glucose) and GCK (rs4607517; mean difference (95% CI): 0.038 (0.020;0.056) and rs1799884; mean difference (95% CI): 0.027 (0.013-0.041), fasting glucose). Also the well-known gene variants rs7903146 in TCF7L2, and rs17817449 in FTO, were nominally associated with hyperglycemia (rs7903146), as well as with higher fasting insulin levels (rs17817449). Our findings indicate that gene variants in ACE, ADIPOR2, MTNR1B, GCK, TCF7L2 and FTO, are associated with glycemic traits in the admixed Colombian population, while a higher Native American genetic component is related to lower b-cell function.

Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is shown to be associated with insulin secretion. Aim: To screen whether the gene variant of TCF7L2 (formerly TCF4) gene is significantly associated and has susceptibilities with type 2 diabetes in PCOS. This study is essential to uncover diabetogenic association of the TCF7L2 gene variants with PCOS. Design: This was a hospital-based study. Methods: In this work, blood samples from 43 PCOS patients with age and sex similar to 43 control samples were collected, followed by isolation of DNA. Further genotyping of the TCF7L2 gene was carried out by performing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Statistical Analysis: Genotype frequencies of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 gene were checked by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotype in both PCOS and the control group, and also, the frequencies of the genotype were performed accordingly. Results: There was no significant allelic variation observed among the patient and the control samples. From the patient details, it was observed that women between the age group of 21 and 25 years are susceptible to PCOS. Conclusion: From the PCR-RFLP analysis, it can be stated that there are no expected gene polymorphisms seen in this study, unlike the study carried out on the Chinese population where they observed genotype variations CC, CT, and TT. From this study, we can conclude that TCF7L2 rs7903146 gene cannot be considered as the candidate gene for the occurrence of PCOS.

30172742|t|Identification of novel variants associated with osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes and potentially pleiotropic loci using pleiotropic cFDR method.
30172742|a|AIMS: Clinical and epidemiological findings point to an association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and osteoporosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been fruitful in identifying some loci potentially associated with osteoporosis and T2D respectively. However, the total genetic variance for each of these two diseases and the shared genetic determination between them are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify novel genetic variants for osteoporosis and/or T2D. METHODS: First, using a pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method, we analyzed two GWAS summary data of femoral neck bone mineral density (FN_BMD, n   =   53,236) and T2D (n   =   159,208) to identify novel shared genetic loci. FN_BMD is an important risk factor for osteoporosis. Next, to explore the potential functions of the identified potential pleiotropic genes, differential expression analysis was performed for them in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as these cells are relevant to the etiology of osteoporosis and/or T2D. Further, weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify functional connections between novel pleiotropic genes and known osteoporosis/T2D susceptibility genes by using transcriptomic expression datasets in bone biopsies (E-MEXP-1618) and pancreatic islets (GSE50397). Finally, multi-trait fine mapping for the detected pleiotropic risk loci were conducted to identify the SNPs that have the highest probability of being causal for both FN_BMD and T2D. RESULTS: We identified 27 significant SNPs with cFDR<0.05 for FN_BMD and 61 SNPs for T2D respectively. Four loci, rs7068487 (PLEKHA1), rs10885421 (TCF7L2), rs944082 (GNG12-AS1 (WLS)) and rs2065929 (PIFO  PGCP1), were found to be potentially pleiotropic and shared between FN_BMD and T2D (ccFDR<0.05). PLEKHA1 was found differentially expressed in circulating monocytes between high and low BMD subjects, and PBMCs between diabetic and non-diabetic conditions. WGCNA showed that PLEKHA1 and TCF7L2 were interconnected with multiple osteoporosis and T2D associated genes in bone biopsy and pancreatic islets, such as JAG, EN1 and CPE. Fine mapping showed that rs11200594 was a potentially causal variant in the locus of PLEKHA1. rs11200594 is also an eQTL of PLEKHA1 in multiple tissue (e.g. peripheral blood cells, adipose and ovary) and is in strong LD with a number of functional variants. CONCLUSIONS: Four potential pleiotropic loci were identified for shared genetic determination of osteoporosis and T2D. Our study highlights PLEKHA1 as an important potentially pleiotropic gene. The findings may help us gain a better understanding of the shared genetic determination between these two important disorders.

30177026|t|TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism modulates the effect of artichoke leaf extract supplementation on insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
30177026|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2)-rs7903146 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The response of insulin and insulin resistance to artichoke leaf extract (ALE) may be affected by TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of ALE supplementation on metabolic parameters of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: This double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 80 patients with MetS in Sina Clinic, Khoy, Iran. The patients were randomized into ALE or placebo groups to receive either ALE (1800   mg/d as four tablets) or matching placebo for 12   weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric indices, blood pressure, glucose and lipid profile levels were measured before and after the study. Moreover, patients were genotyped for TCF7L2 polymorphism. RESULTS: ALE supplementation decreased insulin level and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients with the TT genotype of TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism (P   <   0.05). There was no significant interaction between blood pressure, glucose and lipid profile response to ALE supplementation. CONCLUSION: The responses of insulin and HOMA-IR to ALE supplementation have shown an interaction with single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in TCF7L2. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trial IRCT201409033320N9.

30190170|t|Novel epigenetic-sensitive clinical challenges both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
30190170|a|BACKGROUND: Epigenetics modulated tissue-specific gene expression during the onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and their complications. METHODS: We searched the PubMed recent studies about the main epigenetic tags involved in type 1 and type 2 diabetes onset and their clinical complications. PubMed studies about the epigenetic tags involved in type 1 and 2 diabetes onset was searched. RESULTS: The epigenetic methylation maps of cord blood samples highlighted differences in the methylation status of CpG sites within the MHC genes between carriers of diabetes type 1 DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 risk haplotypes. b cell-derived unmethylated INS DNA showed the decline of b-cell mass preserving insulin secretion. Differentially methylated regions in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetes covered PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5 promoters during islet dysfunction. The recruitment of SET7 and SUV39H1 histone methyltransferases and LSD-1 lysine-specific demethylase-1 at NF-kb-p65 promoter in vascular cells was involved in coronary heart disease. Neutrophil extracellular trap, activated by protein arginine deiminase-4, impaired wound healing from diabetic foot ulcers. MiR-199a-3p over-expression induced coagulative cascade, swelling and pain by a down-regulation of SERPIN-E2 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A DNA hypo-methylation and histone hyper-acetylation at MIOX promoter led an overexpression of ROS, fibronectin, HIF-1a, and NOX-4 associated with diabetic tubulopathy. A hypo-methylation of H3K4 at SOD2 promoter by LSD-1 increased ROS causing diabetic retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetics played a relevant role in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes.

30194258|t|Walking a fine line between b-cell secretion and proliferation.
30194258|a|Of the many common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, that in TCF7L2 remains the most studied because it has the greatest effect size. However, the mechanism by which this variant alters diabetes risk remains elusive. A new study adds another layer of complexity, suggesting that the effects of TCF7L2 are context-dependent, and highlights a novel interaction that might bias a b-cell to a secretory or proliferative phenotype. This in turn might open up new avenues to the restoration of insulin secretion in people with type 2 diabetes.

30212457|t|Exome sequencing-based identification of novel type 2 diabetes risk allele loci in the Qatari population.
30212457|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility is influenced by genetic and lifestyle factors. To date, the majority of genetic studies of T2D have been in populations of European and Asian descent. The focus of this study is on genetic variations underlying T2D in Qataris, a population with one of the highest incidences of T2D worldwide. RESULTS: Illumina HiSeq exome sequencing was performed on 864 Qatari subjects (574 T2D cases, 290 controls). Sequence kernel association test (SKAT) gene-based analysis identified an association for low frequency potentially deleterious variants in 6 genes. However, these findings were not replicated by SKAT analysis in an independent cohort of 12,699 exomes, primarly due to the absence of low frequency potentially deleterious variants in 5 of the 6 genes. Interestingly one of the genes identified, catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1, b-catenin), is the key effector of the Wnt pathway and interacts with the nuclear receptor transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), variants which are the most strongly associated with risk of developing T2D worldwide. Single variant analysis did not identify any associated variants, suggesting the SKAT association signal was not driven by individual variants. None of the 6 associated genes were among 634 previously described T2D genes. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that genes not previously linked to T2D in prior studies of European and Asian populations are associated with T2D in Qatar provides new insights into the complexity of T2D pathogenesis and emphasizes the importance of understudied populations when assessing genetic variation in the pathogenesis of common disorders.

30254725|t|Association of TCF7L2 mutation and atypical diabetes in a Uruguayan population.
30254725|a|AIM: To investigate if mutations in TCF7L2 are associated with "atypical diabetes" in the Uruguayan population. METHODS: Healthy, nondiabetic controls (n = 133) and patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 177) were selected from among the presenting population at level-3 referral healthcare centers in Uruguay. Patients with type 2 diabetes were subgrouped according to "atypical diabetes" (n = 92) and "classical diabetes" (n = 85). Genotyping for the rs12255372 and rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TCFTL2 gene was carried out with TaqMan   probes. Random samples were sequenced by Macrogen Ltd. (South Korea). Statistical analysis of the SNP data was carried out with the SNPStats online tool (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats). The best inheritance model was chosen according to the lowest values of Akaike's information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. Differences between groups were determined by unpaired t-tests after checking the normal distribution or were converted to normalize the data. The association of SNPs was tested for matched case-control samples by using   2 analysis and calculation of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were performed using SPSS v10.0 and EpiInfo7 statistical packages. Significant statistical differences were assumed in all cases showing adjusted P < 0.05. RESULTS: We genotyped two TCF7L2 SNPs (rs7903146 and rs12255372) in a population-based sample of 310 Uruguayan subjects, including 133 healthy control subjects and 177 clinical diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. For both SNPs analyzed, the best model was the dominant type: rs12255372 = G/G vs G/T+T/T, OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.40-0.98, P < 0.05 and rs7903146 = C/C vs C/T+T/T, OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.41-1.55, P = 0.3. The rs12255372 SNP showed high association with the type 2 diabetes cases (OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.20-2.51, P < 0.05). However, when the type 2 diabetics group was analyzed according to the atypical and classical subgroupings, the association with diabetes existed only for rs12255372 and the classical subgroup (vs controls: OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.21-3.75, P < 0.05); no significant differences were found for either SNP or atypical diabetes. CONCLUSION: This is the first time SNPs_TCF7L2 were genotyped in a diabetic population stratified by genotype instead of phenotype. Classical and atypical patients showed statistical differences.

30266127|t|Two TCF7L2 Variants Associated with Type 2 Diabetes in the Han Nationality Residents of China.
30266127|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of type II diabetes (T2D) with two transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) variants in the Han nationality population of Guangdong, China. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: International School, Clinical Laboratory of Over-sea Chinese Hospital, Department of Biochemistry, Medical School, Jinan University, China, from July 2014 to June 2016. METHODOLOGY: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of gene TCF7L2 were genotyped by PCR amplification and sequencing of the specific DNA fragments, rs7903146 and rs12255372, by PCR amplification and sequencing of the specific DNA fragments in 339 T2D patients and 191 control subjects. Odds ratio was determined. RESULTS: The minor allele of the two variants was significantly associated with T2D; the risk to develop T2D for rs7903146 (IVS3C >T) was found to be greater than that for rs12255372 (IVS4G >T), with allelic odds ratio (OR) of 1.39 and 1.27 respectively. Furthermore, T2D risk associated with homozygosity of the minor alleles was found to be greater than that for heterozygosity. CONCLUSION: The two varients of the gene TCF7L2 are important genetic risk factors for the T2D development in the Han ethnic group in China.

30275285|t|Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 (TCF7L2) Gene Polymorphism and Progression From Single to Multiple Autoantibody Positivity in Individuals at Risk for Type 1 Diabetes.
30275285|a|OBJECTIVE: The type 2 diabetes-associated alleles at the TCF7L2 locus mark a type 1 diabetes phenotype characterized by single islet autoantibody positivity as well as lower glucose and higher C-peptide measures. Here, we studied whether the TCF7L2 locus influences progression of islet autoimmunity, from single to multiple (>= 2) autoantibody positivity, in relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 244 participants in the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study with confirmed single autoantibody positivity at screening and Immunochip single nucleotide polymorphism data (47.5% male; median age 12.8 years, range 1.2-45.9; 90.2% white). We analyzed risk allele frequency at TCF7L2 rs4506565 (in linkage disequilibrium with rs7903146). Altogether, 62.6% participants carried >= 1 risk allele. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier statistical methods were used. RESULTS: During follow-up (median 5.2 years, range 0.2-12.6), 62% of the single autoantibody-positive participants developed multiple autoantibody positivity. In the overall cohort, the TCF7L2 locus did not significantly predict progression to multiple autoantibody positivity. However, among single GAD65 autoantibody-positive participants (n = 158), those who carried >= 1 risk allele had a lower rate of progression to multiple autoantibody positivity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, P = 0.033) than those who did not, after adjustment for HLA risk haplotypes and age. Among subjects who were either IA-2 or insulin autoantibody positive only, carrying >= 1 TCF7L2 risk allele was not a significant factor overall, but in overweight or obese participants, it increased the risk of progression to multiple autoantibody positivity (HR 3.02, P = 0.016) even with adjustment for age. CONCLUSIONS: The type 2 diabetes-associated TCF7L2 locus influences progression of islet autoimmunity, with differential effects by autoantibody specificity and interaction by obesity/overweight.

30290587|t|Associations of TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms with the risk of diabetic nephropathy: A case-control study.
30290587|a|The aim of the study was to explore the correlation between rs7903146 and rs290487 polymorphisms in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Chinese Han population.Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine genotypes of TCF7L2 polymorphisms in 90 patients with DN and 96 diabetes patients without DN. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis were performed with haploview software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in the control group based on the genotype distributions of TCF7L2 polymorphisms. The genotype, allele, and haplotype distribution differences between the case and control groups were analyzed by chi-squared test, and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to indicate the relative risk of DN.People carrying TT genotype of rs7903146 were more easily to be attacked by DN than CC genotype carriers (P=.02, OR=4.26, 95% CI=1.12-16.24). Meanwhile, T allele also showed 1.85 times risk to suffer from DN compared with C allele (OR=1.85, 95% CI=1.02-3.10). However, there was no significant difference in genotypes and alleles frequencies of rs290487 between 2 groups. The strong LD existed between the 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype T-T (rs7903146-rs290487) increased the susceptibility to DN (OR=2.63, 95% CI=1.31-5.25).TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism may be associated with the susceptibility to DN in Chinese Han population, but rs290487 is not. Additionally, haplotype is also a risk factor for DN.

30305909|t|Complex patterns of direct and indirect association between the transcription Factor-7 like 2 gene, body mass index and type 2 diabetes diagnosis in adulthood in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.
30305909|a|Background: Genome-wide association studies have implicated the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in type 2 diabetes risk, and more recently, in decreased body mass index. Given the contrary direction of genetic effects on these two traits, it has been suggested that the observed association with body mass index may reflect either selection bias or a complex underlying biology at TCF7L2. Methods: Using 9031 Hispanic/Latino adults (21-76  years) with complete weight history and genetic data from the community-based Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, Baseline 2008-2011), we estimated the multivariable association between the additive number of type 2 diabetes increasing-alleles at TCF7L2 (rs7903146-T) and body mass index. We then used structural equation models to simultaneously model the genetic association on changes in body mass index across the life course and estimate the odds of type 2 diabetes per TCF7L2 risk allele. Results: We observed both significant increases in type 2 diabetes prevalence at examination (independent of body mass index) and decreases in mean body mass index and waist circumference across genotypes at rs7903146. We observed a significant multivariable association between the additive number of type 2 diabetes-risk alleles and lower body mass index at examination. In our structured modeling, we observed non-significant inverse direct associations between rs7903146-T and body mass index at ages 21 and 45  years, and a significant positive association between rs7903146-T and type 2 diabetes onset in both middle and late adulthood. Conclusions: Herein, we replicated the protective effect of rs7930146-T on body mass index at multiple time  points in the life course, and observed that these effects were not explained by past type 2 diabetes status in our structured modeling. The robust replication of the negative effects of TCF7L2 on body mass index in multiple samples, including in our diverse Hispanic/Latino community-based sample, supports a growing body of literature on the complex biologic mechanism underlying the functional consequences of TCF7L2 on obesity and type 2 diabetes across the life course.

30419301|t|Genetic variation in TCF7L2 rs7903146 and history of GDM negatively and independently impact on diabetes-associated metabolic traits.
30419301|a|AIMS: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) later in life. Risk allele carriers at TCF7L2 rs7903146 have increased susceptibility for both GDM and T2DM. We hypothesized that carrying TCF7L2 risk alleles would further aggravate the negative impact of a positive history for GDM on metabolic traits related to T2DM later in life. METHODS: 210 women with a confirmed history of gestational diabetes and 810 controls without evidence for GDM underwent standardized 75   g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Liver fat was quantified in a subset of subjects (n   =   444) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: 504 women were homozygous or heterozygous risk allele carriers. The risk allele carriers had a higher risk for GDM (p   =   0.0076, OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.11-2.06). Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that both a history of GDM, or carrying a TCF7L2 risk allele resulted in lower insulin secretion, impaired proinsulin processing and higher fasting and 2-hour glucose levels. Liver fat content was not associated with either a history of GDM or a TCF7L2 risk genotype. There was no significant interaction (all p   >   0.05) between history of GDM and TCF7L2 risk alleles on all diabetes-associated metabolic traits tested. CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is a risk factor for gestational diabetes. However, the additional presence of TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk alleles does not further aggravate the negative impact of a history of gestational diabetes on metabolic traits related to T2DM.

30456822|t|Association of common type 1 and type 2 diabetes gene variants with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: A meta-analysis.
30456822|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the association of common type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) gene variants (protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 [PTPN22] rs2476601C/T, insulin [INS] rs689A/T and transcription factor 7-like 2 [TCF7L2] rs7903146C/T) with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted up to 2017 and data from 16 independent case-control studies for three gene variants were pooled. The pooled allele and genotype frequencies for each T1D and T2D gene variant were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. Heterogeneity tests and evaluation of publication bias were performed for all studies. RESULTS: In all, 8869 cases and 20   829 controls pooled from 16 case-control studies were included in the analysis. For rs2476601, a significant association was found for homozygote TT (OR 2.67; 95% CI 1.92-3.70; P   <   0.0001), heterozygote CT (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.44-1.79; P   <   0.0001), and the T allele (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.48-1.78; P   <   0.0001). Overall, a significant inverse association was observed for rs689 in the TT genotype (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.30-0.64; P   <   0.0001), AT genotype (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.45-0.62; P   <   0.0001), and T allele (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.52-0.71; P   <   0.0001). For the rs7903146 polymorphism, the T allele (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.00-1.40; P   =   0.04) may be associated with the risk of LADA. CONCLUSION: The rs2476601C/T, rs689A/T, and rs7903146C/T polymorphisms were found to be associated with the risk of LADA, thereby indicating that, genetically, LADA could be an admixture of both T1D and T2D.

30467975|a|The aim of this study was to ascertain the polymorphic markers profile of ADIPOQ, KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 genes in Kyrgyz population and to analyze the association of polymorphic markers and combinations of ADIPOQ gene's G276T locus, KCNJ11 gene's Glu23Lys locus and TCF7L2 gene's VS3C>T locus with type two diabetes (T2D) in Kyrgyz population. In this case-control study, 114 T2D patients 109 non-diabetic participants were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Two individual polymorphisms (ADIPOQ rs1501299, KCNJ11 rs5219) were found to be associated with T2D. We found two (Lys23Lys/CC and Glu23Lys/CT) of the overall nine combinations, which were more prevalent in T2D group compared to controls (  2 = 4.21, P = 0.04). Lys23Lys/CC combination was associated with a 2.65-fold increased likelihood of T2D (OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.12-6.28), whereas the Glu23Lys/CT combination also increased such likelihood (OR = 3.88, 95% CI 1.27-11.91). This study demonstrated some association of 276T allele and ADIPOQ gene G276T heterozygous genotype as well as KCNJ11 gene 23Lys allele with T2D in ethnic Kyrgyz, but study results should be interpreted with caution because of the limited statistical power.

30481877|t|[Genes and molecular mechanisms affecting the correlation between liver cancer and diabetes mellitus].
30481877|a|Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and high incidence disease in China. It is presently thought that diabetes is one of the independent risk factor for HCC. Diabetes and liver cancer are closely related, but the relationship and mechanism of diabetes and liver cancer are quite complex and controversial. Insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism disorders, and abnormal release of inflammatory mediators are the common bases of these two diseases. The molecular mechanisms of glycogen synthase kinase-3, toll like receptor 4, CCL5, CXCL14 and NCOA5, TCF7L2 genes affecting the correlation between liver cancer and diabetes mellitus are discussed and explained to provide the basis for the study and treatment of disease.

30564199|t|Blood-Based DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Type 2 Diabetes: Potential for Clinical Applications.
30564199|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It is a chronic metabolic disorder that develops due to an interplay of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The biological onset of the disease occurs long before clinical symptoms develop, thus the search for early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, which could facilitate intervention strategies to prevent or delay disease progression, has increased considerably in recent years. Epigenetic modifications represent important links between genetic, environmental and lifestyle cues and increasing evidence implicate altered epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation, the most characterized and widely studied epigenetic mechanism, in the pathogenesis of T2D. This review provides an update of the current status of DNA methylation as a biomarker for T2D. Four databases, Scopus, Pubmed, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar were searched for studies investigating DNA methylation in blood. Thirty-seven studies were identified, and are summarized with respect to population characteristics, biological source, and method of DNA methylation quantification (global, candidate gene or genome-wide). We highlight that differential methylation of the TCF7L2, KCNQ1, ABCG1, TXNIP, PHOSPHO1, SREBF1, SLC30A8, and FTO genes in blood are reproducibly associated with T2D in different population groups. These genes should be prioritized and replicated in longitudinal studies across more populations in future studies. Finally, we discuss the limitations faced by DNA methylation studies, which include including interpatient variability, cellular heterogeneity, and lack of accounting for study confounders. These limitations and challenges must be overcome before the implementation of blood-based DNA methylation biomarkers into a clinical setting. We emphasize the need for longitudinal prospective studies to support the robustness of the current findings of this review.

30600310|t|Impact of polymorphism of selected genes on the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
30600310|a|INTRODUCTION Although the coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be attributed to environmental risk factors common for both diseases, a genetic background should also be considered. Data on the role of genetic factors in the development of T2DM in patients with OSA are lacking. OBJECTIVES The study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence of polymorphisms of selected genes that are known to be associated with diabetes or obesity in patients with OSA and concomitant T2DM and to assess these polymorphisms in the context of OSA severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed OSA confirmed by polysomnography underwent genotyping for the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): SREBF1 rs11868035, HIF1A rs11549465, APOA5 rs3135506, TCF7L2 rs7903146, and FTO rs16945088. The frequency of genotypes was compared between patients with and without concomitant T2DM and was analyzed with regard to OSA severity. RESULTS A total of 600 patients with newly diagnosed OSA were enrolled to the study. Of these, 121 patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with T2DM (97 men and 24 women; median age, 58 years; range, 52-64 years). The prevalence of T2DM was significantly lower in APOA5 rs3135506 GG homozygotes than in CG heterozygotes (18.8% vs 33.3%, P = 0.02). APOA5 rs3135506 CG heterozygotes were at higher risk for developing T2DM (adjusted odds ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval,1.38-5.04; P = 0.003). No significant differences were found for the genotype distribution of the other investigated SNPs. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows a possible link between the polymorphism of the gene encoding APOA5 and T2DM in patients with OSA.

30614312|t|Relationship of lactation, BMI, and rs12255372 TCF7L2 polymorphism on the conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with previous gestational diabetes.
30614312|a|Women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM) have a high risk of developing postpartum type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to analyze the relationship between lactation, BMI, and TCF7L2 polymorphisms in the conversion to T2DM in women with pGDM. One hundred and fifty-three women con pGDM were recruited from public hospitals of Le  n Guanajuato M  xico. Three groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose intolerance (IGT), and T2DM after the oral glucose tolerance test were formed. Metabolic and hormone variables were measured, and genotyping was made by PCR-RFLP. The questionnaire included data on lactation (yes/no), duration of lactation, and full lactation. After 35 (21-49) months from the last partum, 54% of women had an NGT, 30.7% IGT, and 15% T2DM. BMI and rs12255372 are associated with the risk of conversion to IGT and T2DM [OR   =   1.07 (95% IC 1.0-1.14, p   =   .041; OR =2.14, 95% IC 1.01-4.55, p   =   .04 respectively), while the lactation shows a strong protective effects OR   =   0.15 (95% IC 0.062-0.39, p   =   .00007), and an apparent interaction with rs12255372T decreasing the risk in carriers (OR =2.15; 95% IC 0.97-4.7, p   =   .05). BMI is an independent risk factor of IGT/T2DM development. The lactation shows a strong protective effect and a possible interaction with rs12255372 polymorphism.

30656477|t|Genotypes of HLA, TCF7L2, and FTO as potential modifiers of the association between sweetened beverage consumption and risk of LADA and type 2 diabetes.
30656477|a|PURPOSE: Sweetened beverage consumption is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and LADA. We investigated to what extent this association is mediated by BMI and whether it is modified by genotypes of HLA, TCF7L2 rs7903146, or FTO rs9939609. METHODS: Swedish case-control data including incident cases of LADA (n   =   386) and T2D (n   =   1253) with matched population-based controls (n   =   1545) was used. We estimated adjusted ORs of diabetes (95% CI) in relation to sweetened beverage intake (per daily 200  mL serving) and genotypes. The impact of BMI was estimated using causal mediation methodology. Associations with HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were explored through linear regression. RESULTS: Sweetened beverage intake was associated with increased risk of LADA (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.29) and T2D (OR 1.21, 1.11-1.32). BMI was estimated to mediate 17% (LADA) and 56% (T2D) of the total risk. LADA was associated with risk variants of HLA (3.44, 2.63-4.50) and TCF7L2 (1.27, 1.00-1.61) but not FTO. Only among non-carriers of high-risk HLA genotypes was sweetened beverage intake associated with risk of LADA (OR 1.32, 1.06-1.56) and HOMA-IR (beta   =   0.162, p   =   0.0047). T2D was associated with TCF7L2 and FTO but not HLA, and the risk conferred by sweetened beverages appeared modified by FTO (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.21-1.73 in non-carriers). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that sweetened beverages are associated with LADA and T2D partly through mediation by excess weight, but possibly also through other mechanisms including adverse effects on insulin sensitivity. These effects seem more pronounced in individuals without genetic susceptibility.

30671104|t|Growing pigs developed different types of diabetes induced by streptozotocin depending on their transcription factor 7-like 2 gene polymorphisms.
30671104|a|The different polymorphisms of the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene promote variances in diabetes susceptibility in humans. We investigated whether these genotypes also promote differences in diabetic susceptibility in commercial pigs. Growing pigs (Landrace, both sex, 50-60 kg) with the C/C (n=4) and T/T (n=5) TCF7L2 genotypes were identified and intravenously injected with streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg) twice in weekly intervals, then a high-energy diet was offered. Oral glucose tolerance tests, blood analyses and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index calculations were performed. The animals were sacrificed at the end of 12 weeks of treatment to reveal the pancreas histomorphometry. The results showed that all of the treated pigs grew normally despite exhibiting hyperglycemia at two weeks after the induction. The glycemic level of the fasting or postprandial pigs gradually returned to normal. The fasting insulin concentration was significantly decreased for the T/T carriers but not for the C/C carriers, and the resulting HOMA-IR index was significantly increased for the C/C genotype, indicating that the models of insulin dependence and resistance were respectively developed by T/T and C/C carriers. The histopathological results illustrated a significant reduction in the pancreas mass and insulin active sites, which suggested increased damage. The results obtained here could not be compared with previous studies because the TCF7L2 background has not been reported. Growing pigs may be an excellent model for diabetic in children if the animals are genetically pre-selected.

30700996|t|Effect of TCF7L2 polymorphism on pancreatic hormones after exenatide in type 2 diabetes.
30700996|a|Background: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) stimulates insulin secretion and reduces blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism has been associated with decreased insulin secretion, reduced GLP-1 action, and possible impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity. Objectives: To evaluate the postprandial pancreatic hormone response in patients with T2DM carriers of the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 (CT/TT) compared with noncarriers of this variant (CC) after treatment with the GLP-1 agonist exenatide. Methods: Intervention study. Patients with T2DM (n   =   162) were genotyped for the TCF7L2 rs7903146 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Individuals with CT/TT and CC genotypes were compared regarding basal serum levels of glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), HDL, uric acid, insulin, and C-peptide. A subset of 56 individuals was evaluated during a 500-calorie mixed-meal test with measurements of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide and glucagon before and after treatment with exenatide for 8  weeks. Results: Patients with genotypes CC and CT/TT presented similar glucose area under the curve (AUC) 0-180  min before treatment and a similar decrease after treatment (p   <   0.001). Before exenatide, insulin levels at 30-120  min were higher in CT/TT versus CC subjects (p   <   0.05). After treatment with exenatide, only CT/TT individuals demonstrated insulin reduction at 30-180 min during the meal test (p   <   0.05). Patients with the CC genotype presented no differences in insulin concentrations before and after treatment. The areas under the glucagon curve between 0 and 180  min were similar before treatment and reduced after treatment in both groups (p   <   0.001). Conclusions: The presence of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele in patients with T2DM was associated with increased secretion of insulin response to a mixed-meal test. Furthermore, after treatment with exenatide, only the carriers of the T allele showed significantly decreased postprandial plasma insulin peak levels comparing with non carriers.

30702596|t|Association of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese Korean ethnicity population.
30702596|a|Presently, data on the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese Korean ethnicity are very scarce. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and T2DM in Chinese Korean ethnicity population. This case-control study involved 43 T2DM Chinese Korean ethnicity patients (T2DM group) and 43 healthy Chinese Korean ethnicity normoglycemic subjects as controls (Control group). All included participants aged from 40 to 75 years old. Clinical and biological data were collected to determine the phenotypic traits. The restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the TCF7L2 by genotyping for rs7903146 (C/T). Spectrophotometer with Chronolab kits was used to conduct the biochemical analyses. TCF7L2 was associated with T2DM in the Chinese Korean ethnicity population (P<.01 for alleles, and P<.05 for genotypes). Significant differences were found 2 groups regarding the T allele (37.2% T2DM patients vs 15.1% healthy subjects, P<.01), and G allele (62.8% T2DM patients vs 84.9% healthy subjects, P<.01). The risk genotypes were GG (83.7% T2DM patients, vs 44.2% healthy control, P<.01), GT (4.7% T2DM patients, vs 20.9% healthy control, P=.04), and TT (11.6% T2DM patients, vs 34.9% healthy control, P=.01). The results of this study demonstrated that TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM in the Chinese Korean ethnicity population, which is an important risk factor for T2DM in this population.

30708140|t|Identification and characterization of differentially expressed genes in Type 2 Diabetes using in silico approach.
30708140|a|Diabetes mellitus is clinically characterized by hyperglycemia. Though many studies have been done to understand the mechanism of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), however, the complete network of diabetes and its associated disorders through polygenic involvement is still under debate. The present study designed to re-analyze publicly available T2D related microarray raw datasets present in GEO database and T2D genes information present in GWAS catalog for screening out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identify key hub genes associated with T2D. T2D related microarray data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and re-analysis performed with in house R packages scripts for background correction, normalization and identification of DEGs in T2D. Also retrieved T2D related DEGs information from GWAS catalog. Both DEGs lists were grouped after removal of overlapping genes. These screened DEGs were utilized further for identification and characterization of key hub genes in T2D and its associated diseases using STRING, WebGestalt and Panther databases. Computational analysis reveal that out of 99 identified key hub gene candidates from 348 DEGs, only four genes (CCL2, ELMO1, VEGFA and TCF7L2) along with FOS playing key role in causing T2D and its associated disorders, like nephropathy, neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer via p53 or Wnt signaling pathways. MIR-29, and MAZ_Q6 are identified potential target microRNA and TF along with probable drugs alprostadil, collagenase and dinoprostone for the key hub gene candidates. The results suggest that identified key DEGs may play promising roles in prevention of diabetes.

30718095|t|Interaction analysis of gene variants of TCF7L2 and body mass index and waist circumference on type 2 diabetes.
30718095|a|BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease with numerous risk factors, including a growing number of genetic susceptibility variants. The TCF7L2 gene is closely associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but the association of TCF7L2 with weight-related traits in humans is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if TCF7L2 variants and body mass index/waist circumference (BMI/WC) act synergistically to influence the incidence of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. METHODS: This is a large sample, case-control study. We recruited 1842 Chinese type 2 diabetes patients and 7777 healthy controls and collected demographic and anthropometric characteristics and blood samples. We extracted DNA and genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs290487 in all participants. RESULTS: There were significant linear interactions between rs7903146 and BMI/WC and elevated blood glucose (P  <  0.001); rs290487 and BMI/WC also showed a linear interaction with blood glucose levels (P  <  0.001). The interaction was stronger at higher BMI (>21.02) and higher WC (>66.77  cm). The additive interaction of rs 290487 and overweight/obesity variables yielded a significant increase in the risk for T2D. RERI (relative excess risk of interaction) was 2.949 (95%CI: 1.700-4.198), AP (attributable proportion due to interaction) was 0.391 (95%CI: 2.281-0.502), and SI (synergy index) was 1.822 (95%CI: 1.463-2.268). Additionally, there was a significant interaction between rs 290487 and abdominal obesity on the risk of T2D (RERI: 2.642, 95%CI: 1.384-3.900; AP: 0.350, 95%CI: 0.231-0.468; SI: 1.675, 95%CI: 1.348-2.083). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a TCF7L2 gene-BMI interaction or gene-WC interaction may play an important role in the risk for T2D in the Chinese population.

30721637|t|TCF7L2 Expression Is Regulated by Cell Differentiation and Overfeeding in Human Adipose Tissue.
30721637|a|AIM: The TCF7L2 gene variant rs7903146 has the largest effect on type 2 diabetes risk reported in genome-wide association studies, however its role in adipose tissue development and function is unknown. We investigate the association between gene variant rs7903146 and metabolic parameters and examine in vitro and ex vivo gene expression of TCF7L2 in human adipose tissue and progenitor cells from two independent populations of young healthy men with increased risk of type 2 diabetes due to low birth weight (LBW). DESIGN: Adipose tissue biopsies were excised from 40 healthy young men with low and normal birth weights (NBW) after a control and 5-day high-fat overfeeding diet. In another cohort including 13 LBW and 13 NBW men, adipocyte progenitor cells were isolated and cultivated. Transcriptome-wide expression was performed on RNA extracted from biopsies or cell cultures. RESULTS: Diet-induced peripheral insulin resistance is more pronounced in carriers of the T-risk allele rs7903146, whereas no association with hepatic insulin resistance was shown. TCF7L2 expression increased during adipogenesis in isolated preadipocytes from both LBW and NBW men (p  <  0.001) and correlated positively with markers of progenitor cell proliferation and maturation capacity. In the mature adipose tissue, LBW men had lower expression of TCF7L2 compared to NBW men at baseline (p  =  0.03) and TCF7L2 expression was suppressed by short-term overfeeding in NBW men (p  =  0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a regulation of TCF7L2 expression during adipogenesis and in mature adipose tissue upon overfeeding, and further that young men exposed to an adverse intrauterine environment have reduced mature adipose tissue TCF7L2 expression.

30729689|t|Co-shared genetics and possible risk gene pathway partially explain the comorbidity of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
30729689|a|Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in treatment-naive patients are associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). SCZ, MDD, T2D, and MetS are often comorbid and their comorbidity increases cardiovascular risk: Some risk genes are likely co-shared by them. For instance, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9 (PSMD9) are two genes independently reported as contributing to T2D and SCZ, and PSMD9 to MDD as well. However, there are scarce data on the shared genetic risk among SCZ, MDD, T2D, and/or MetS. Here, we briefly describe T2D, MetS, SCZ, and MDD and their genetic architecture. Next, we report separately about the comorbidity of SCZ and MDD with T2D and MetS, and their respective genetic overlap. We propose a novel hypothesis that genes of the prolactin (PRL)-pathway may be implicated in the comorbidity of these disorders. The inherited predisposition of patients with SCZ and MDD to psychoneuroendocrine dysfunction may confer increased risk of T2D and MetS. We illustrate a strategy to identify risk variants in each disorder and in their comorbid psychoneuroendocrine and mental-metabolic dysfunctions, advocating for studies of genetically homogeneous and phenotype-rich families. The results will guide future studies of the shared predisposition and molecular genetics of new homogeneous endophenotypes of SCZ, MDD, and metabolic impairment.

30761081|t|A Perception on Genome-Wide Genetic Analysis of Metabolic Traits in Arab Populations.
30761081|a|Despite dedicated nation-wide efforts to raise awareness against the harmful effects of fast-food consumption and sedentary lifestyle, the Arab population continues to struggle with an increased risk for metabolic disorders. Unlike the European population, the Arab population lacks well-established genetic risk determinants for metabolic disorders, and the transferability of established risk loci to this population has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The most recent findings have identified over 240 genetic risk loci (with ~400 independent association signals) for type 2 diabetes, but thus far only 25 risk loci (ADAMTS9, ALX4, BCL11A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, COL8A1, DUSP9, FTO, GCK, GNPDA2, HMG20A, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, IGF2BP2, JAZF1, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, MC4R, PPARy, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, TFAP2B, TP53INP1, and WFS1) have been replicated in Arab populations. To our knowledge, large-scale population- or family-based association studies are non-existent in this region. Recently, we conducted genome-wide association studies on Arab individuals from Kuwait to delineate the genetic determinants for quantitative traits associated with anthropometry, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and blood pressure levels. Although these studies led to the identification of novel recessive variants, they failed to reproduce the established loci. However, they provided insights into the genetic architecture of the population, the applicability of genetic models based on recessive mode of inheritance, the presence of genetic signatures of inbreeding due to the practice of consanguinity, and the pleiotropic effects of rare disorders on complex metabolic disorders. This perspective presents analysis strategies and study designs for identifying genetic risk variants associated with diabetes and related traits in Arab populations.

30776466|t|Single and multi-locus association study of TCF7L2 gene variants with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in an Iranian population.
30776466|a|Prior studies indicated that some of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants such as rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11255372 are constantly associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in various populations and ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between TCF7L2 variants (rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs11255372) and T2DM by TaqMan assay. Statistical analysis was performed through SNPAlyze and SPSS. Significant associations of rs7903146 (P   =   1.9   *   10-7), and rs11255372 (P   =   2.98   *   10-10) both under a dominant model were found. Based on allele frequency, there was a significant difference between the two study groups at rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants (P   =   6.8   *   10-10, and P   =   9.3   *   10-11, respectively). Two haplotypes including Hap-1 (C-G-G) and Hap-2 (T-G-T) indicated a significant difference between the two study groups (P   =   1.174   *   10-9and P   =   7.432   *   109 respectively). In conclusion, rs7903146 and rs12255372 were significantly associated with T2DM in the specified Northern Iranian population.

30814579|t|Metabolites related to purine catabolism and risk of type 2 diabetes incidence; modifying effects of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism.
30814579|a|Studies examining associations between purine metabolites and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited. We prospectively examined associations between plasma levels of purine metabolites with T2D risk and the modifying effects of transcription factor-7-like-2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism on these associations. This is a case-cohort design study within the PREDIMED study, with 251 incident T2D cases and a random sample of 694 participants (641 non-cases and 53 overlapping cases) without T2D at baseline (median follow-up: 3.8 years). Metabolites were semi-quantitatively profiled with LC-MS/MS. Cox regression analysis revealed that high plasma allantoin levels, including allantoin-to-uric acid ratio and high xanthine-to-hypoxanthine ratio were inversely and positively associated with T2D risk, respectively, independently of classical risk factors. Elevated plasma xanthine and inosine levels were associated with a higher T2D risk in homozygous carriers of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 T-allele. The potential mechanisms linking the aforementioned purine metabolites and T2D risk must be also further investigated.

30824849|t|Lifelong physical activity is associated with promoter hypomethylation of genes involved in metabolism, myogenesis, contractile properties and oxidative stress resistance in aged human skeletal muscle.
30824849|a|Lifelong regular physical activity is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), maintenance of muscle mass and increased metabolic capacity. However, little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that might contribute to these beneficial effects in aged individuals. We investigated the effect of lifelong physical activity on global DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle of healthy aged men, who had either performed regular exercise or remained sedentary their entire lives (average age 62 years). DNA methylation was significantly lower in 714 promoters of the physically active than inactive men while methylation of introns, exons and CpG islands was similar in the two groups. Promoters for genes encoding critical insulin-responsive enzymes in glycogen metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle were hypomethylated in active relative to inactive men. Hypomethylation was also found in promoters of myosin light chain, dystrophin, actin polymerization, PAK regulatory genes and oxidative stress response genes. A cluster of genes regulated by GSK3b-TCF7L2 also displayed promoter hypomethylation. Together, our results suggest that lifelong physical activity is associated with DNA methylation patterns that potentially allow for increased insulin sensitivity and a higher expression of genes in energy metabolism, myogenesis, contractile properties and oxidative stress resistance in skeletal muscle of aged individuals.

30846969|t|Gene x Gene Interactions Highlight the Role of Incretin Resistance for Insulin Secretion.
30846969|a|Introduction: Genetic polymorphisms in TCF7L2 are the strongest common risk variants for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We and others have shown that genetic variation in TCF7L2 and WFS1 affect incretin-stimulated insulin secretion. A recent genome-wide association study discovered genetic variants associated with incretin levels. We hypothesized that these SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) interact with the well-known TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 on insulin secretion due to their incretin altering effect. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we used data from the cross-sectional TUEF-cohort (n = 2929) and a hyperglycemic clamp study using additional GLP-1 infusion at the end of the clamp (n = 76). Insulin secretion was measured by evaluating OGTT-derived indexes of insulin secretion and insulin/C-peptide levels during clamp. We genotyped rs7903146 in TCF7L2, rs10010131 in WFS1, and six SNPs associated with GLP-1 and GIP levels. Results: One of the six incretin-associated SNPs, rs17681684 in GLP2R, exhibited significant SNP x SNP interactions with rs7903146 in TCF7L2 on insulin secretion (p = 0.0024) after correction for multiple testing. Three further SNP's showed nominally significant interactions (p < 0.05). In the hyperglycemic clamp study, rs7903146 in TCF7L2 also interacted with rs17681684 on AUC C-peptide during the GLP-1 stimulation phase, thereby replicating the above finding. Conclusion: The findings exemplify the role of SNP x SNP interactions in the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and corroborate the existence of clinically relevant differences in incretin sensitivity.

30858716|t|Interaction between dietary patterns and TCF7L2 polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes mellitus among Uyghur adults in Xinjiang Province, China.
30858716|a|Purpose: This study aimed to characterize dietary patterns in the Uyghur population and examined the relationship between dietary pattern, TCF7L2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients and methods: Dietary patterns were defined using factor analysis, and associations between dietary patterns were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Genotyping of seven SNPs of TCF7L2 (rs11196205, rs12255372, rs12573128, rs4506565, rs7895340, rs7901695, and rs7903146) was conducted, and the association between these seven SNPs and the risk of T2DM was evaluated. Interactions between SNPs, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, and dietary patterns were also analyzed. Results: A total of 828 participants were enrolled in this study, including 491 people with T2DM and 337 healthy controls. Five dietary patterns were defined, and the results indicated that the "fruit" and "vegetables" dietary patterns were associated with a significant decrease in the risk of T2DM, whereas the "meats" and "grains" dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Moreover, the "dairy product" dietary pattern showed no association with the risk of T2DM. Furthermore, our results revealed that the TCF7L2 SNP, rs12573128, is associated with an increased risk of T2DM. SNPs rs4506565 and rs7903146 significantly interacted with dietary pattern. Conclusion: Our studies suggest that dietary pattern and genetic polymorphisms of TCF7L2 are associated with the development of T2DM in the Uyghur population of China.

30887699|t|Assessing the Role of 98 Established Loci for BMI in American Indians.
30887699|a|OBJECTIVE: Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies in Europeans have identified >  98 loci for BMI. Transferability of these established associations in Pima Indians was analyzed. METHODS: Among 98 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 82 had minor allele frequency  >=   0.01 in Pima Indians and were analyzed for association with the maximum BMI in adulthood (n  =  3,491) and BMI z score in childhood (n  =  1,958). Common tag SNPs across 98 loci were also analyzed for additional signals. RESULTS: Among the lead SNPs, 13 (TMEM18, TCF7L2, MRPS33P4, PRKD1, ZFP64, FTO, TAL1, CALCR, GNPDA2, CREB1, LMX1B, ADCY9, NLRC3) were associated with BMI (P     <=   0.05) in Pima adults. A multi-allelic genetic risk score (GRS), which summed the risk alleles for 82 lead SNPs, showed a significant trend for a positive relationship between GRS and BMI in adulthood (beta  =  0.48% per risk allele; P  =  1.6  *  10-9 ) and BMI z score in childhood (beta  =  0.024 SD; P  =  1.7  *  10-7 ). GRS was significantly associated with BMI across all age groups >=   5  years, except for those >=   50  years. The strongest association was seen in adolescence (age 14-16  years; P  =  1.84  *  10-9 ). CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, European-derived lead SNPs had a notable effect on BMI in Pima Indians. Polygenic obesity in this population manifests strongly in childhood and adolescence and persists throughout much of adult life.

30899283|t|Age at onset of obesity, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism, adiponectin levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes in obese patients.
30899283|a|Introduction: Interaction between obesity and genetic factors involved in the regulatory pathways of glucose homeostasis may play a significant role in diabetes development in the obese. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, adiponectin levels, age at onset of obesity and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a sample of obese Polish adults. Material and methods: A total of 474 unrelated obese subjects were included in this study. Real-time PCR was used to detect the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism. Serum level of adiponectin was determined by the ELISA method. Standard assays were used to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and HbA1c concentrations. We used multiple logistic regression to identify factors associated with type 2 diabetes. Results: We found that the T allele of rs7903146 was significantly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio of 1.59 for T allele, p = 0.005). This association persisted after adjusting for confounders in the recessive model (odds ratio of 3.54 for TT genotype, p = 0.011). Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic individuals (3.6 vs. 5.6   g/ml, p < 0.001). Participants who were obese at age >=  20 years had significantly higher odds of having T2D (OR = 4.94) than those with the onset of obesity before 20 years (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study highlights the significance of the relationship between the TCF7L2 polymorphism, a person's age at onset of obesity and the prevalence of T2D, and confirms lower adiponectin levels in obese diabetics in comparison to obese nondiabetics.

30948248|t|Targeted deletion of Tcf7l2 in adipocytes promotes adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired glucose metabolism.
30948248|a|OBJECTIVE: Activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway is known to inhibit differentiation in adipocytes. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the transcriptional network regulated by components of the Wnt-signaling pathway during adipogenesis and in adipocytes during postnatal life. The key intracellular effectors of the Wnt-signaling pathway occur through TCF transcription factors such as TCF7L2 (transcription factor-7-like 2). Several genetic variants in proximity to TCF7L2 have been linked to type 2 diabetes through genome-wide association studies in various human populations. Our work aims to functionally characterize the adipocyte specific gene program regulated by TCF7L2 and understand how this program regulates metabolism. METHODS: We generated Tcf7l2F/F mice and assessed TCF7L2 function in isolated adipocytes and adipose specific knockout mice. ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing was performed on the isolated adipocytes with control and TCF7L2 knockout cells. Adipose specific TCF7L2 knockout mice were challenged with high fat diet and assessed for body weight, glucose tolerance, and lipolysis. RESULTS: Here we report that TCF7L2 regulates adipocyte size, endocrine function, and glucose metabolism. Tcf7l2 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue, and its expression is suppressed in genetic and diet-induced models of obesity. Genome-wide distribution of TCF7L2 binding and gene expression analysis in adipocytes suggests that TCF7L2 directly regulates genes implicated in cellular metabolism and cell cycle control. When challenged with a high-fat diet, conditional deletion of TCF7L2 in adipocytes led to impaired glucose tolerance, impaired insulin sensitivity, promoted weight gain, and increased adipose tissue mass. This was accompanied by reduced expression of triglyceride hydrolase, reduced fasting-induced free fatty acid release, and adipocyte hypertrophy in subcutaneous adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Together our studies support that TCF7L2 is a central transcriptional regulator of the adipocyte metabolic program by directly regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.

30954515|t|Genetic polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes in the Arab world: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
30954515|a|AIMS: T2DM reach epidemic levels in the Arab countries. In this study, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to underline the susceptibility genetic profile of Arab patients with T2DM that result from SNPs. METHODS: We searched four literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science) through January 2019. We included all SNPs in candidate genes with an OR   >   1 that were associated with T2DM among Arab patients with T2DM. Statistical programs such as software Review Manager (Version 5.02) and STATA (Version 15.1) were used. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random effects model or a fixed effect model depending on the heterogeneity among studies. I2 statistics and Egger's tests were performed to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: Out of 2245 studies, 47 were used for meta-analysis. We captured 31,307 cases and 26,464 controls in which we collected 71 SNPs in 32 genes. A pooled meta-analysis demonstrated 24-69% increase in T2DM risk. Among the 57 SNPs (in 32 genes) that were not included in the meta-analysis, the OR for diabetes ranged from 1.02 to 5.10, with a median of 1.38 (interquartile range 1.33-2.09). Ten studies examined the association between the TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and T2DM, leading to an aggregated OR of 1.34 (95%CI 1.27-1.41). CONCLUSION: The genetic profile that confer susceptibility to T2DM in Arab patients is diverse. This study may serve as a platform for designing a gene panel for testing the susceptibility to T2DM.

30990791|t|A Clinical Evidence of a Correlation Between Insulin Resistance and the ALCAT Food Intolerance Test.
30990791|a|Insulin resistance (IR) is defined as the inability of a known quantity of exogenous or endogenous insulin to increase glucose uptake and utilization. Several mechanisms have been proposed as possible causes underlying the development of IR and the IR syndrome. IR occurs as part of a cluster of cardiovascular-metabolic abnormalities commonly referred to as "The Metabolic Syndrome." This may lead to the development of type 2 diabetes, accelerated atherosclerosis, hypertension, dysmenorrhea, hirsutism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome, depending on the genetic background of the individual developing IR. The aim of this study was to assess, in 123 female and 35 male (mean age, 42 y    10.3; range 19-75 y) volunteers) whether IR could be partly related to a dietary sugar intolerance and whether there could be a correlation between the ALCAT intolerance test and a mutation of the TCFTL2 gene (it promotes the trascription of the proglucagone and plays a key role in the development of the Langherans islands). Results evidenced that subjects with an intolerance to sugar, also showed a statistically significant complete or incomplete alteration of the TCFTL2 genetic test. Based upon these findings, our study demonstrated that there is a clinical correlation between the ALCAT food intolerance test and the IR. The positivity to the ALCAT test of one of the sugars tested (fructose, sugar cane, and sugar beet) indicates, in the majority of the subjects, the presence of a mutation of the gene TCF7L2 and could contribute to the prevention and treatment of the IR.

30708140|t|Identification and characterization of differentially expressed genes in Type 2 Diabetes using in silico approach.
30708140|a|Diabetes mellitus is clinically characterized by hyperglycemia. Though many studies have been done to understand the mechanism of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), however, the complete network of diabetes and its associated disorders through polygenic involvement is still under debate. The present study designed to re-analyze publicly available T2D related microarray raw datasets present in GEO database and T2D genes information present in GWAS catalog for screening out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and identify key hub genes associated with T2D. T2D related microarray data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and re-analysis performed with in house R packages scripts for background correction, normalization and identification of DEGs in T2D. Also retrieved T2D related DEGs information from GWAS catalog. Both DEGs lists were grouped after removal of overlapping genes. These screened DEGs were utilized further for identification and characterization of key hub genes in T2D and its associated diseases using STRING, WebGestalt and Panther databases. Computational analysis reveal that out of 99 identified key hub gene candidates from 348 DEGs, only four genes (CCL2, ELMO1, VEGFA and TCF7L2) along with FOS playing key role in causing T2D and its associated disorders, like nephropathy, neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer via p53 or Wnt signaling pathways. MIR-29, and MAZ_Q6 are identified potential target microRNA and TF along with probable drugs alprostadil, collagenase and dinoprostone for the key hub gene candidates. The results suggest that identified key DEGs may play promising roles in prevention of diabetes.

30718095|t|Interaction analysis of gene variants of TCF7L2 and body mass index and waist circumference on type 2 diabetes.
30718095|a|BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease with numerous risk factors, including a growing number of genetic susceptibility variants. The TCF7L2 gene is closely associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but the association of TCF7L2 with weight-related traits in humans is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if TCF7L2 variants and body mass index/waist circumference (BMI/WC) act synergistically to influence the incidence of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. METHODS: This is a large sample, case-control study. We recruited 1842 Chinese type 2 diabetes patients and 7777 healthy controls and collected demographic and anthropometric characteristics and blood samples. We extracted DNA and genotyped the TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7903146 and rs290487 in all participants. RESULTS: There were significant linear interactions between rs7903146 and BMI/WC and elevated blood glucose (P  <  0.001); rs290487 and BMI/WC also showed a linear interaction with blood glucose levels (P  <  0.001). The interaction was stronger at higher BMI (>21.02) and higher WC (>66.77  cm). The additive interaction of rs 290487 and overweight/obesity variables yielded a significant increase in the risk for T2D. RERI (relative excess risk of interaction) was 2.949 (95%CI: 1.700-4.198), AP (attributable proportion due to interaction) was 0.391 (95%CI: 2.281-0.502), and SI (synergy index) was 1.822 (95%CI: 1.463-2.268). Additionally, there was a significant interaction between rs 290487 and abdominal obesity on the risk of T2D (RERI: 2.642, 95%CI: 1.384-3.900; AP: 0.350, 95%CI: 0.231-0.468; SI: 1.675, 95%CI: 1.348-2.083). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a TCF7L2 gene-BMI interaction or gene-WC interaction may play an important role in the risk for T2D in the Chinese population.

30721637|t|TCF7L2 Expression Is Regulated by Cell Differentiation and Overfeeding in Human Adipose Tissue.
30721637|a|AIM: The TCF7L2 gene variant rs7903146 has the largest effect on type 2 diabetes risk reported in genome-wide association studies, however its role in adipose tissue development and function is unknown. We investigate the association between gene variant rs7903146 and metabolic parameters and examine in vitro and ex vivo gene expression of TCF7L2 in human adipose tissue and progenitor cells from two independent populations of young healthy men with increased risk of type 2 diabetes due to low birth weight (LBW). DESIGN: Adipose tissue biopsies were excised from 40 healthy young men with low and normal birth weights (NBW) after a control and 5-day high-fat overfeeding diet. In another cohort including 13 LBW and 13 NBW men, adipocyte progenitor cells were isolated and cultivated. Transcriptome-wide expression was performed on RNA extracted from biopsies or cell cultures. RESULTS: Diet-induced peripheral insulin resistance is more pronounced in carriers of the T-risk allele rs7903146, whereas no association with hepatic insulin resistance was shown. TCF7L2 expression increased during adipogenesis in isolated preadipocytes from both LBW and NBW men (p  <  0.001) and correlated positively with markers of progenitor cell proliferation and maturation capacity. In the mature adipose tissue, LBW men had lower expression of TCF7L2 compared to NBW men at baseline (p  =  0.03) and TCF7L2 expression was suppressed by short-term overfeeding in NBW men (p  =  0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a regulation of TCF7L2 expression during adipogenesis and in mature adipose tissue upon overfeeding, and further that young men exposed to an adverse intrauterine environment have reduced mature adipose tissue TCF7L2 expression.

30729689|t|Co-shared genetics and possible risk gene pathway partially explain the comorbidity of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
30729689|a|Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in treatment-naive patients are associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MetS). SCZ, MDD, T2D, and MetS are often comorbid and their comorbidity increases cardiovascular risk: Some risk genes are likely co-shared by them. For instance, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 9 (PSMD9) are two genes independently reported as contributing to T2D and SCZ, and PSMD9 to MDD as well. However, there are scarce data on the shared genetic risk among SCZ, MDD, T2D, and/or MetS. Here, we briefly describe T2D, MetS, SCZ, and MDD and their genetic architecture. Next, we report separately about the comorbidity of SCZ and MDD with T2D and MetS, and their respective genetic overlap. We propose a novel hypothesis that genes of the prolactin (PRL)-pathway may be implicated in the comorbidity of these disorders. The inherited predisposition of patients with SCZ and MDD to psychoneuroendocrine dysfunction may confer increased risk of T2D and MetS. We illustrate a strategy to identify risk variants in each disorder and in their comorbid psychoneuroendocrine and mental-metabolic dysfunctions, advocating for studies of genetically homogeneous and phenotype-rich families. The results will guide future studies of the shared predisposition and molecular genetics of new homogeneous endophenotypes of SCZ, MDD, and metabolic impairment.

30761081|t|A Perception on Genome-Wide Genetic Analysis of Metabolic Traits in Arab Populations.
30761081|a|Despite dedicated nation-wide efforts to raise awareness against the harmful effects of fast-food consumption and sedentary lifestyle, the Arab population continues to struggle with an increased risk for metabolic disorders. Unlike the European population, the Arab population lacks well-established genetic risk determinants for metabolic disorders, and the transferability of established risk loci to this population has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The most recent findings have identified over 240 genetic risk loci (with ~400 independent association signals) for type 2 diabetes, but thus far only 25 risk loci (ADAMTS9, ALX4, BCL11A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, COL8A1, DUSP9, FTO, GCK, GNPDA2, HMG20A, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, IGF2BP2, JAZF1, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, MC4R, PPARy, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, TFAP2B, TP53INP1, and WFS1) have been replicated in Arab populations. To our knowledge, large-scale population- or family-based association studies are non-existent in this region. Recently, we conducted genome-wide association studies on Arab individuals from Kuwait to delineate the genetic determinants for quantitative traits associated with anthropometry, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and blood pressure levels. Although these studies led to the identification of novel recessive variants, they failed to reproduce the established loci. However, they provided insights into the genetic architecture of the population, the applicability of genetic models based on recessive mode of inheritance, the presence of genetic signatures of inbreeding due to the practice of consanguinity, and the pleiotropic effects of rare disorders on complex metabolic disorders. This perspective presents analysis strategies and study designs for identifying genetic risk variants associated with diabetes and related traits in Arab populations.

30776466|t|Single and multi-locus association study of TCF7L2 gene variants with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in an Iranian population.
30776466|a|Prior studies indicated that some of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants such as rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11255372 are constantly associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in various populations and ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between TCF7L2 variants (rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs11255372) and T2DM by TaqMan assay. Statistical analysis was performed through SNPAlyze and SPSS. Significant associations of rs7903146 (P   =   1.9   *   10-7), and rs11255372 (P   =   2.98   *   10-10) both under a dominant model were found. Based on allele frequency, there was a significant difference between the two study groups at rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants (P   =   6.8   *   10-10, and P   =   9.3   *   10-11, respectively). Two haplotypes including Hap-1 (C-G-G) and Hap-2 (T-G-T) indicated a significant difference between the two study groups (P   =   1.174   *   10-9and P   =   7.432   *   109 respectively). In conclusion, rs7903146 and rs12255372 were significantly associated with T2DM in the specified Northern Iranian population.

30814579|t|Metabolites related to purine catabolism and risk of type 2 diabetes incidence; modifying effects of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 polymorphism.
30814579|a|Studies examining associations between purine metabolites and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited. We prospectively examined associations between plasma levels of purine metabolites with T2D risk and the modifying effects of transcription factor-7-like-2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism on these associations. This is a case-cohort design study within the PREDIMED study, with 251 incident T2D cases and a random sample of 694 participants (641 non-cases and 53 overlapping cases) without T2D at baseline (median follow-up: 3.8 years). Metabolites were semi-quantitatively profiled with LC-MS/MS. Cox regression analysis revealed that high plasma allantoin levels, including allantoin-to-uric acid ratio and high xanthine-to-hypoxanthine ratio were inversely and positively associated with T2D risk, respectively, independently of classical risk factors. Elevated plasma xanthine and inosine levels were associated with a higher T2D risk in homozygous carriers of the TCF7L2-rs7903146 T-allele. The potential mechanisms linking the aforementioned purine metabolites and T2D risk must be also further investigated.

30824849|t|Lifelong physical activity is associated with promoter hypomethylation of genes involved in metabolism, myogenesis, contractile properties and oxidative stress resistance in aged human skeletal muscle.
30824849|a|Lifelong regular physical activity is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), maintenance of muscle mass and increased metabolic capacity. However, little is known about epigenetic mechanisms that might contribute to these beneficial effects in aged individuals. We investigated the effect of lifelong physical activity on global DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle of healthy aged men, who had either performed regular exercise or remained sedentary their entire lives (average age 62 years). DNA methylation was significantly lower in 714 promoters of the physically active than inactive men while methylation of introns, exons and CpG islands was similar in the two groups. Promoters for genes encoding critical insulin-responsive enzymes in glycogen metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle were hypomethylated in active relative to inactive men. Hypomethylation was also found in promoters of myosin light chain, dystrophin, actin polymerization, PAK regulatory genes and oxidative stress response genes. A cluster of genes regulated by GSK3b-TCF7L2 also displayed promoter hypomethylation. Together, our results suggest that lifelong physical activity is associated with DNA methylation patterns that potentially allow for increased insulin sensitivity and a higher expression of genes in energy metabolism, myogenesis, contractile properties and oxidative stress resistance in skeletal muscle of aged individuals.

30846969|t|Gene x Gene Interactions Highlight the Role of Incretin Resistance for Insulin Secretion.
30846969|a|Introduction: Genetic polymorphisms in TCF7L2 are the strongest common risk variants for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We and others have shown that genetic variation in TCF7L2 and WFS1 affect incretin-stimulated insulin secretion. A recent genome-wide association study discovered genetic variants associated with incretin levels. We hypothesized that these SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) interact with the well-known TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 on insulin secretion due to their incretin altering effect. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we used data from the cross-sectional TUEF-cohort (n = 2929) and a hyperglycemic clamp study using additional GLP-1 infusion at the end of the clamp (n = 76). Insulin secretion was measured by evaluating OGTT-derived indexes of insulin secretion and insulin/C-peptide levels during clamp. We genotyped rs7903146 in TCF7L2, rs10010131 in WFS1, and six SNPs associated with GLP-1 and GIP levels. Results: One of the six incretin-associated SNPs, rs17681684 in GLP2R, exhibited significant SNP x SNP interactions with rs7903146 in TCF7L2 on insulin secretion (p = 0.0024) after correction for multiple testing. Three further SNP's showed nominally significant interactions (p < 0.05). In the hyperglycemic clamp study, rs7903146 in TCF7L2 also interacted with rs17681684 on AUC C-peptide during the GLP-1 stimulation phase, thereby replicating the above finding. Conclusion: The findings exemplify the role of SNP x SNP interactions in the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus and corroborate the existence of clinically relevant differences in incretin sensitivity.

30858716|t|Interaction between dietary patterns and TCF7L2 polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes mellitus among Uyghur adults in Xinjiang Province, China.
30858716|a|Purpose: This study aimed to characterize dietary patterns in the Uyghur population and examined the relationship between dietary pattern, TCF7L2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients and methods: Dietary patterns were defined using factor analysis, and associations between dietary patterns were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Genotyping of seven SNPs of TCF7L2 (rs11196205, rs12255372, rs12573128, rs4506565, rs7895340, rs7901695, and rs7903146) was conducted, and the association between these seven SNPs and the risk of T2DM was evaluated. Interactions between SNPs, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, and dietary patterns were also analyzed. Results: A total of 828 participants were enrolled in this study, including 491 people with T2DM and 337 healthy controls. Five dietary patterns were defined, and the results indicated that the "fruit" and "vegetables" dietary patterns were associated with a significant decrease in the risk of T2DM, whereas the "meats" and "grains" dietary patterns were associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Moreover, the "dairy product" dietary pattern showed no association with the risk of T2DM. Furthermore, our results revealed that the TCF7L2 SNP, rs12573128, is associated with an increased risk of T2DM. SNPs rs4506565 and rs7903146 significantly interacted with dietary pattern. Conclusion: Our studies suggest that dietary pattern and genetic polymorphisms of TCF7L2 are associated with the development of T2DM in the Uyghur population of China.

30887699|t|Assessing the Role of 98 Established Loci for BMI in American Indians.
30887699|a|OBJECTIVE: Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies in Europeans have identified >  98 loci for BMI. Transferability of these established associations in Pima Indians was analyzed. METHODS: Among 98 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 82 had minor allele frequency  >=   0.01 in Pima Indians and were analyzed for association with the maximum BMI in adulthood (n  =  3,491) and BMI z score in childhood (n  =  1,958). Common tag SNPs across 98 loci were also analyzed for additional signals. RESULTS: Among the lead SNPs, 13 (TMEM18, TCF7L2, MRPS33P4, PRKD1, ZFP64, FTO, TAL1, CALCR, GNPDA2, CREB1, LMX1B, ADCY9, NLRC3) were associated with BMI (P     <=   0.05) in Pima adults. A multi-allelic genetic risk score (GRS), which summed the risk alleles for 82 lead SNPs, showed a significant trend for a positive relationship between GRS and BMI in adulthood (beta  =  0.48% per risk allele; P  =  1.6  *  10-9 ) and BMI z score in childhood (beta  =  0.024 SD; P  =  1.7  *  10-7 ). GRS was significantly associated with BMI across all age groups >=   5  years, except for those >=   50  years. The strongest association was seen in adolescence (age 14-16  years; P  =  1.84  *  10-9 ). CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, European-derived lead SNPs had a notable effect on BMI in Pima Indians. Polygenic obesity in this population manifests strongly in childhood and adolescence and persists throughout much of adult life.

30899283|t|Age at onset of obesity, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism, adiponectin levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes in obese patients.
30899283|a|Introduction: Interaction between obesity and genetic factors involved in the regulatory pathways of glucose homeostasis may play a significant role in diabetes development in the obese. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, adiponectin levels, age at onset of obesity and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a sample of obese Polish adults. Material and methods: A total of 474 unrelated obese subjects were included in this study. Real-time PCR was used to detect the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism. Serum level of adiponectin was determined by the ELISA method. Standard assays were used to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and HbA1c concentrations. We used multiple logistic regression to identify factors associated with type 2 diabetes. Results: We found that the T allele of rs7903146 was significantly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio of 1.59 for T allele, p = 0.005). This association persisted after adjusting for confounders in the recessive model (odds ratio of 3.54 for TT genotype, p = 0.011). Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic individuals (3.6 vs. 5.6   g/ml, p < 0.001). Participants who were obese at age >=  20 years had significantly higher odds of having T2D (OR = 4.94) than those with the onset of obesity before 20 years (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study highlights the significance of the relationship between the TCF7L2 polymorphism, a person's age at onset of obesity and the prevalence of T2D, and confirms lower adiponectin levels in obese diabetics in comparison to obese nondiabetics.

30948248|t|Targeted deletion of Tcf7l2 in adipocytes promotes adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired glucose metabolism.
30948248|a|OBJECTIVE: Activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway is known to inhibit differentiation in adipocytes. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the transcriptional network regulated by components of the Wnt-signaling pathway during adipogenesis and in adipocytes during postnatal life. The key intracellular effectors of the Wnt-signaling pathway occur through TCF transcription factors such as TCF7L2 (transcription factor-7-like 2). Several genetic variants in proximity to TCF7L2 have been linked to type 2 diabetes through genome-wide association studies in various human populations. Our work aims to functionally characterize the adipocyte specific gene program regulated by TCF7L2 and understand how this program regulates metabolism. METHODS: We generated Tcf7l2F/F mice and assessed TCF7L2 function in isolated adipocytes and adipose specific knockout mice. ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing was performed on the isolated adipocytes with control and TCF7L2 knockout cells. Adipose specific TCF7L2 knockout mice were challenged with high fat diet and assessed for body weight, glucose tolerance, and lipolysis. RESULTS: Here we report that TCF7L2 regulates adipocyte size, endocrine function, and glucose metabolism. Tcf7l2 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue, and its expression is suppressed in genetic and diet-induced models of obesity. Genome-wide distribution of TCF7L2 binding and gene expression analysis in adipocytes suggests that TCF7L2 directly regulates genes implicated in cellular metabolism and cell cycle control. When challenged with a high-fat diet, conditional deletion of TCF7L2 in adipocytes led to impaired glucose tolerance, impaired insulin sensitivity, promoted weight gain, and increased adipose tissue mass. This was accompanied by reduced expression of triglyceride hydrolase, reduced fasting-induced free fatty acid release, and adipocyte hypertrophy in subcutaneous adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Together our studies support that TCF7L2 is a central transcriptional regulator of the adipocyte metabolic program by directly regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism.

30954515|t|Genetic polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes in the Arab world: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
30954515|a|AIMS: T2DM reach epidemic levels in the Arab countries. In this study, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to underline the susceptibility genetic profile of Arab patients with T2DM that result from SNPs. METHODS: We searched four literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Web of Science) through January 2019. We included all SNPs in candidate genes with an OR   >   1 that were associated with T2DM among Arab patients with T2DM. Statistical programs such as software Review Manager (Version 5.02) and STATA (Version 15.1) were used. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random effects model or a fixed effect model depending on the heterogeneity among studies. I2 statistics and Egger's tests were performed to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. RESULTS: Out of 2245 studies, 47 were used for meta-analysis. We captured 31,307 cases and 26,464 controls in which we collected 71 SNPs in 32 genes. A pooled meta-analysis demonstrated 24-69% increase in T2DM risk. Among the 57 SNPs (in 32 genes) that were not included in the meta-analysis, the OR for diabetes ranged from 1.02 to 5.10, with a median of 1.38 (interquartile range 1.33-2.09). Ten studies examined the association between the TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and T2DM, leading to an aggregated OR of 1.34 (95%CI 1.27-1.41). CONCLUSION: The genetic profile that confer susceptibility to T2DM in Arab patients is diverse. This study may serve as a platform for designing a gene panel for testing the susceptibility to T2DM.

30990791|t|A Clinical Evidence of a Correlation Between Insulin Resistance and the ALCAT Food Intolerance Test.
30990791|a|Insulin resistance (IR) is defined as the inability of a known quantity of exogenous or endogenous insulin to increase glucose uptake and utilization. Several mechanisms have been proposed as possible causes underlying the development of IR and the IR syndrome. IR occurs as part of a cluster of cardiovascular-metabolic abnormalities commonly referred to as "The Metabolic Syndrome." This may lead to the development of type 2 diabetes, accelerated atherosclerosis, hypertension, dysmenorrhea, hirsutism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome, depending on the genetic background of the individual developing IR. The aim of this study was to assess, in 123 female and 35 male (mean age, 42 y    10.3; range 19-75 y) volunteers) whether IR could be partly related to a dietary sugar intolerance and whether there could be a correlation between the ALCAT intolerance test and a mutation of the TCFTL2 gene (it promotes the trascription of the proglucagone and plays a key role in the development of the Langherans islands). Results evidenced that subjects with an intolerance to sugar, also showed a statistically significant complete or incomplete alteration of the TCFTL2 genetic test. Based upon these findings, our study demonstrated that there is a clinical correlation between the ALCAT food intolerance test and the IR. The positivity to the ALCAT test of one of the sugars tested (fructose, sugar cane, and sugar beet) indicates, in the majority of the subjects, the presence of a mutation of the gene TCF7L2 and could contribute to the prevention and treatment of the IR.

31037731|t|Transcription factor 7-like 2-associated signaling mechanism in regulating cementum generation by the NF-kB pathway.
31037731|a|Cementum regeneration is an important and challenging stage in periodontal tissue engineering and regeneration. Pathosis of the periodontium, including cementum, is important in precision diagnosis and obstinate treatment of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, leukemia, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Here, we found that during periodontium development, transcription factor 7-like 2 (Tcf7l2) was widely expressed in the periodontium and dental sac. In mouse cementoblast cell line (OCCM-30), the activation of NF-kB and cementoblast mineralization was significantly reduced when Tcf7l2 gene was silenced. Moreover, Tcf7l2 has a positive effect on NF-kB and cementoblast mineralization. Therefore, Tcf7l2 promotes cementum formation through the NF-kB pathway. In addition, we found a decreased expression of phosphorylated p65 and a thin layer of cementum in Tcf7l2fl/fl mice. These results suggest that Tcf7l2, which accelerates cementum formation by activating NF-kB, has great potential in the treatment of periodontitis and provide guidance for periodontal tissue regeneration.

31049566|t|Metabolomics Reveal Altered Postprandial Lipid Metabolism After a High-Carbohydrate Meal in Men at High Genetic Risk of Diabetes.
31049566|a|BACKGROUND: The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene confers one of the strongest genetic predispositions to type 2 diabetes, but diabetes development can be modified by diet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate postprandial metabolic alterations in healthy men with a high genetic risk of diabetes, after two meals with varying macronutrient content. METHODS: The study was conducted in 21 homozygous nondiabetic men carrying the high-risk (HR, n  =  8, age: 31.2      6.3 y, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) 28.5      8.1) or low-risk (LR, n  =  13, age: 35.2      10.3 y, BMI: 28.1      6.4) genotypes at the rs7901695 locus. During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics. Metabolic fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer. RESULTS: In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP)  =  1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP  =  1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP  =  1.1-1.3), as well as arachidonic (-36%, VIP  =  1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP  =  1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP  =  1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP  =  1.4-2.2), uric acid (-59%, VIP  =  1.5), and pyroglutamic acid (-65%, VIP  =  1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP  =  1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP  =  1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty acid amides were higher (51-508%, VIP  =  1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals. CONCLUSIONS: In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate lipid metabolism are induced by an HC-meal. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03792685.

31049640|t|Genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in Africa.
31049640|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for type 2 diabetes have uncovered >400 risk loci, primarily in populations of European and Asian ancestry. Here, we aimed to discover additional type 2 diabetes risk loci (including African-specific variants) and fine-map association signals by performing genetic analysis in African populations. METHODS: We conducted two type 2 diabetes genome-wide association studies in 4347 Africans from South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya and meta-analysed both studies together. Likely causal variants were identified using fine-mapping approaches. RESULTS: The most significantly associated variants mapped to the widely replicated type 2 diabetes risk locus near TCF7L2 (p   =   5.3   *   10-13). Fine-mapping of the TCF7L2 locus suggested one type 2 diabetes association signal shared between Europeans and Africans (indexed by rs7903146) and a distinct African-specific signal (indexed by rs17746147). We also detected one novel signal, rs73284431, near AGMO (p   =   5.2   *   10-9, minor allele frequency [MAF]   =   0.095; monomorphic in most non-African populations), distinct from previously reported signals in the region. In analyses focused on 100 published type 2 diabetes risk loci, we identified 21 with shared causal variants in African and non-African populations. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate the value of performing GWAS in Africans, provide a resource to larger consortia for further discovery and fine-mapping and indicate that additional large-scale efforts in Africa are warranted to gain further insight in to the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes.

31070566|t|Effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant on metformin response in patients with type 2 diabetes.
31070566|a|The response to metformin, the most commonly used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), is highly variable. The common variant rs7903146 C>T within the transcription factor 7 like 2 gene (TCF7L2) is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with T2D to date. In this study we explored the effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype on metformin response in T2D. The study included 86 newly diagnosed patients with T2D, incident users of metformin. Levels of fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and anthropometric parameters were measured prior to metformin therapy, and 6 and 12 months after the treatment. Genotyping of TCF7L2 rs7903146 was performed by the Sequenom MassARRAY   iPLEX   platform. At baseline, the diabetes risk allele (T) showed an association with lower triglyceride levels (p = 0.037). After 12 months of metformin treatment, the T allele was associated with 25.9% lower fasting insulin levels (95% CI 10.9-38.3%, p = 0.002) and 29.1% lower HOMA-IR index (95% CI 10.1-44.1%, p = 0.005), after adjustment for baseline values. Moreover, the T allele was associated with 6.7% lower fasting glucose levels (95% CI 1.1-12.0%, p = 0.021), adjusted for baseline glucose and baseline HOMA-%B levels, after 6 months of metformin treatment. This effect was more pronounced in TT carriers who had 16.8% lower fasting glucose levels (95% CI 7.0-25.6%, p = 0.002) compared to the patients with CC genotype. Our results suggest that TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant affects markers of insulin resistance and glycemic response to metformin in newly diagnosed patients with T2D within the first year of metformin treatment.

31083695|t|Assessment of TCF7L2 expression after bariatric surgery.
31083695|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of bariatric surgery on transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) expression and its association with body mass index (BMI) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Prospective study performed between 2016 and 2018, where 26 obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery were divided into two subgroups: diabetics and non-diabetics. The RNAs were extracted from peripheral blood samples that were obtained from each patient in two different moments: before surgery and after 12 months of follow-up. The relative expression of TCF7L2 was determined according to the delta-Ct method. RESULTS: The linear regression model of BMI x delta-Ct showed a positive correlation (p = 0.037). In the subgroups, an inversely proportional relationship was found between delta-Ct and BMI in the diabetic group and a directly proportional relationship in the non-diabetic group (p>0.05 in both). In the postoperative period, the regression model was similar to the preoperative, except when analyzing the subgroups, where diabetic patients showed a directly proportional relationship (p>0.05). The relative expression of TCF7L2 showed an average of 1.16    0.91, CI-95% 0.79-1.53. There was an increase in relative expression of 48% in the non-diabetic group (p = 0.021), and a decrease of 27% in the T2DM group (p>0.05) in the postoperative. There was a positive correlation between a greater decrease in BMI and increased relative expression (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that generally, the TCF7L2 expression increase with a decrease in BMI, however, for patients with T2DM, it exhibits an inverse pattern, which is normalized one year after bariatric surgery.

31089877|t|Narrowband UVB treatment induces expression of WNT7B, WNT10B and TCF7L2 in psoriasis skin.
31089877|a|WNT/b-catenin signaling pathways play a pivotal role in the human immune defense against infections and in chronic inflammatory conditions as psoriasis. Wnt gene alterations are linked to known comorbidities of psoriasis as obesity, diabetes and Crohn's disease. The objective of this study was to investigate WNT7B, WNT10B, WNT16 and TCF7L2 gene and protein expression in lesional and non-lesional skin and in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis compared with healthy individuals. To investigate the effect of narrowband UVB radiation, expression of these genes were analyzed before and after narrowband UVB treatment. Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms for WNT7B, WNT10B, WNT16 and TCF7L2 genes and psoriasis were tested. Our results show significantly decreased WNT7B, WNT10B and TCF7L2 gene expression in lesional skin compared with non-lesional skin and healthy controls. Narrowband UVB treatment significantly increased expression of these genes in lesional skin. Immunohistochemistry shows increased WNT16 expression in lesional skin. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for Wnt or TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms were found between patient and control group. This study shows for the first time significant UVB induced upregulation of WNT7B, WNT10B and TCF7L2 in patients with psoriasis and suggests a potential role of these genes in psoriasis pathogenesis.

31098383|t|Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in CDKAL1 Gene Are Associated with Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Population.
31098383|a|Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing public health concern for many reasons, and its etiology remains unclear. Due to the similarity of its pathophysiology with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we evaluated the relationship between published T2DM susceptibility genes and the risk of GDM. A total of 303 SNPs from genes including IRS1, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, GCK, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ11 and the risk of GDM were examined in a nested case-control study with 321 GDM cases and 316 controls. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by unconditional logistical regression as a measure of the associations between genotypes and GDM in additive, recessive, dominant, and codominant models adjusting for maternal age, maternal BMI, parity, and family history of diabetes. At the gene level, CDKAL1 was associated with GDM risk. SNPs in the CDKAL1 gene including rs4712527, rs7748720, rs9350276, and rs6938256 were associated with reduced GDM risk. However, SNPs including rs9295478, rs6935599, and rs7747752 were associated with elevated GDM risk. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, rs9295478 and rs6935599 were still significant across the additive, recessive, and codominant models; rs7748720 and rs6938256 were significant in dominant and codominant models; and rs4712527 was only significant in the codominant model. Our study provides evidence for an association between the CDKAL1 gene and risk of GDM. However, its role in the GDM pathogenesis still needs to be verified by further studies.

31121319|t|Association of transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) polymorphisms with stress-related hyperglycaemia (SRH) in intensive care and resulting outcomes: The READIAB study.
31121319|a|OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 on the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene in stress-related hyperglycaemia (SRH), defined as blood glucose>= 11mmol/L in at least two blood samples during the first 3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), and on 28-day and 1-year mortality, and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) at 6 months and 1 year in patients hospitalized in the ICU. METHODS: This prospective observational (non-interventional) multicentre READIAB study, carried out during 2012-2016 in six French ICUs, involved adult patients admitted to ICUs for at least two organ failures; patients admitted for<48h were excluded. During the 3-day ICU observational period, genetic testing, blood glucose values and insulin treatment were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: The association of rs7903146 with SRH was assessed using logistic regression models. Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed the associations between rs7903146 and mortality and between SRH and mortality, both at 28 days and 1 year. A total of 991 of the 1000 enrolled patients were included in the READIAB-G4 cohort, but 242 (24.4%) had preexisting diabetes and were excluded from the analyses. SRH occurred within the first 3 days in the ICU for one-third of the non-diabetes patients. The association between the rs7903146 polymorphism and SRH did not reach significance (P=0.078): OR(peroneTcopy): 1.24, 95% CI: 0.98-1.58. A significant association was found between rs7903146 and 28-day mortality after adjusting for severity scores (P=0.026), but was no longer significant at 1 year (P=0.61). At 28 days, mortality was increased in patients with SRH (HR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.43-3.06; P<0.001), and remained significant at 1 year after adjusting for severity scores (HR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.32-2.28; P<0.001). On admission, non-diabetes patients with SRH had a higher incidence of T2D at 6 months vs. those without SRH (16.0% vs. 7.6%, RR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.07-4.20; P=0.030). At 1 year, these figures were 13.4% vs. 9.2%, RR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.71-2.96; P=0.31). Moreover, the rs7903146 polymorphism was not significantly associated with T2D development at either 6 months (P=0.72) or 1 year (P=0.64). CONCLUSION: This study failed to demonstrate any significant association between rs7903146 and SRH. Nevertheless, the issue remains an important challenge, as SRH may be associated with increased rates of both mortality and T2D development.

31122183|t|The Importance of Precision Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM): From Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacoepigenetic Aspects.
31122183|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide disorder as the most important challenges of health-care systems. Controlling the normal glycaemia greatly profit long-term prognosis and gives explanation for early, effective, constant, and safe intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Finding the main genetic and epigenetic profile of T2DM and the exact molecular targets of T2DM medications can shed a light to its personalized management. The comprehensive information of T2DM was earned through the genome-wide association study (GWAS) studies. In the current review we represent the most important candidate genes of T2DM like CAPN10, TCF7L2, PPAR-  , IRSs, KCNJ11, WFS1, and HNF homeoboxes. Different genetic variations of candidate gene can predict the efficacy of T2DM personalized strategy medication. RESULTS: SLCs and AMPK variations are considered for metformin, CYP2C9, KATP channel, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and KCNQ1 for sulphonylureas, OATP1B, and KCNQ1 for repaglinide and the last but not the least ADIPOQ, PPAR-  , SLC, CYP2C8, and SLCO1B1 for thiazolidinediones response prediction. CONCLUSION: Taken everything into the consideration, there is an extreme need to determine the genetic status of T2DM patients in some known genetic region before planning the medication strategies.

31123324|t|ATAC-seq reveals alterations in open chromatin in pancreatic islets from subjects with type 2 diabetes.
31123324|a|Impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Altered chromatin structure may contribute to the disease. We therefore studied the impact of T2D on open chromatin in human pancreatic islets. We used assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to profile open chromatin in islets from T2D and non-diabetic donors. We identified 57,105 and 53,284 ATAC-seq peaks representing open chromatin regions in islets of non-diabetic and diabetic donors, respectively. The majority of ATAC-seq peaks mapped near transcription start sites. Additionally, peaks were enriched in enhancer regions and in regions where islet-specific transcription factors (TFs), e.g. FOXA2, MAFB, NKX2.2, NKX6.1 and PDX1, bind. Islet ATAC-seq peaks overlap with 13 SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs7903146, rs2237897, rs757209, rs11708067 and rs878521 near TCF7L2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, ADCY5 and GCK, respectively) and with additional 67 SNPs in LD with known T2D SNPs (e.g. SNPs annotated to GIPR, KCNJ11, GLIS3, IGF2BP2, FTO and PPARG). There was enrichment of open chromatin regions near highly expressed genes in human islets. Moreover, 1,078 open chromatin peaks, annotated to 898 genes, differed in prevalence between diabetic and non-diabetic islet donors. Some of these peaks are annotated to candidate genes for T2D and islet dysfunction (e.g. HHEX, HMGA2, GLIS3, MTNR1B and PARK2) and some overlap with SNPs associated with T2D (e.g. rs3821943 near WFS1 and rs508419 near ANK1). Enhancer regions and motifs specific to key TFs including BACH2, FOXO1, FOXA2, NEUROD1, MAFA and PDX1 were enriched in differential islet ATAC-seq peaks of T2D versus non-diabetic donors. Our study provides new understanding into how T2D alters the chromatin landscape, and thereby accessibility for TFs and gene expression, in human pancreatic islets.

31125083|t|Interaction Between Overweight and Genotypes of HLA, TCF7L2, and FTO in Relation to the Risk of Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults and Type 2 Diabetes.
31125083|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated potential interactions between body mass index (BMI) and genotypes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), TCF7L2-rs7903146, and FTO-rs9939609 in relation to the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We pooled data from two population-based studies: (i) a Swedish study with incident cases of LADA [positive for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA); n = 394) and type 2 diabetes (negative for GADA; n = 1290) and matched controls without diabetes (n = 2656) and (ii) a prospective Norwegian study that included incident cases of LADA (n = 131) and type 2 diabetes (n = 1901) and 886,120 person-years of follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, and smoking. Interaction between overweight (BMI >=  25 kg/m2) and HLA/TCF7L2/FTO high-risk genotypes was assessed by attributable proportion due to interaction (AP). RESULTS: The combination of overweight and high-risk genotypes of HLA, TCF7L2, and FTO was associated with pooled relative risk (RRpooled) of 7.59 (95% CI, 5.27 to 10.93), 2.65 (95% CI, 1.97 to 3.56), and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.60 to 3.07), respectively, for LADA, compared with normal-weight individuals with low/intermediate genetic risk. There was a significant interaction between overweight and HLA (AP, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.47), TCF7L2 (AP, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.52), and FTO (AP, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.61). The highest risk of LADA was seen in overweight individuals homozygous for the DR4 genotype [RR, 26.76 (95% CI, 15.42 to 46.43); AP, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.83) (Swedish data)]. Overweight and TCF7L2 also significantly interacted in relation to type 2 diabetes (AP, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.33), but no interaction was observed with high-risk genotypes of HLA or FTO. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight interacts with HLA high-risk genotypes but also with genes associated with type 2 diabetes in the promotion of LADA.

31167894|t|The Influence of Type 2 Diabetes-Associated Factors on Type 1 Diabetes.
31167894|a|Current efforts to prevent progression from islet autoimmunity to type 1 diabetes largely focus on immunomodulatory approaches. However, emerging data suggest that the development of diabetes in islet autoantibody-positive individuals may also involve factors such as obesity and genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, and the influence of these factors increases with age at diagnosis. Although these factors have been linked with metabolic outcomes, particularly through their impact on b-cell function and insulin sensitivity, growing evidence suggests that they might also interact with the immune system to amplify the autoimmune response. The presence of factors shared by both forms of diabetes contributes to disease heterogeneity and thus has important implications. Characteristics that are typically considered to be nonimmune should be incorporated into predictive algorithms that seek to identify at-risk individuals and into the designs of trials for disease prevention. The heterogeneity of diabetes also poses a challenge in diagnostic classification. Finally, after clinically diagnosing type 1 diabetes, addressing nonimmune elements may help to prevent further deterioration of b-cell function and thus improve clinical outcomes. This Perspectives in Care article highlights the role of type 2 diabetes-associated genetic factors (e.g., gene variants at transcription factor 7-like 2 [TCF7L2]) and obesity (via insulin resistance, inflammation, b-cell stress, or all three) in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and their impacts on age at diagnosis. Recognizing that type 1 diabetes might result from the sum of effects from islet autoimmunity and type 2 diabetes-associated factors, their interactions, or both affects disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

31196130|t|Dam mutants provide improved sensitivity and spatial resolution for profiling transcription factor binding.
31196130|a|DamID, in which a protein of interest is fused to Dam methylase, enables mapping of protein-DNA binding through readout of adenine methylation in genomic DNA. DamID offers a compelling alternative to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), particularly in cases where cell number or antibody availability is limiting. This comes at a cost, however, of high non-specific signal and a lowered spatial resolution of several kb, limiting its application to transcription factor-DNA binding. Here we show that mutations in Dam, when fused to the transcription factor Tcf7l2, greatly reduce non-specific methylation. Combined with a simplified DamID sequencing protocol, we find that these Dam mutants allow for accurate detection of transcription factor binding at a sensitivity and spatial resolution closely matching that seen in ChIP-seq.

31288068|t|A meta-analysis on genetic associations between Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
31288068|a|BACKGROUND: Some previous studies already explored associations of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with conflicting findings. Here, we aimed to better analyze the relationship between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and T2DM in a larger combined population by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI for related articles. We calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate whether there are genetic associations between TCF7L2 polymorphisms and T2DM. RESULTS: Totally 42 studies were included for this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results demonstrated that TCF7L2 rs4506565, rs7901695, rs11196205 and rs12255372 polymorphisms were all significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in general population. Further subgroup analyses revealed similar significant findings in both Asians and Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings supported that these TCF7L2 polymorphisms could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing T2DM.

31288725|t|The Association of Transcription Factor 7 like 2 Gene Polymorphism with Diabetic Nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
31288725|a|BACKGROUND: The exact relationship between the different TCF7L2 gene polymorphisms and the development diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: to investigate the association of TCF7L2 rs12255372 (G/T) gene polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: 100 patients with T2D (50 patients without DN and 50 patients with DN) and 50 age and sex matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in the study. Genotyping for the rs12255372(G>T) polymorphism in TCF7L2 gene was performed by real time PCR. RESULTS: The rs12255372 polymorphism showed statistically significant difference between HC and patients with and without DN in both the genotype and allele frequency. However, the rs12255372 polymorphism genotype or allele frequency were not statistically different between patients with DN and those patients without DN. The G allele was found to be higher in patients and the T allele was higher in HC suggesting that the G allele was the risky allele for developing T2D _ DN and that the T allele was protective. CONCLUSION: rs12255372 TCF7L2 gene polymorphism was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DN. The association between rs12255372 polymorphism and DN was a mere reflection of a complicated diabetes mellitus rather than a direct independent association.

31312258|t|TCF7L2 regulates pancreatic b-cell function through PI3K/AKT signal pathway.
31312258|a|Background: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), which previously known as TCF-4, is a major form of transcription factor involved in the downstream WNT signaling and exhibits the strongest association to diabetes susceptibility. Although we still do not know mechanistically how TCF7L2 exerts its physiological functions on pancreatic endocrine cells, it had been suggested that TCF7L2 may directly affect b-cell function by regulating the activation of  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Methods: MIN6 cells were transfected with TCF7L2 knockdown virus or lenti-TCF7L2 virus for 48  h to evaluate the contribution of TCF7L2 to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and pancreatic b-cell function. This was confirmed by measuring  the expression of PI3K p85 and p-Akt by western blotting and insulin secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments were performed to explore the genomic distribution of TCF7L2-binding sites in the promoter of PIK3R1, the affinity between which was analyzed by the luciferase reporter assay. Results: In the present study, we strikingly identified that TCF7L2 could profoundly inhibit the expression of PIK3R1 gene and its encoding protein PI3K p85, which then could lead to the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic b-cells. However, the integrity and stability of evolutionarily  conserved TCF7L2-binding motif plays a very crucial role in the binding events between transcription factor TCF7L2 and its candidate target genes. We also found that the affinity of TCF7L2 to the promoter region of PIK3R1 alters upon the specific binding sites, which further provides statistical validation to the necessity of TCF7L2-binding motif. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that TCF7L2 is closely bound to the specific binding regions of PIK3R1 promoter and prominently controls the transcription of its encoding protein p85, which further affects the activation of  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and insulin secretion.

31312259|a|Background: Some genetic association studies tried to investigate potential associations of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the results of these studies were not consistent. Thus, we performed the present meta-analysis to explore associations between TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism and T2DM in a larger pooled population. Methods: Systematic literature research of PubMed, Web of Science and Embase was performed to identify eligible studies for pooled analyses. I2 statistics were employed to assess between-study heterogeneities. If I2 was greater than 50%, random-effect models (REMs) would be used to pool the data. Otherwise, fixed-effect models (FEMs) would be applied for synthetic analyses. Results: Totally 68 studies with 115,809 subjects were included for analyses. The pooled analyses showed that TCF7L2 rs7903146 (dominant model: p   <   0.0001; recessive model: p   <   0.0001; over-dominant model: p   <   0.0001; allele model: p   <   0.0001) polymorphism was significantly associated with susceptibility to T2DM in overall population. Further subgroup analyses revealed similar significant findings in both Asians and Caucasians. Conclusions: In conclusion, our findings supported that TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing T2DM in Asians and Caucasians.

31324766|t|ZRANB3 is an African-specific type 2 diabetes locus associated with beta-cell mass and insulin response.
31324766|a|Genome analysis of diverse human populations has contributed to the identification of novel genomic loci for diseases of major clinical and public health impact. Here, we report a genome-wide analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in sub-Saharan Africans, an understudied ancestral group. We analyze ~18 million autosomal SNPs in 5,231 individuals from Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. We identify a previously-unreported genome-wide significant locus: ZRANB3 (Zinc Finger RANBP2-Type Containing 3, lead SNP p   =   2.831   *   10-9). Knockdown or genomic knockout of the zebrafish ortholog results in reduction in pancreatic b-cell number which we demonstrate to be due to increased apoptosis in islets. siRNA transfection of murine Zranb3 in MIN6 b-cells results in impaired insulin secretion in response to high glucose, implicating Zranb3 in b-cell functional response to high glucose conditions. We also show transferability in our study of 32 established T2D loci. Our findings advance understanding of the genetics of T2D in non-European ancestry populations.

31336532|t|Genetics and genomics studies in type 2 diabetes: A brief review of the current scenario in the Arab region.
31336532|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a polygenic and multi-factorial complex disease, the challenge to find genetic markers that could explain the risk of development of this disease still remains unresolved. The Arab region is one among the populations with a high prevalence of T2D and a large number of studies have been carried out in exploring the genetic factors associated with T2D risk. AIM: To summarize the recent developments in the Arab world based on the recent studies that had looked into genetic factors associated with the development of T2D in the Arab populations. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies published between 2015 and 2018 reporting genetic factors or polymorphisms associated with the risk of T2D in the Arab world. The online databases PubMed and Web of Science were used to perform the literature search. CONCLUSION: The present study has evaluated 14 studies published during the year 2015-2018. Studies from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and United Arab Emirates had been explored studying the associations of GIPR, ADIPOQ, FTO, (GRCh38.p12), MLXIP, AKNAD1, KCNJ11 CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, TCF7L2, ACE, SNAP25, ELMO1, VDR, KCTD8, GABRA4 and PRKD1 genes with T2D development.

31409726|t|The TCF7L2 Locus: A Genetic Window Into the Pathogenesis of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.
31409726|a|Over the past    15 years there has been great progress in our understanding of the genetics of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. This has been driven principally by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in increasingly larger sample sizes, where many distinct loci have now been reported for both traits. One of the loci that dominates these studies is the TCF7L2 locus for type 2 diabetes. This genetic signal has been leveraged to explore multiple aspects of disease risk, including developments in genetic risk scores, genetic commonalities with cancer, and for gaining insights into diabetes-related molecular pathways. Furthermore, the TCF7L2 locus has aided in providing insights into the genetics of both latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and various presentations of type 1 diabetes. This review outlines the knowledge gained to date and highlights how work with this locus leads the way in guiding how many other genetic loci could be similarly used to gain insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes.

31420409|t|Glucolipotoxicity Alters Insulin Secretion via Epigenetic Changes in Human Islets.
31420409|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion and elevated glucose levels, often in combination with high levels of circulating fatty acids. Long-term exposure to glucose or fatty acids impair insulin secretion in pancreatic islets and this may partly be due to epigenetic alterations. We aimed to study effects of combined high concentrations of glucose and palmitate for 48h (glucolipotoxicity) on the transcriptome, epigenome and cell function in human islets. Glucolipotoxic exposure impaired insulin secretion, increased apoptosis and significantly (FDR<5%) altered expression of 1,855 genes. These include 35 genes previously implicated in T2D by GWAS e.g. TCF7L2 and CDKN2B. Additionally, metabolic pathways were enriched for down-regulated genes. Of the differentially expressed genes, 1,469 also exhibited altered DNA methylation, e.g. CDK1, FICD, TPX2 and TYMS Luciferase assay showed that increased methylation of CDK1 directly reduces its transcription in pancreatic beta-cells, supporting that DNA methylation underlies altered expression after glucolipotoxicity. Follow-up experiments in clonal beta-cells showed that knockdown of FICD and TPX2 alters insulin secretion. Together, our novel data demonstrate that glucolipotoxicity changes the epigenome in human islets thereby altering gene expression and possibly exacerbating the secretory defect in T2D.

31478326|t|Gene-lifestyle interaction on risk of type 2 diabetes: A systematic review.
31478326|a|The pathophysiological influence of gene-lifestyle interactions on the risk to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) is currently under intensive research. This systematic review summarizes the evidence for gene-lifestyle interactions regarding T2D incidence. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched until 31 January 2019 to identify publication with (a) prospective study design; (b) T2D incidence; (c) gene-diet, gene-physical activity, and gene-weight loss intervention interaction; and (d) population who are healthy or prediabetic. Of 66 eligible publications, 28 reported significant interactions. A variety of different genetic variants and dietary factors were studied. Variants at TCF7L2 were most frequently investigated and showed interactions with fiber and whole grain on T2D incidence. Further gene-diet interactions were reported for, eg, a western dietary pattern with a T2D-GRS, fat and carbohydrate with IRS1 rs2943641, and heme iron with variants of HFE. Physical activity showed interaction with HNF1B, IRS1, PPARy, ADRA2B, SLC2A2, and ABCC8 variants and weight loss interventions with ENPP1, PPARy, ADIPOR2, ADRA2B, TNFa, and LIPC variants. However, most findings represent single study findings obtained in European ethnicities. Although some interactions have been reported, their conclusiveness is still low, as most findings were not yet replicated across multiple study populations.

31492908|t|Serotonin is elevated in risk-genotype carriers of TCF7L2 - rs7903146.
31492908|a|The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) polymorphism rs7903146 is known to be tightly associated with an elevated risk for type 2 diabetes, whereas the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We evaluated the metabolic profile of a total of 394 patients' serum samples with respect to their rs7903146 genotype using targeted metabolomics in a discovery (n   =   154) and a validation (n   =   240) study. We have identified serotonin as the top metabolite being increased in carriers of the risk allele. Serotonin was significantly associated with the rs7903146 genotype after full adjustment including type 2 diabetes and further top ranked metabolites. Given the role of peripheral serotonin in metabolic homeostasis and type 2 diabetes, this finding provides a first hint that the well-known impact of the TCF7L2 polymorphism on type 2 diabetes risk may involve a serotonin-dependent pathway.

31500828|t|The dynamic methylome of islets in health and disease.
31500828|a|BACKGROUND: Epigenetic processes control timing and level of gene expression throughout life, during development, differentiation, and aging, and are the link to adapting gene expression profiles to environmental cues. To qualify for the definition of 'epigenetic', a change to a gene's activity must be inherited through at least one mitotic division. Epigenetic mechanisms link changes in the environment to adaptions of the genome that do not rely on changes in the DNA sequence. In the past two decades, multiple studies have aimed to identify epigenetic mechanisms, and to define their role in development, differentiation and disease. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we will focus on the current knowledge of the epigenetic control of pancreatic beta cell maturation and dysfunction and its relationship to the development of islet cell failure in diabetes. Most of the data currently available have been obtained in mice, but we will summarize studies of human data as well. We will focus here on DNA methylation, as this is the most stable epigenetic mark, and least impacted by the variables inherent in islet procurement, isolation, and culture. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation patterns of beta cell are dynamic during maturation and during the diabetic process. In both cases, the changes occur at cell specific regulatory regions such as enhancers, where the methylation profile is cell type specific. Frequently, the differentially methylated regulatory elements are associated with key function genes such as PDX1, NKX6-1 and TCF7L2. During maturation, enhancers tend to become demethylated in association with increased activation of beta cell function genes and increased functionality, as indicated by glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Likewise, the changes to the DNA methylome that are present in pancreatic islets from diabetic donors are enriched in regulatory regions as well.

31504696|t|Mediterranean Diet Adherence Modulates Anthropometric Measures by TCF7L2 Genotypes among Puerto Rican Adults.
31504696|a|BACKGROUND: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) genetic variants that predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes (T2D) show inconsistent associations with anthropometric traits. Interaction between TCF7L2 genotypes and dietary factors may help explain these observations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential modulation of TCF7L2-rs7903146 and rs12255372 on anthropometric markers by a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 1120 participants (aged 45-75 y) of the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study. Anthropometric variables were measured, and polymorphisms were genotyped using standardized protocols. Diet was assessed using a validated FFQ. The MedDiet was defined based on adherence to 9 food and nutrient components using sex-specific population-based median cut-offs; high adherence was defined as meeting     4 components. Haplotypes were tested for association with obesity traits, independently and via interaction with the MedDiet. RESULTS: TCF7L2-rs7903146 showed significant interaction with the MedDiet influencing BMI, weight, and waist circumference. The T risk-allele carriers (CT  +  TT) with a high MedDiet score had lower weight (77.3      1.0 compared with CC 80.9      1.0 kg; P  =  0.013) and waist circumference (99.2      0.9 compared with CC 102.2      0.9 cm; P  =  0.021), when compared with CC participants. A low MedDiet score resulted in no significant differences between genotypes. For TCF7L2-rs12255372, we found significant interactions with the MedDiet for weight (P-interaction  =  0.034) and BMI (P-interaction  =  0.036). The T allele carriers with a higher MedDiet score showed a trend of lower but no significant differences when compared with CC participants for BMI (P  =  0.19), weight (P  =  0.09), and waist circumference (P  =  0.11). We found significant interactions between the 2 risk-carrying haplotypes and the MedDiet compared with the common haplotype (GC), with lower BMI (        SE, TT: -1.53      0.68; P-interaction  =  0.024), weight (TT: -4.16      1.77; P-interaction  =  0.019), and waist circumference (GT: -5.07      2.50; P-interaction  =  0.042) at a high MedDiet score. CONCLUSION: Puerto Ricans with the TCF7L2-rs7903146 and rs12255372 T2D risk genotypes, although still high, had better anthropometric profiles when adhering to a MedDiet, suggesting that this diet may offset unfavorable genetic predisposition.

31517619|t|Lack of association between TCF7L2 gene variants and type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Brazilian sample of patients with the risk for cardiovascular disease.
31517619|a|OBJECTIVE: Genetic variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene have been described as the most noteworthy ones regarding the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) liability. This work is aimed to evaluate the association between rs12255372 and rs7903146 polymorphisms and T2DM in patients with cardiovascular disease (CAD) risk. METHODS: A sample of six hundred and forty-seven patients that underwent the coronary angiography in a Cardiac Catheterization Lab was evaluated. The patients were investigated for the presence of T2DM and coronary stenosis. The TCF7L2 polymorphisms were genotyped by real-time PCR and the haplotype analysis was performed with the MLOCUS software. All genetic tests were carried out by considering the haplotype combinations in patients divided into three groups: 0 - carrying none disease risk allele, 1 - carrying one or two risk alleles and 2 - carrying three or four risk alleles. RESULTS: No significant associations between TCF7L2 risk haplotypes and the presence of T2DM or CAD were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the TCF7L2 rs12255372 and rs7903146 polymorphisms do not influence T2DM in Brazilian patients with the high risk for CAD. Therefore, we assume that these variants may only be relevant for a specific subgroup of T2DM patients or some particular human population.

31546272|t|Clinical Impact of the TCF7L2 Gene rs7903146 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk Polymorphism in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Impaired Glycemic Control and Increased Need of Insulin Therapy.
31546272|a|BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphism in TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus. Mechanisms by which this mutation acts, and its impact on the clinical course of the diseases remain unclear. Here we investigated the clinical impact of the T risk allele in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We genotyped the C/T polymorphism in 164 Caucasian women with GDM (German n=114; Greek n=50). The impact of the T allele on the results of the 75g oral-glucose-tolerance-test, and on the required therapy (diet/lifestyle or insulin) was investigated. RESULTS: During oral-glucose-tolerance-test, women harboring the T allele displayed significantly higher glucose values at 60 min (p=0.034) and were more likely to require insulin therapy even after adjusting for confounders, such as BMI and age. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that the T risk allele in TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with failure in early postprandial glycemic control and requirement of insulin therapy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, even after adjusting for confounding factors such BMI and age.

31619783|t|Brain-to-pancreas signalling axis links nicotine and diabetes.

31619789|t|Habenular TCF7L2 links nicotine addiction to diabetes.
31619789|a|Diabetes is far more prevalent in smokers than non-smokers, but the underlying mechanisms of vulnerability are unknown. Here we show that the diabetes-associated gene Tcf7l2 is densely expressed in the medial habenula (mHb) region of the rodent brain, where it regulates the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inhibition of TCF7L2 signalling in the mHb increases nicotine intake in mice and rats. Nicotine increases levels of blood glucose by TCF7L2-dependent stimulation of the mHb. Virus-tracing experiments identify a polysynaptic connection from the mHb to the pancreas, and wild-type rats with a history of nicotine consumption show increased circulating levels of glucagon and insulin, and diabetes-like dysregulation of blood glucose homeostasis. By contrast, mutant Tcf7l2 rats are resistant to these actions of nicotine. Our findings suggest that TCF7L2 regulates the stimulatory actions of nicotine on a habenula-pancreas axis that links the addictive properties of nicotine to its diabetes-promoting actions.

31676834|t|TCF7L2 polymorphisms are associated with amygdalar volume in elderly individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.
31676834|a|The association between several Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) as well as additional  T2D-related traits is well established. Since alteration in total and regional brain volumes are consistent findings among T2D individuals, we studied the association of four T2D susceptibility SNPS within TCF7L2 (rs7901695, rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs12255372) with volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), gray matter, and regional volumes of amygdala and hippocampus obtained from structural MRI among 191 T2D elderly Jewish individuals. Under recessive genetic model (controlling for age, sex and intracranial volume), we found that for all four SNPs, carriers of two copies of the T2D risk allele (homozygous genotype) had significantly smaller amygdalar volume: rs7901695- CC genotype vs. CT   +   TT genotypes, p   =   0.002; rs7903146-TT vs. TC   +   CC, p   =   0.003; rs11196205- CC vs. CG   +   GG, p   =   0.0003; and rs12255372- TT vs. TG   +   GG, p   =   0.003. Adjusting also for T2D-related covariates, body mass index (BMI), and ancestry did not change the results substantively (rs7901695, p   =   0.003; rs7903146, p   =   0.005; rs11196205, p   =   0.001; and rs12255372, p   =   0.005). Conditional analysis demonstrated that only rs11196205 was independently associated with amygdalar volume at a significant level. Separate analysis of left and right amygdala revealed stronger results for left amygdalar volume. Taken together, we report association of TCF7L2 SNPs  with amygdalar volume among T2D elderly Jewish patients. Further studies in other populations are required to support these findings and reach more  definitive conclusions.

31681547|t|Evaluation of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 and ATP2B1 Genes as Cardiovascular Risk Predictors in Chronic Kidney Disease.
31681547|a|Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and premature mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The transcription factor 7-like 2 (<i>TCF7L2</i>) gene product TCF4 is a transcription factor that acts as a downstream effector in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and may be important in the development of both type 2 diabetes and renal development and disease. It is, therefore, plausible that mutations in this gene could manifest themselves in reduced kidney function or kidney disease through their effects on hyperglycemia as well as independent of this mechanism. The <i>ATP2B1</i> gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium ATPase isoform 1, which removes bivalent calcium ions from eukaryotic cells against very large concentration gradients and is responsible for controlling the contraction and dilation of vascular smooth muscles. Aim and Objectives: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TCF7L2 gene as cardiovascular risk predictors in CKD and (2) to evaluate SNPs of ATP2B1 gene as cardiovascular risk predictors in CKD. Subjects and Methods: Fifty clinically diagnosed CKD patients in the age group between 20 and 60 years of both genders were selected as cases and fifty healthy participants from the master health checkup department were selected as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted based on the spin column kit method. The DNA samples were stored at -20  C until analysis. Genotyping for TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 (C/T) and ATP2B1 gene rs11105354 (A/G) was carried out through polymerase chain reaction. Results: T allele frequency was observed in 12 controls and 23 cases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-4.7). CC genotype was observed in 38 controls and 27 cases and CT genotype in 22 cases and 12 controls. A allele was found in 38 cases and 23 controls (OR = 2, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8). The mean values of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, urea, and creatinine were high in cases when compared to controls. Conclusion: T allele of TCF7L2 gene rs7903146 (C/T) and A allele of ATP2B1 (A/G) gene rs11105354 (A/G) are associated with CVD in CKD patients.

31691451|t|Association between allelic variants in the glucagon-like peptide 1 and cholecystokinin receptor genes with gastric emptying and glucose tolerance.
31691451|a|BACKGROUND: Nutrient-mediated release of cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) regulates gastric emptying (GE) via duodenogastric feedback mechanisms; GLP-1 also regulates postprandial insulin secretion. Some patients with functional upper gastrointestinal symptoms have impaired glucose tolerance during enteral dextrose infusion. Our hypothesis was that variants in CCK, GLP-1, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2 locus), which is associated with greatest genetic risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with GE and independently with glucose tolerance. Our aims were to evaluate the associations between these GE, glucose tolerance, and these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). METHODS: Genetic variants, scintigraphic GE of solids, plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 during enteral dextrose infusion (75gm over 2  hours) were measured. GE and enteral dextrose infusion were, respectively, evaluated in 44 (27 controls and 17 patients with functional dyspepsia or nausea) and 42 (28 controls, 14 patients) participants; of these, 51 participants consented to assessment of SNPs. Four functional SNPs were studied: rs6923761 and rs1042044 at GLP-1 receptor, rs7903146 (TCF7L2), and rs1800857 (CCK receptor). KEY RESULTS: Gastric emptying was normal in 38, rapid in 4, and delayed in two participants; 38 had normal, and four had impaired glucose tolerance. The T allele at rs7903146 (TCF7L2) was non-significantly associated (P  =  .14) with faster GE. The associations between SNPs and demographic variables, GE t<sub>half</sub> , glucose tolerance and plasma GLP1 levels were not significant. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: There is a trend toward an association between faster GE and the diabetes-associated allele at rs7903146 in TCF7L2. However, these SNPs were not associated with plasma glucose or GLP1 concentrations during enteral dextrose infusion.

31697830|t|Genetic modifiers of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes have extensive overlap with type 2 diabetes and related traits.
31697830|a|CONTEXT: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop a distinct form of diabetes characterized by   -cell dysfunction and islet amyloid accumulation similar to type 2 diabetes (T2D) but generally normal insulin sensitivity. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) risk is determined by both CFTR, the gene responsible for CF, and other genetic variants. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic modifiers of CFRD and determine the genetic overlap with other types of diabetes. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A genome-wide association study was conducted for CFRD onset on 5740 individuals with CF. Weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for T1D, T2D and diabetes endophenotypes were tested for association with CFRD. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance was obtained for variants at a novel locus (PTMA) and two known CFRD genetic modifiers (TCF7L2 and SLC26A9). PTMA and SLC26A9 variants were CF-specific; TCF7L2 variants also associated with T2D. CFRD was strongly associated with PRSs for T2D, insulin secretion, post-challenge glucose concentration and fasting plasma glucose, and less strongly with T1D PRSs. CFRD was inconsistently associated with PRSs for insulin sensitivity and was not associated with a PRS for islet autoimmunity. A CFRD PRS comprised of variants selected from these PRSs (with FDR p-value<0.1) and the genome-wide significant variants was associated with CFRD in a replication population. CONCLUSIONS: CFRD and T2D have more etiologic and mechanistic overlap than previously known, aligning along pathways involving   -cell function rather than insulin sensitivity. Two CFRD risk loci are unrelated to T2D and may affect multiple aspects of CF. An 18-variant PRS stratifies risk of CFRD in an independent population.

31719833|t|Subcutaneous fat mass is associated with genetic risk scores related to proinflammatory cytokine signaling and interact with physical activity in middle-aged obese adults.
31719833|a|Background and aims: Subcutaneous fat mass is negatively correlated with atherogenic risk factors, but its putative benefits remain controversial. We hypothesized that genetic variants that influence subcutaneous fat mass would modulate lipid and glucose metabolism and have interactions with lifestyles in Korean middle-aged adults with high visceral fat. Materials and methods: Subcutaneous fat mass was categorized by dividing the average of subscapular skin-fold thickness by BMI and its cutoff point was 1.2. Waist circumferences were used for representing visceral fat mass with Asian cutoff points. GWAS of subjects aged 40-65   years with high visceral fat (<i>n</i>   =   3303) were conducted and the best gene-gene interactions from the genetic variants related to subcutaneous fat were selected and explored using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated by weighted GRS that was divided into low, medium and high groups. Results: Subjects with high subcutaneous fat did not have dyslipidemia compared with those with low subcutaneous fat, although both subject groups had similar amounts of total fat. The best model to influence subcutaneous fat included <i>IL17A</i>_rs4711998, <i>ADCY2_</i>rs326149, <i>ESRRG_</i>rs4846514, <i>CYFIP2_</i>rs733730, <i>TCF7L2_</i>rs7917983, <i>ZNF766_</i>rs41497444 and <i>TGFBR3</i>_rs7526590. The odds ratio (OR) for increasing subcutaneous fat was higher by 2.232 folds in the high-GRS group, after adjusting for covariates. However, total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride and C-reactive protein concentrations in the circulation were not associated with GRS. Subjects with high-GRS had higher serum HDL cholesterol levels than those with low-GRS. Physical activity and GRS had an interaction with subcutaneous fat. In subjects with low physical activity, the odds ratio for high subcutaneous fat increased by 2.232, but subcutaneous fat deposition was not affected in the high-GRS group with high physical activity. Conclusion: Obese adults with high-GRS had more subcutaneous fat, but they did not show more dyslipidemia and inflammation compared to low-GRS. High physical activity prevented subcutaneous fat deposition in subjects with high GRS for subcutaneous fat.

31759989|t|Maya gene variants related to the risk of type 2 diabetes in a family-based association study.
31759989|a|Mexican Maya populations have a notably high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a consequence of the interaction between environmental factors and a genetic component. To assess the impact of 24 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) located in 18 T2D risk genes, we conducted a family-based association evaluation in samples from Maya communities with a high incidence of the disease. A total of four hundred individuals were recruited from three Maya communities with a high T2D incidence. Family pedigrees (100) and 49 nuclear families were included. Genotyping was performed by allelic discrimination with TaqMan probes. This study also included the family-based association test (FBAT) statistic U to assess the genetic associations with T2D, and the multivariate statistical and haplotype analyses. A positive association with TD2 risk was found for WFS1 rs6446482 (p  =  0.046, Z  =  1.994) under an additive model, and SIRT1 rs7896005 (p  =  0.038, Z  =  2.073) under the dominant model. Multivariate model analysis, including T2D status, age, and body mass index (BMI), displayed significant covariance in PPARGC-1a rs8192678; SIRT1 rs7896005; TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs122243326; UCP3 rs3781907; and HHEX rs1111875 with a P  <  0.05. This study revealed an association of SIRT1 and WFS1 with T2D risk.

31768379|t|Role of TCF7L2 and PPARG2 Gene Polymorphisms in Renal and Cardiovascular Complications among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Cohort Study.
31768379|a|Background: The emerging renal and cardiovascular complications of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) genetics involves differently assembled gene variants including transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARG2) polymorphisms. However, the relevance of these genes for complication prediction has not been extensively tested. Methods: We analyzed the SNP rs7903146 variants in TCF7L2 and PPARG2 gene polymorphisms for their contribution to the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular complications in a prospective cohort study. All T2DM patients were followed up to estimate the glomerular filtration rate and cardiovascular outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the genotype effect on the incidence of CKD and vascular complications. Results: A total of 422 patients were included. SNP rs7903146 variants in the TCF7L2 gene were classified into 3 groups: CC, 385 patients (91.2%), CT, 32 patients (7.6%), and TT, 5 patients (1.2%), while in the PPARG2 gene they were classified into 2 groups: Pro12Pro, 404 patients (95.7%) and Pro12Ala, 18 patients (4.3%). The prevalence of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and death at the end of the 5-year follow-up was 16.8, 29, and 7.9%, respectively. The Pro12Ala variant of the PPARG2 gene was significantly associated with increased CKD risk at the end of the study (adjusted HR 3.45, 95% CI 1.01-11.77, <i>p</i> = 0.046); it showed a significant association with increased cerebrovascular risk, but not cardiovascular disease and mortality. No genotype effect of rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene was apparent on renal and cardiovascular complications, except the TT variant of rs7903146 increased cardiovascular events when compared with the non-TT variant. Conclusion: The findings of our study were that the Pro12Ala variant in the PPARG2 gene was associated with risk of developing CKD and cerebrovascular disease in Asian T2DM subjects in a prospective cohort study. The TCF7L2 polymorphism was not associated with cardiovascular outcomes.

31775533|t|Genetic variation in <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 correlating with peripheral arterial disease in long-standing type 2 diabetes.
31775533|a|AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (<i>TCF7L2</i>) rs7903146 polymorphism and peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In total, 1818 Korean type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled from January 2013 to December 2017. Subjects were categorized into two groups according to their duration of type 2 diabetes: long (   10   years, <i>n</i>   =   771) and short (<10   years, <i>n</i>   =   1047) durations. A multivariate logistic regression model was used for assuming an additive effect on peripheral arterial disease for the presence of a variant allele in <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146. RESULTS: The frequency of the minor T-allele was 7.6% (<i>n</i>   =   139), and this allele was significantly associated with a 2.6-fold higher risk of peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio   =   2.595, 95% confidence interval   =   1.177-5.722, <i>p</i>   =   0.018) in patients exhibiting a long duration of type 2 diabetes (   10   years). This result was significant after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, familial history of diabetes, smoking, duration of diabetes and laboratory measurements, which included glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose and lipid profiles. In patients with diabetes   <   10   years, there was no significant association between <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 and peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio   =   1.233, 95% confidence interval   =   0.492-3.093, <i>p</i>   =   0.655). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that genetic variation in <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 could increase risk for peripheral arterial disease in patients exhibiting long-standing type 2 diabetes.

31803598|t|Carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146, rs12255372 Risk Alleles in the South Tamil Nadu T2DM Patients Present with Early Incidence and Insulin Dependence.
31803598|a|Background and Aims: Metabolic abnormalities in T2DM (Type 2 diabetes mellitus) include classic manifestations such as impaired insulin secretion, synthesis and peripheral insulin resistance. The intronic variants rs7903146 and rs12255372 of the TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) gene are strongly associated with risk of incidence of T2DM and impaired b-cell functions. Studies addressing the early T2DM onset, and early insulin dependence in T2DM patients of south Tamil Nadu are still lacking, and hence the present study focuses in determining the influence of the TCF7L2 polymorphisms in the incidence and disease course in the T2DM patients of south Tamil Nadu. Methods: Anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters were carried out in early onset (Group A), early onset insulin dependent T2DM patients (Group B) and non-insulin dependent T2DM patients (Group C). PCR, allele specific PCR (ASP), PCR product sequencing strategies were utilized to determine the genotype and the impact of the TCF7L2 SNPs in the T2DM disease course. Results: Female T2DM patients with the CT/TT rs7903146 genotype (<i>P</i> = 0.005) and the rs12255372 GT/TT genotype (<i>P</i> = 0.036) exhibited a significantly low mean age for T2DM incidence. Correlation/regression analysis in the T2DM patients revealed that rs12255372 (<i>P</i> = 0.042) is associated with early onset in the Group C patients and the rs7903146 (<i>P</i> = 0.018), rs12255372 (<i>P</i> = 0.026) are associated with insulin dependence in the group B patients. Conclusion: Screening for the TCF7L2 polymorphisms will prevent T2DM incidence and enable life style changes, appropriate therapeutic strategies that would help combat the accelerated disease course in the T2DM patients.

31805307|t|The TCF7L2-dependent high-voltage activated calcium channel subunit a2  -1 controls calcium signaling in rodent pancreatic beta-cells.
31805307|a|The transcription factor TCF7L2 remains the most important diabetes gene identified to date and genetic risk carriers exhibit lower insulin secretion. We show that Tcf7l2 regulates the auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Cacna2d1 gene/a2  -1 protein levels. Furthermore, suppression of a2  -1 decreased voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and high glucose/depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling which mimicked the effect of silencing of Tcf7l2. This appears to be the result of impaired voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel trafficking to the plasma membrane, as Cav1.2 channels accumulated in the recycling endosomes after a2  -1 suppression, in clonal as well as primary rodent beta-cells. This impaired the capacity for glucose-induced insulin secretion in Cacna2d1-silenced cells. Overexpression of a2  -1 increased high-glucose/K<sup>+</sup>-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, overexpression of a2  -1 in Tcf7l2-silenced cells rescued the Tcf7l2-dependent impairment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, but not the reduced insulin secretion. Taken together, these data clarify the connection between Tcf7l2, a2  -1 in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent insulin secretion.

31818149|t|Role of rs7903146 polymorphism and adropin serum level in patients with diabetes mellitus; a case-control study from Isfahan, Iran.
31818149|a|<b>Background:</b> Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the common endocrinopathy which characterised by insulin resistance, insufficient expression or secretion of insulin and decrement of insulin effectiveness. Although T2DM has unknown aetiology, the strongest susceptible gene in this disease is TCF7L2. Adropin peptide may have roles in T2DM pathogenesis due to several roles in glucose tolerance, decrement of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and energy homoeostasis.<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the serum level of adropin in T2DM patients and comparing with healthy individuals as well as assessing frequency of rs7903146 genotypes/alleles in patients and control groups.<b>Methods:</b> We analysed the frequency of rs7903146 genotypes/alleles in 93 patients with T2DM disease and 53 healthy individuals by the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The serum level of adropin was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.<b>Results:</b> The mean serum level of adropin was 12.32        2.98 and 9.51        2.73 in patients and control groups, respectively (<i>p</i> value   <   .001). Also, there were significant difference in frequency of genotypes and alleles of rs7903146 in patients and controls groups (<i>p</i>   <   .001). The rs7903146T/T and rs7903146C/T genotypes increased risk of T2DM disease (OR: 6.035 and OR: 3.082, respectively). Interestingly, the highest level of adropin was detected in T2DMpatients with rs7903146T/T genotype.<b>Conclusion:</b> Our analysis showed higher level of adropin in T2DM patients and increased risk of T2DM with rs7903146T/T and rs7903146C/T genotypes.

31829936|t|Developmentally regulated <i>Tcf7l2</i> splice variants mediate transcriptional repressor functions during eye formation.
31829936|a|Tcf7l2 mediates Wnt/b-Catenin signalling during development and is implicated in cancer and type-2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 and Wnt/b-Catenin signalling elicit such a diversity of biological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we study the function of zebrafish <i>tcf7l2</i>alternative splice variants and show that only variants that include exon five or an analogous human <i>tcf7l2</i> variant can effectively provide compensatory repressor function to restore eye formation in embryos lacking <i>tcf7l1a/tcf7l1b</i> function. Knockdown of exon five specific <i>tcf7l2</i> variants in <i>tcf7l1a</i> mutants also compromises eye formation, and these variants can effectively repress Wnt pathway activity in reporter assays using Wnt target gene promoters. We show that the repressive activities of exon5-coded variants are likely explained by their interaction with Tle co-repressors. Furthermore, phosphorylated residues in Tcf7l2 coded exon5 facilitate repressor activity. Our studies suggest that developmentally regulated splicing of <i>tcf7l2</i> can influence the transcriptional output of the Wnt pathway.

31859960|t|[Association of the TCF7L2 (RS7903146) genotype with adiposity and metabolic markers in the Chilean adult population].
31859960|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes etiology has a strong genetic component. More than 20 genetic variants have been associated with diabetes and other metabolic markers. However, the polymorphism rs7903146 of the TCF7L2 gene has shown the strongest association. AIM: To investigate the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) genotype with adiposity and metabolic markers in the Chilean adult population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The association of TCF7L2 (rs7093146) with adiposity and metabolic markers was studied in 301 participants. The outcomes of the study were adiposity markers (body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass and waist circumference) and metabolic markers (blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, lipid profile, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and leptin). RESULTS: There was an association between the polymorphism TCF7L2 genotype and fasting blood glucose. The latter increased by 4.86 mg/dl per each copy of the risk allele [(95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.48; 9.24), p = 0.03] in the unadjusted adjusted model. However, this association was slightly attenuated in the fully adjusted model [4.38 mg/dl (95% IC: 0.16; 8.60), p = 0.04)]. There were no associations between the TCF7L2 genotype and any other metabolic or adiposity outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the association between the TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and fasting glucose in the Chilean population. However, further studies are needed to confirm the association between the TCF7L2 and diabetes risk in the Chilean population.

31948755|t|Computational and functional analyses of T2D GWAS SNPs for transcription factor binding.
31948755|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified numerous non-coding genetic variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the functional roles underlying these non-coding variants remain largely unknown. The effects of T2D GWAS lead SNPs on transcriptional factors binding motifs were firstly analyzed via JASPAR, followed by functional validations including dual-luciferase reporter assays, biotin-based DNA pull-down assays, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blotting. The results showed that GWAS SNP rs4430796 conferred T allele specific transcriptional enhancer activity via a PAX6 binding element, and upregulated the expression of HNF1B. GWAS SNP rs4607103 showed a bidirectional modulation of ADAMTS9-AS2 and ADAMTS9 by TCF7L2 in a T allele-specific manner. GWAS SNP rs849135 conferred C allele-specific bidirectional transcriptional enhancer activity via a CREB1 binding element. Our findings have uncovered the functional mechanisms of three T2D GWAS SNPs via affecting the binding of transcription factors, providing new insights into the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of T2D.

31972003|t|Metabolic and Genetic Determinants of Glucose Shape After Oral Challenge in Obese Youths: A Longitudinal Study.
31972003|a|CONTEXT: The time-to-glucose-peak following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a highly reproducible marker for diabetes risk. In obese youths, we lack evidence for the mechanisms underlying the effects of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant on glucose peak. METHODS: We analyzed the metabolic phenotype and the genotype for the TCF7L2 rs7903146 in 630 obese youths with normal (NGT) and impaired (IGT) glucose tolerance. Participants underwent a 3-hour, 9-point OGTT to estimate, using the oral minimal model, the disposition index (DI), the static (  static) and dynamic (  dynamic) components b-cell responsiveness and insulin sensitivity (SI). In a subgroup (n = 241) longitudinally followed for 2 years, we estimated the effect of time-to-glucose-peak on glucose tolerance change. RESULTS: Participants were grouped into early (<30 minutes) and late (>= 30 minutes) glucose peakers. A delayed glucose peak was featured by a decline in   static (P < .001) in the absence of a difference in   dynamic. The prevalence of T-risk allele for TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant significantly increased in the late peak group. A lower DI was correlated with higher glucose concentration at 1 and 2 hours, whereas SI was inversely associated with 1-hour glucose. Glucose peak <30 minutes was protective toward worsening of glucose tolerance overtime (odds ratio 0.35 [0.15-0.82]; P = .015), with no subjects progressing to NGT or persisting IGT, in contrast to the 40% of progressor in those with late glucose peak. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of T-risk allele for the TCF7L2 rs7903146 prevailed in the late time-to-glucose peak group, which in turn is associated with impaired b-cell responsiveness to glucose (  ), thereby predisposing to prediabetes and diabetes in obese youths.
