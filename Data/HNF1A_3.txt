19564454|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young in children with incidental hyperglycemia: a multicenter Italian study of 172 families.
19564454|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in Italian children with incidental hyperglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 748 subjects age 1-18 years with incidental hyperglycemia, minimal diagnostic criteria for MODY were met by 172 families. Mutational analyses of the glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) genes were performed. RESULTS: We identified 85 GCK gene mutations in 109 probands and 10 HNF1A mutations in 12 probands. In GCK patients, the median neonatal weight and age at the first evaluation were lower than those found in patients with HNF1A mutations. Median fasting plasma glucose and impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance frequency after oral glucose tolerance testing were higher in GCK patients, who also showed a lower frequency of diabetes than HNF1A patients. CONCLUSIONS: GCK mutations are the prevailing cause of MODY (63.4%) when the index case is recruited in Italian children with incidental hyperglycemia.

19565026|t|Investigating maturity onset diabetes of the young.
19565026|a|Maturity Onset Diabetes of Young (MODY) is a monogenic and autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus with onset of the disease often before 25 years of age. It is due to dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells characterised by non-ketotic diabetes and absence of pancreatic auto-antibodies. It is frequently mistaken for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis of MODY is important as the GCK subtype has better prognosis and may not require any treatment. Subtypes HNF1A and HNF4A are sensitive to sulfonylureas, however diabetes complications are common if not treated early. Moreover, there is genetic implication for the patient and family. Rare MODY subtypes can be associated with pancreatic and renal anomalies as well as exocrine dysfunction of the pancreas. So far there are six widely accepted subtypes of MODY described but the list has grown to nine. Although the majority of diabetes mellitus in youth remains type 1 and the incidence of type 2 is rising, MODY should be considered in patients with non-ketotic diabetes at presentation, and in patients with a strong family history of diabetes mellitus without pancreatic auto-antibodies. Furthermore the diagnosis must be confirmed by molecular studies. With advancement in genomic technology, rapid screening for MODY mutations will become readily available in the future.

19646184|t|Phenotypical aspects of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY diabetes) in comparison with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents: experience from a large multicentre database.
19646184|a|AIMS: To analyse and compare clinical characteristics in young patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: We conducted an observational investigation using the DPV-Wiss database containing clinical data on 40 757 diabetic patients &lt; 20 years of age from Germany and Austria. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-nine cases were clinically categorized as MODY (0.83%); 562 patients were diagnosed as T2DM (1.4%). In 20% of cases, the diagnosis of MODY was based on clinical findings only. Of the 272 subjects where genetic testing was available, 3% did not carry mutations in the three examined MODY genes. Glucokinase-MODY was commoner than HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY. Age at diagnosis was younger in MODY patients. The body mass index of T2DM was significantly higher compared with all MODY subgroups. Macrovascular risk factors such as dyslipidaemia and hypertension were commoner in T2DM, but 23% of MODY patients had dyslipidaemia and 10% hypertension. Glycaemic control was within the therapeutic target (HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5%) in 86% of MODY and 70% of T2DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MODY in children and adolescents in Germany and Austria is lower than that of T2DM in this age group. Dyslipidaemia and hypertension are less frequent in MODY compared with T2DM patients, but do occur.

19672314|t|Low frequency variants in the exons only encoding isoform A of HNF1A do not contribute to susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
19672314|a|BACKGROUND: There is considerable interest in the hypothesis that low frequency, intermediate penetrance variants contribute to the proportion of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) susceptibility not attributable to the common variants uncovered through genome-wide association approaches. Genes previously implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes are obvious candidates in this respect. In this study, we focussed on exons 8-10 of the HNF1A gene since rare, penetrant mutations in these exons (which are only transcribed in selected HNF1A isoforms) are associated with a later age of diagnosis of Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) than mutations in exons 1-7. The age of diagnosis in the subgroup of HNF1A-MODY individuals with exon 8-10 mutations overlaps with that of early multifactorial T2D, and we set out to test the hypothesis that these exons might also harbour low-frequency coding variants of intermediate penetrance that contribute to risk of multifactorial T2D. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed targeted capillary resequencing of HNF1A exons 8-10 in 591 European T2D subjects enriched for genetic aetiology on the basis of an early age of diagnosis (&lt; or =45 years) and/or family history of T2D (&gt; or =1 affected sibling). PCR products were sequenced and compared to the published HNF1A sequence. We identified several variants (rs735396 [IVS9-24T&gt;C], rs1169304 [IVS8+29T&gt;C], c.1768+44C&gt;T [IVS9+44C&gt;T] and rs61953349 [c.1545G&gt;A, p.T515T] but no novel non-synonymous coding variants were detected. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that low frequency, nonsynonymous coding variants in the terminal exons of HNF1A are unlikely to contribute to T2D-susceptibility in European samples. Nevertheless, the rationale for seeking low-frequency causal variants in genes known to contain rare, penetrant mutations remains strong and should motivate efforts to screen other genes in a similar fashion.

19794065|t|Polygenic risk variants for type 2 diabetes susceptibility modify age at diagnosis in monogenic HNF1A diabetes.
19794065|a|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the HNF1A gene are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). There is a substantial variation in the age at diabetes diagnosis, even within families where diabetes is caused by the same mutation. We investigated the hypothesis that common polygenic variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes might account for the difference in age at diagnosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen robustly associated type 2 diabetes variants were successfully genotyped in 410 individuals from 203 HNF1A-MODY families, from two study centers in the U.K. and Norway. We assessed their effect on the age at diagnosis both individually and in a combined genetic score by summing the number of type 2 diabetes risk alleles carried by each patient. RESULTS: We confirmed the effects of environmental and genetic factors known to modify the age at HNF1A-MODY diagnosis, namely intrauterine hyperglycemia (-5.1 years if present, P = 1.6 x 10(-10)) and HNF1A mutation position (-5.2 years if at least two isoforms affected, P = 1.8 x 10(-2)). Additionally, our data showed strong effects of sex (females diagnosed 3.0 years earlier, P = 6.0 x 10(-4)) and age at study (0.3 years later diagnosis per year increase in age, P = 4.7 x 10(-38)). There were no strong individual single nucleotide polymorphism effects; however, in the combined genetic score model, each additional risk allele was associated with 0.35 years earlier diabetes diagnosis (P = 5.1 x 10(-3)). CONCLUSIONS: We show that type 2 diabetes risk variants of modest effect sizes reduce the age at diagnosis in HNF1A-MODY. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate that clinical characteristics of a monogenic disease can be modified by common polygenic variants.

19900242|t|Testing for monogenic diabetes among children and adolescents with antibody-negative clinically defined Type 1 diabetes.
19900242|a|AIMS: Monogenic diabetes is frequently misdiagnosed as Type 1 diabetes. We aimed to screen for undiagnosed monogenic diabetes in a cohort of children who had a clinical diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes but were pancreatic autoantibody-negative. METHODS: We studied 252 patients diagnosed clinically with Type 1 diabetes between 6 months and 17 years of age. Pancreatic autoantibodies [islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) and/or insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies (IA2A)] were absent in 25 cases (9.9%). The most frequent genes involved in monogenic diabetes [KCNJ11 and INS for neonatal diabetes and HNF1A and HNF4A for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)] were directly sequenced. RESULTS: Two of the 25 (8%) antibody-negative patients had de novo heterozygous mutations in INS; c.94G&gt;A (G32S) and c.265C&gt;T (R89C). The two patients presented with non-ketotic hyperglycaemia at 8 and 11 months of age. In contrast, the four antibody-positive patients who presented at a similar age (6-12 months) had a more severe metabolic derangement, manifested as ketosis in all four cases, with ketoacidosis in two. At ages 15 and 5 years, both INS mutation patients were prescribed a replacement dose of insulin with good glycaemic control [glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) 7.0 and 7.2%]. No mutations were found in KCNJ11, HNF1A or HNF4A. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of patients with monogenic diabetes from children with clinically defined Type 1 diabetes may be helped by clinical criteria including the absence of pancreatic autoantibodies.

19929997|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1A and HNF4A substitution occurring simultaneously in a family with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
19929997|a|INTRODUCTION: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by an early age at onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in the function of the B-cells of the pancreas. We report a family with two members carrying a substitution in both the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1A and HNF4A gene simultaneously. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old man was referred because of mild diabetic retinopathy. Because of a dominant presentation of diabetes in his family, genetic testing was performed. Sequence analysis of the genes involved in MODY-1-3 revealed the presence of an amino acid substitution in the HNF1A as well as the HNF4A gene. Both substitutions were also detected in his mother. The HNF1A substitution has been described previously as pathogenic, whereas the HNF4A substitution had not been found previously. The HNF4A substitution was located in a conserved region of the protein and, additionally, the proband and his mother had high birthweights and low triglyceride levels, both of which are associated with pathogenic HNF4A substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first reported family carrying both a substitution of HNF1A and HNF4A gene simultaneously. The exact contribution of each substitution to the phenotype of our subjects remains to be further elucidated, however, given the high birthweights and the low triglyceride levels in those with both substitutions, it is reasonable that the HNF4A substitution is pathogenic.

19933992|a|OBJECTIVE: Assignment of the correct molecular diagnosis in diabetes is necessary for informed decisions regarding treatment and prognosis. Better clinical markers would facilitate discrimination and prioritization for genetic testing between diabetes subtypes. Serum 1,5 anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) levels were reported to differentiate maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A mutations (HNF1A-MODY) from type 2 diabetes, but this requires further validation. We evaluated serum 1,5AG in a range of diabetes subtypes as an adjunct for defining diabetes etiology. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 1,5AG was measured in U.K. subjects with: HNF1A-MODY (n = 23), MODY due to glucokinase mutations (GCK-MODY, n = 23), type 1 diabetes (n = 29), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA, n = 42), and type 2 diabetes (n = 206). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess discriminative accuracy of 1,5AG for diabetes etiology. RESULTS: Mean (SD range) 1,5AG levels were: GCK-MODY 13.06 microg/ml (5.74-29.74), HNF1A-MODY 4.23 microg/ml (2.12-8.44), type 1 diabetes 3.09 microg/ml (1.45-6.57), LADA 3.46 microg/ml (1.42-8.45), and type 2 diabetes 5.43 (2.12-13.23). Levels in GCK-MODY were higher than in other groups (P &lt; 10(-4) vs. each group). HNF1A-MODY subjects showed no difference in unadjusted 1,5AG levels from type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and LADA. Adjusting for A1C revealed a difference between HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001). The discriminative accuracy of unadjusted 1,5AG levels was 0.79 for GCK-MODY versus type 2 diabetes and 0.86 for GCK-MODY versus HNF1A-MODY but was only 0.60 for HNF1A-MODY versus type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In our dataset, serum 1,5AG performed well in discriminating GCK-MODY from other diabetes subtypes, particularly HNF1A-MODY. Measurement of 1,5AG levels could inform decisions regarding MODY diagnostic testing.

20132997|t|Three novel mutations in MODY and its phenotype in three different Czech families.
20132997|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) is an autosomal dominant inherited type of diabetes with significant genetic heterogeneity. New mutations causing MODY are still being found. A genetically confirmed diagnosis of MODY allows application of individualized treatment based on the underlying concrete genetic dysfunction. Detection of novel MODY mutations helps provide a more complete picture of the possible MODY genotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested 43 adult Czech patients with clinical characteristics of MODY, using direct sequencing of HNF1A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha), HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha) and GCK (glucokinase) genes. RESULTS: In three Czech families we identified three novel mutations we believe causing MODY-two missense mutations in HNF1A [F268L (c.802T&gt;C) and P291S (c.871C&gt;T)] and one frame shift mutation in GCK V244fsdelG (c.729delG). Some of the novel HNF1A mutation carriers were successfully transferred from insulin to gliclazide, while some of the novel GCK mutation carriers had a good clinical response when switched from insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs to diet. CONCLUSION: We describe three novel MODY mutations in three Czech families. The identification of MODY mutations had a meaningful impact on therapy on the mutation carriers.

20172480|t|Clinical differences between patients with MODY-3, MODY-2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene.
20172480|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to describe and evaluate the clinical and metabolic characteristics of patients with MODY-3, MODY-2 or type 2 diabetes who presented I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene. METHODS: The study included 31 previously diagnosed subjects under follow-up for MODY-3 (10 subjects from 5 families), MODY-2 (15 subjects from 9 families), or type 2 diabetes (6 subjects) with I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene. The demographic, clinical, metabolic, and genetic characteristics of all patients were analyzed. RESULTS: No differences were observed in distribution according to sex, age of onset, or form of diagnosis. All patients with MODY-2 or MODY-3 had a family history of diabetes. In contrast, 33.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene had no family history of diabetes (p &lt; 0.05). No differences were observed in body mass index, prevalence of hypertension, or microvascular or macrovascular complications. Drug therapy was required by 100% of MODY-3 patients, but not required by 100% of MODY-2 patients or 16.7% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Occasional difficulties may be encountered when classifying patients with MODY-2, MODY-3 or type 2 diabetes of atypical characteristics, in this case patients who present I27L polymorphism in the HNF1alpha gene.

20210571|t|Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors are efficient adjunct therapy in HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young patients--report of two cases.
20210571|a|BACKGROUND: In HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), sulfonylurea (SU) is the first-line treatment. Over time, such therapy fails, and additional treatment is required. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors are new agents that lower blood glucose by prolonging the activity of circulating incretins. METHODS: We applied DPP-IV inhibitors in two HNF1A MODY patients whose earlier therapeutic regimen included SU. RESULTS: Case 1, a 39-year-old woman, a carrier of the ArgR171X HNF1A mutation, with a 7-year history of diabetes was on 160 mg of gliclazide and 2,000 mg of metformin. Her initial hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was 7.2%, while the mean glucose level on the CGMS((R)) (Medtronic, Northridge, CA) record was 162 mg/dL. Sitagliptine, in a dose of 100 mg/day, was added to the previous treatment. Case 2, a 62-year-old woman, a carrier of the IVS7nt-6G&gt;A mutation, with a 41-year history of diabetes was treated with 240 mg/day gliclazide and 6 IU of insulin/day. Her initial HbA1c was 8.8%, and average glycemia reached 172 mg/dL. In her case, we started the combined therapy with 50 mg of vildagliptine twice daily. Patients were reexamined after 3 months, and HbA1c fell to 6.3% in both subjects. Similarly, significant improvement in glycemic control on CGMS was observed as the average glycemia decreased to 114 mg/dL and 134 mg/dL in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. No episodes of hypoglycemia or other side effects were recorded. As intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed before and after DPP-IV implementation, we were able to assess their impact on insulin secretion under fasting conditions. We saw a substantial rise in insulin level increment during IVGTT (by 9.8 and13.4 mIU/L in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: DPP-IV inhibitors may be an effective tool of combined therapy in HNF1A MODY, and they seem to improve beta-cell function under fasting conditions.

20361036|t|Gene-gene interactions lead to higher risk for development of type 2 diabetes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population.
20361036|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has accumulated that multiple genetic and environmental factors play important roles in determining susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although variants from candidate genes have become prime targets for genetic analysis, few studies have considered their interplay. Our goal was to evaluate interactions among SNPs within genes frequently identified as associated with T2D. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Logistic regression was used to study interactions among 4 SNPs, one each from HNF4A[rs1884613], TCF7L2[rs12255372], WFS1[rs10010131], and KCNJ11[rs5219] in a case-control Ashkenazi sample of 974 diabetic subjects and 896 controls. Nonparametric multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and generalized MDR (GMDR) were used to confirm findings from the logistic regression analysis. HNF4A and WFS1 SNPs were associated with T2D in logistic regression analyses [P&lt;0.0001, P&lt;0.0002, respectively]. Interaction between these SNPs were also strong using parametric or nonparametric methods: the unadjusted odds of being affected with T2D was 3 times greater in subjects with the HNF4A and WFS1 risk alleles than those without either (95% CI = [1.7-5.3]; P&lt;or=0.0001). Although the univariate association between the TCF7L2 SNP and T2D was relatively modest [P = 0.02], when paired with the HNF4A SNP, the OR for subjects with risk alleles in both SNPs was 2.4 [95% CI = 1.7-3.4; P&lt;or=0.0001]. The KCNJ11 variant reached significance only when paired with either the HNF4A or WFSI SNPs: unadjusted ORs were 2.0 [95% CI = 1.4-2.8; P&lt;or=0.0001] and 2.3 [95% CI = 1.2-4.4; P&lt;or=0.0001], respectively. MDR and GMDR results were consistent with the parametric findings. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of strong independent associations between T2D and SNPs in HNF4A and WFS1 and their interaction in our Ashkenazi sample. We also observed an interaction in the nonparametric analysis between the HNF4A and KCNJ11 SNPs (P&lt;or=0.001), demonstrating that an independently non-significant variant may interact with another variant resulting in an increased disease risk.

20531501|t|[Progress in diabetes genetics].
20531501|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes is classified as Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and other types. Our goal was to provide an overview of new genetic knowledge of monogenic and type 2 diabetes. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The article is based on literature identified through a non-systematic search in PubMed and own experience concerning research in diabetes genetics and treatment of patients with monogenic diabetes. RESULTS: 18 genes have been found for which one single mutation may cause diabetes. The most common causes for such monogenic diabetes are mutations in the genes KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS when the condition is diagnosed at the age 0 - 6 months, and in the genes HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A and HNF1B when the diagnosis is made later than six months of age. Genetic testing is appropriate in assessment of monogenic diabetes, because antidiabetic tablets rather that insulin injections can be used to treat patients with mutations in certain genes; i.e. KCNJ11, ABCC8, HNF1A and HNF4A. Genome-wide association studies have recently identified about 20 genetic variants that increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes, but which have a low predictive value for development of disease. How these genetic variants can cause Type 2 diabetes has not been assessed and clinical relevance remains to be shown. INTERPRETATION: So far, genetic findings only affect diagnosis and treatment of monogenic diabetes.

20546258|t|Increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in monogenic diabetes as a result of mutations in the HNF1A gene.
20546258|a|AIMS: To investigate all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with diabetes caused by a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha gene (HNF1A). METHODS: We identified 39 British families with HNF1A mutations. Consenting individuals were asked details of age and cause of death of parents and siblings. Copies of death certificates were requested from the family or were obtained via the Offices for National Statistics. RESULTS: Data were collated on 241 control subjects and 153 mutation carriers. Of those who died, 66% of mutation carriers died from a cardiovascular-related illness compared with 43% of control subjects (P = 0.02). Family members with HNF1A mutations died at a younger age than familial control subjects [all-cause hazard ratio, adjusting for sex and smoking status: 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2, 2.9, P = 0.006; cardiovascular hazard ratio: 2.3, confidence interval 1.3, 4.2, P = 0.006)]. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that individuals known to have diabetes caused by a mutation in the HNF1A gene have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with their unaffected family members. As with other forms of diabetes, consideration should be given to early statin therapy despite a seemingly protective lipid profile.

20581827|t|Twelve type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci identified through large-scale association analysis.
20581827|a|By combining genome-wide association data from 8,130 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 38,987 controls of European descent and following up previously unidentified meta-analysis signals in a further 34,412 cases and 59,925 controls, we identified 12 new T2D association signals with combined P&lt;5x10(-8). These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits.

20705777|t|Double heterozygous mutations involving both HNF1A/MODY3 and HNF4A/MODY1 genes: a case report.
20705777|a|OBJECTIVE: We describe a maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) case with mutations involving both HNF4A and HNF1A genes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A male patient was diagnosed with diabetes at age 17; the metabolic control rapidly worsened to insulin requirement. At that time no relatives were known to be affected by diabetes, which was diagnosed years later in both the parents (father at age 50 years, mother at age 54 years) and the sister (at age 32 years, during pregnancy). RESULTS: The genetic screening showed a double heterozygosity for the mutation p.E508K in the HNF1A/MODY3 gene and the novel variant p.R80Q in the HNF4A/MODY1 gene. The genetic testing of the family showed that the father carried the MODY3 mutation while the mother, the sister, and her two children carried the MODY1 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: MODY1 and MODY3 mutations may interact by chance to give a more severe form of diabetes (younger age at presentation and early need of insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia).

20716378|t|Assessing the association of the HNF1A G319S variant with C-reactive protein in Aboriginal Canadians: a population-based epidemiological study.
20716378|a|BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of inflammation, has been associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Common variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) gene encoding HNF-1alpha have been associated with plasma CRP in predominantly European Caucasian samples. HNF1A might therefore have an impact on vascular disease and diabetes risk that is mediated by CRP. In an Aboriginal Canadian population, a private polymorphism, HNF1A G319S, was associated with increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. However, it has not been investigated whether this association is mediated by CRP. We aimed to investigate whether CRP was mediating the association between HNF1A G319S and type 2 diabetes in an Aboriginal Canadian population with a high prevalence of diabetes. METHODS: A total of 718 individuals who participated in a diabetes prevalence and risk factor survey were included in the current analysis. Participants were genotyped for HNF1A G319S. Fasting plasma samples were analyzed for CRP. Fasting plasma glucose and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test were obtained to determine type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes was 17.4% (125/718) using the 1999 World Health Organization definition and was higher among S319 allele carriers compared to G/G homozygotes (p &lt; 0.0001). Among participants without type 2 diabetes, CRP levels were higher among G/G homozygotes (1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.35-2.00] mg/l) than in S319 carriers (1.26 [1.04-1.54] mg/l) (p = 0.009) after adjustment for age, sex, 2-h post-load glucose, waist circumference, and serum amyloid A. CRP levels were elevated among those with diabetes after similar adjustment (4.39 [95% confidence interval 3.09-6.23] and 4.44 [3.13-6.30] mg/L, respectively), and no significant difference in CRP was observed between S319 carriers and non-carriers (p = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels were lower in S319 allele carriers of the HNF1A gene compared to non-carriers among individuals without diabetes, but this difference was not present among those with diabetes, who uniformly had elevated CRP levels. Therefore, while HNF1A appears to influence CRP concentrations in the non-diabetic state, chronic elevation of CRP is unlikely mediating the association between the HNF1A polymorphism and the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in this Aboriginal population.

20724646|t|Assessment of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels as diagnostic discriminator of maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A mutations.
20724646|a|OBJECTIVE: Despite the clinical importance of an accurate diagnosis in individuals with monogenic forms of diabetes, restricted access to genetic testing leaves many patients with undiagnosed diabetes. Recently, common variation near the HNF1 homeobox A (HNF1A) gene was shown to influence C-reactive protein levels in healthy adults. We hypothesized that serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) could represent a clinically useful biomarker for the identification of HNF1A mutations causing maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum hs-CRP was measured in subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 31), autoimmune diabetes (n = 316), type 2 diabetes (n = 240), and glucokinase (GCK) MODY (n = 24) and in nondiabetic individuals (n = 198). The discriminative accuracy of hs-CRP was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and performance was compared with standard diagnostic criteria. Our primary analyses excluded approximately 11% of subjects in whom the single available hs-CRP measurement was &gt;10 mg/l. RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD range) hs-CRP levels were significantly lower (P &lt;or= 0.009) for HNF1A-MODY individuals, 0.20 (0.03-1.14) mg/l, than for any other group: autoimmune diabetes 0.58 (0.10-2.75) mg/l, type 2 diabetes 1.33 (0.28-6.14) mg/l, GCK-MODY 1.01 (0.19-5.33) mg/l, and nondiabetic 0.48 (0.10-2.42) mg/l. The ROC-derived C-statistic for discriminating HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes was 0.8. Measurement of hs-CRP, either alone or in combination with current diagnostic criteria, was superior to current diagnostic criteria alone. Sensitivity and specificity for the combined criteria approached 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Serum hs-CRP levels are markedly lower in HNF1A-MODY than in other forms of diabetes. hs-CRP has potential as a widely available, cost-effective screening test to support more precise targeting of MODY diagnostic testing.

21105491|t|Familial young-onset forms of diabetes related to HNF4A and rare HNF1A molecular aetiologies.
21105491|a|OBJECTIVE: We have dissected the rare molecular anomalies that may affect hepatocyte nuclear factor-1a (HNF1A) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a (HNF4A) in patients with familial young-onset diabetes for whom HNF1A mutations have been excluded by sequence analysis. METHODS: Eighty-four unrelatedHNF1A-negative patients with diabetes diagnosed before the age of 40 years, a family history of diabetes and the absence of features suggestive of Type 2 diabetes were included. We analysed by sequencing the HNF4A promoter and coding regions, the HNF1A promoter region and specific regions of HNF1A(B) and HNF1A(C) isoforms and searched for large deletions of HNF1A and HNF4A by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). RESULTS: We identified five novel HNF4A mutations (5 / 84, 6%), including four missense and one in-frame deletion, and one mutation of the HNF1A promoter (1 / 84). Sequence analysis of isoform-specific coding regions of HNF1A did not reveal any mutation. We next identified two whole gene deletions of HNF1A and HNF4A, respectively (2 / 84, 2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the search for rare molecular events in HNF1A and HNF4A led us to elucidate 8 / 84 (9.5%) of our HNF1A-negative cases.This study shows that genetic aetiologies remain to be elucidated in familial young-onset diabetes. It also highlights the difficulty of the differential diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes because of the wide clinical expression of monogenic young-onset diabetes and the absence of specific biomarkers.

21168233|t|HNF1 alpha gene coding regions mutations screening, in a Caucasian population clinically characterized as MODY from Argentina.
21168233|a|INTRODUCTION: There are at least six subtypes of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) with distinctive genetic causes. MODY 3 is caused by mutations in HNF1A gene, an insulin transcription factor, so mutations in this gene are associated with impaired insulin secretion. MODY 3 prevalence differs according to the population analyzed, but it is one of the most frequent subtypes. Therefore, our aims in this work were to find mutations present in the HNF1A gene and provide information on their prevalence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mutations screening was done in a group of 80 unrelated patients (average age 17.1 years) selected by clinical characterization of MODY, by SSCP electrophoresis followed by sequenciation. RESULTS: We found eight mutations, of which six were novel and four sequence variants, which were all novel. Therefore the prevalence of MODY 3 in this group was 10%. Compared clinical data between the non-MODY 3 patients and the MODY 3 diagnosed patients did not show any significant difference. DISCUSSION: Eight patients were diagnosed as MODY 3 and new data about the prevalence of that subtype is provided. Our results contribute to reveal novel mutations, providing new data about the prevalence of that subtype.

21170474|t|Differential effects of HNF-1alpha mutations associated with familial young-onset diabetes on target gene regulation.
21170474|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF-1alpha) is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in a variety of tissues (including liver and pancreas) that regulates a wide range of genes. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding HNF-1alpha (HNF1A) cause familial young-onset diabetes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (MODY3). The variability of the MODY3 clinical phenotype can be due to environmental and genetic factors as well as to the type and position of mutations. Thus, functional characterization of HNF1A mutations might provide insight into the molecular defects explaining the variability of the MODY3 phenotype. We have functionally characterized six HNF1A mutations identified in diabetic patients: two novel ones, p.Glu235Gly and c-57-64delCACGCGGT;c-55G&gt;C; and four previously described, p.Val133Met, p.Thr196Ala, p.Arg271Trp and p.Pro379Arg. The effects of mutations on transcriptional activity have been measured by reporter assays on a subset of HNF-1alpha target promoters in Cos7 and Min6 cells. Target DNA binding affinities have been quantified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-HNF-1alpha fusion proteins and nuclear extracts of transfected Cos7 cells. Our functional studies revealed that mutation c-57-64delCACGCGGT;c-55G&gt;C reduces HNF1A promoter activity in Min6 cells and that missense mutations have variable effects. Mutation p.Arg271Trp impairs HNF-1alpha activity in all conditions tested, whereas mutations p.Val133Met, p.Glu235Gly and p.Pro379Arg exert differential effects depending on the target promoter. In contrast, substitution p.Thr196Ala does not appear to alter HNF-1alpha function. Our results suggest that HNF1A mutations may have differential effects on the regulation of specific target genes, which could contribute to the variability of the MODY3 clinical phenotype.

21193557|t|Hnf1alpha (MODY3) regulates beta-cell-enriched MafA transcription factor expression.
21193557|a|The expression pattern of genes important for pancreatic islet cell function requires the actions of cell-enriched transcription factors. Musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma homolog A (MafA) is a beta-cell-specific transcriptional activator critical to adult islet beta-cell function, with MafA mutant mice manifesting symptoms associated with human type 2 diabetes. Here, we describe that MafA expression is controlled by hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (Hnf1alpha), the transcription factor gene mutated in the most common monoallelic form of maturity onset diabetes of the young. There are six conserved sequence domains in the 5'-flanking MafA promoter, of which one, region 3 (R3) [base pair (bp) -8118/-7750] is principally involved in controlling the unique developmental and adult islet beta-cell-specific expression pattern. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that Hnf1alpha bound specifically within R3. Furthermore, in vitro DNA-binding experiments localized an Hnf1alpha regulatory element between bp -7822 and -7793, an area previously associated with stimulation by the islet developmental regulator, Islet1. However, site-directed mutational studies showed that Hnf1alpha was essential to R3-driven reporter activation through bp -7816/-7811. Significantly, MafA levels were dramatically reduced in the insulin(+) cell population remaining in embryonic and adult Hnf1alpha(-/-) pancreata. Our results demonstrate that Hnf1alpha regulates MafA in beta-cells and suggests that compromised MafA expression contributes to beta-cell dysfunction in maturity onset diabetes of the young.

21208426|t|HNF1A G319S variant, active cigarette smoking and incident type 2 diabetes in Aboriginal Canadians: a population-based epidemiological study.
21208426|a|BACKGROUND: In a recent report of large-scale association analysis, a type 2 diabetes susceptibility locus near HNF1A was identified in predominantly European descent populations. A population-specific G319S polymorphism in HNF1A was previously identified in Aboriginal Canadians who have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate the association of the HNF1A G319S polymorphism with incident type 2 diabetes and to assess whether clinical risk variables for type 2 diabetes influence the association in an Aboriginal population. METHODS: Of 606 participants who were free of diabetes at baseline in 1993-1995, 540 (89.1%) participated in 10-year follow-up assessments in 2003-2005. Fasting glucose and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test were obtained to determine incident type 2 diabetes. Participants were genotyped for the HNF1A G319S polymorphism. Interviewers administered questionnaires on smoking behavior. RESULTS: The incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were 14.2% (55/388) in major allele homozygotes and 31.2% (29/93) in minor allele carriers (p &lt; 0.001). The HNF1A G319S carrier status was associated with incident type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.78 [95% CI 2.13-6.69]) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and waist circumference. A statistical interaction was observed between HNF1A G319S and baseline active cigarette smoking on the development of type 2 diabetes with similar adjustment (p = 0.006). When participants were stratified by baseline smoking status, HNF1A G319S carriers who were active smokers had increased risk of developing diabetes (OR 6.91 [95% CI 3.38-14.12]), while the association was attenuated to non-significance among non-smokers (1.11 [0.40-3.08]). CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A G319S variant is associated with incident type 2 diabetes in Aboriginal Canadians. Furthermore, cigarette smoking appears to amplify incident diabetes risk in carriers of HNF1A G319S.

21236713|t|GCKR mutations in Japanese families with clustered type 2 diabetes.
21236713|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the genetic background of familial clustering of type 2 diabetes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited Japanese families with a 3-generation history of diabetes. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed assuming an autosomal dominant model. Genes in the linkage region were computationally prioritized using Endeavour. We sequenced the candidate genes, and the frequencies of detected nucleotide changes were then examined in normoglycemic controls. RESULTS: To exclude known genetic factors, we sequenced 6 maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes in 10 familial cases. Because we detected a MODY3 mutation HNF1A R583G in one case, we excluded this case from further investigation. Linkage analysis revealed a significant linkage region on 2p25-22 (LOD score=3.47) for 4 families. The 23.6-Mb linkage region contained 106 genes. Those genes were scored by computational prioritization. Eleven genes, i.e., top 10% of 106 genes, were selected and considered primary candidates. Considering their functions, we eliminated 3 well characterized genes and finally sequenced 8 genes. GCKR ranked highly in the computational prioritization. Mutations (minor allele frequency less than 1%) in exons and the promoter of GCKR were found in index cases of the families (3 of 18 alleles) more frequently than in controls (0 of 36 alleles, P=0.033). In one pedigree with 9 affected members, the mutation GCKR g.6859C&gt;G was concordant with affection status. No mutation in other 7 genes that ranked highly in the prioritization was concordant with affection status in families. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that GCKR is a susceptibility gene in Japanese families with clustered diabetes. The family based approach seems to be complementary with a large population study.

21267535|t|Type 2 diabetes risk allele near CENTD2 is associated with decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release.
21267535|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: By combining multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies and comprehensive replication efforts, 12 novel type 2 diabetes associated loci have recently been discovered. Here we evaluate the effect of lead variants of these loci on estimates of insulin release and insulin resistance derived from an oral glucose tolerance test. METHODS: We examined 12 lead variants in or near HMGA2, CENTD2 (also known as ARAP1), KLF14, PRC1, TP53INP1, ZBED3, ZFAND6, CHCHD9, DUSP9, KCNQ1, BCL11A and HNF1A in 5,722 middle-aged people from the population-based Inter99 sample. RESULTS: Carriers of the major diabetogenic allele of rs1552224 in CENTD2 had increased 30-min plasma glucose values (2.0%, p = 2 x 10(-5)) as well as 4.2% reduced insulin release 30 min after an oral glucose load (p = 0.001). Risk allele carriers also had decreased BIGTT-acute insulin release (AIR), which is a surrogate measure of insulin release where sex, BMI, plasma glucose and serum insulin are integrated (5.3%, p = 8 x 10(-7)). In addition, a decreased corrected insulin response (CIR; 9.9%, p = 3 x 10(-8)) was observed. For rs5945326 near DUSP9 on the X-chromosome we stratified according to sex. Male carriers of the risk allele showed nominally decreased BIGTT-AIR (2.6%, p = 0.01). No associations with intermediate metabolic traits were found in women. For the remaining ten lead variants no consistent associations were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Of the lead variants from 12 novel type 2 diabetes associated loci, CENTD2 significantly associated with increased plasma glucose values and decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release, suggesting that the diabetogenic effect of this locus is mediated through an impaired pancreatic beta cell function.

21270186|t|Urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio is a practical outpatient tool for identifying hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-{alpha}/hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-{alpha} maturity-onset diabetes of the young from long-duration type 1 diabetes.
21270186|a|OBJECTIVE: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A)/hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes, and patients are inappropriately treated with insulin. Blood C-peptide can aid in the diagnosis of MODY, but practical reasons limit its widespread use. Urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR), a stable measure of endogenous insulin secretion, is a noninvasive alternative. We aimed to compare stimulated UCPCR in adults with HNF1A/4A MODY, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with diabetes for &gt;= 5 years, without renal impairment, were studied (HNF1A MODY [n = 54], HNF4A MODY [n = 23], glucokinase MODY [n = 20], type 1 diabetes [n = 69], and type 2 diabetes [n = 54]). The UCPCR was collected in boric acid 120 min after the largest meal of the day and mailed for analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify optimal UCPCR cutoffs to differentiate HNF1A/4A MODY from type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: UCPCR was lower in type 1 diabetes than HNF1A/4A MODY (median [interquartile range]) (&lt;0.02 nmol/mmol [&lt;0.02 to &lt;0.02] vs. 1.72 nmol/mmol [0.98-2.90]; P &lt; 0.0001). ROC curves showed excellent discrimination (area under curve [AUC] 0.98) and identified a cutoff UCPCR of &gt;= 0.2 nmol/mmol for differentiating HNF1A/4A MODY from type 1 diabetes (97% sensitivity, 96% specificity). UCPCR was lower in HNF1A/4A MODY than in type 2 diabetes (1.72 nmol/mmol [0.98-2.90] vs. 2.47 nmol/mmol [1.4-4.13]); P = 0.007). ROC curves showed a weak distinction between HNF1A/4A MODY and type 2 diabetes (AUC 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: UCPCR is a noninvasive outpatient tool that can be used to discriminate HNF1A and HNF4A MODY from long-duration type 1 diabetes. To differentiate MODY from type 1 diabetes of &gt;5 years' duration, UCPCR could be used to determine whether genetic testing is indicated.

21647700|t|Genome-wide association and meta-analysis in populations from Starr County, Texas, and Mexico City identify type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci and enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci in top signals.
21647700|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses to identify and characterise risk loci for type 2 diabetes in Mexican-Americans from Starr County, TX, USA. METHOD: Using 1.8 million directly interrogated and imputed genotypes in 837 unrelated type 2 diabetes cases and 436 normoglycaemic controls, we conducted Armitage trend tests. To improve power in this population with high disease rates, we also performed ordinal regression including an intermediate class with impaired fasting glucose and/or glucose tolerance. These analyses were followed by meta-analysis with a study of 967 type 2 diabetes cases and 343 normoglycaemic controls from Mexico City, Mexico. RESULT: The top signals (unadjusted p value &lt;1 x 10(-5)) included 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight gene regions (PER3, PARD3B, EPHA4, TOMM7, PTPRD, HNT [also known as RREB1], LOC729993 and IL34) and six intergenic regions. Among these was a missense polymorphism (rs10462020; Gly639Val) in the clock gene PER3, a system recently implicated in diabetes. We also report a second signal (minimum p value 1.52 x 10(-6)) within PTPRD, independent of the previously implicated SNP, in a population of Han Chinese. Top meta-analysis signals included known regions HNF1A and KCNQ1. Annotation of top association signals in both studies revealed a marked excess of trans-acting eQTL in both adipose and muscle tissues. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the largest study of type 2 diabetes in Mexican populations to date, we identified modest associations of novel and previously reported SNPs. In addition, in our top signals we report significant excess of SNPs that predict transcript levels in muscle and adipose tissues.

21648289|t|HNF1A mutation presenting with fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood prior to onset of overt diabetes.
21648289|a|BACKGROUND: HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) is a common subtype of autosomal dominant diabetes. Unlike HNF4-MODY where fetal macrosomia and early postnatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been reported, history of transient insulin overproduction has not yet been recognized in individuals with HNF1A-MODY. CASE REPORT: Here, we report on a 40-year-old male patient with HNF1A mutation p.Arg272His (c.815G&gt;A) having a history of fetal macrosomia (4750 g, 59 cm), and, at least, one attack of symptomatic hypoglycemia in childhood. Diabetes was subsequently diagnosed at 19 years of age. The proband's daughter who developed diabetes at 16 years carries the same mutation, but her birth weight and length were in the upper normal range, and she never experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. CONCLUSION: The observation of fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood is indicative of a biphasic impact of the HNF1A mutation on p-cell function over the lifespan, leading from inappropriate insulin oversecretion to final clinical diabetes.

21677039|t|Clinical characteristics and diagnostic criteria of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to molecular anomalies of the HNF1A gene.
21677039|a|CONTEXT: The diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), associated with HNF1A molecular abnormalities, is often missed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe the phenotypes of a large series of MODY3 patients and to reassess parameters that may improve its diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This retrospective multicenter study included 487 unrelated patients referred because of suspicion of MODY3. Genetic analysis identified 196 MODY3 and 283 non-MODY3 cases. Criteria associated with MODY3 were assessed by multivariate analysis. The capacity of the model to predict MODY3 diagnosis was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and was further validated in an independent sample of 851 patients (165 MODY3 and 686 non-MODY3). RESULTS: In the MODY3 patients, diabetes was revealed by clinical symptoms in 25% of the cases and was diagnosed by screening in the others. Age at diagnosis of diabetes was more than 25 yr in 40% of the MODY3 patients. There was considerable variability and overlap of all assessed parameters in MODY3 and non-MODY3 patients. The best predictive model was based on criteria available at diagnosis of diabetes, including age, body mass index, number of affected generations, presence of diabetes symptoms, and geographical origin. The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic analysis was 0.81. When sensitivity was set to 90%, specificity was 49%. CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis between MODY3 and early-onset type 2 diabetes remains difficult. Whether the proposed model will improve the pick-up rate of MODY3 diagnosis needs to be confirmed in independent populations.

21683639|t|Identification of HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY in Irish families: phenotypic characteristics and therapeutic implications.
21683639|a|AIM: The prevalence of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1A and HNF4A mutations, and the clinical implications following the genetic diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in the Irish population, remain unknown. The aim of this study was to establish the occurrence of HNF1A and HNF4A mutations in subjects classified clinically as MODY to identify novel mutations, and to determine the phenotypic features and response to therapy. METHODS: A total of 36 unrelated index cases with a clinical diagnosis of MODY were analyzed for HNF1A/HNF4A mutations. OGTT was performed to determine the degree of glucose tolerance and insulin secretory response. Also, 38 relatives underwent OGTT and were tested for the relevant known mutations. HNF1A-/HNF4A-MODY subjects were compared with nine HNF1A mutation-negative relatives and 20 type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients. RESULTS: Seven different HNF1A mutations were identified in 11/36 (30.5%) index cases, two of which were novel (S352fsdelG and F426X), as well as two novel HNF4A mutations (M1? and R290C; 6%). Family screening revealed 20 subjects with HNF1A and seven with HNF4A mutations. Only 51.6% of HNF1A mutation carriers were diagnosed with diabetes by age 25 years; 11 of the mutation carriers were overweight and four were obese. Insulin secretory response to glucose was significantly lower in HNF1A-MODY subjects than in T2DM patients and HNF1A mutation-negative relatives (P=0.01). Therapeutic changes occurred in 48% of mutation carriers following genetic diagnosis. CONCLUSION: There was an HNF1A-MODY pick-up rate of 30.5% and an HNF4A-MODY pick-up rate of 6% in Irish MODY families. Genetically confirmed MODY has significant therapeutic implications.

21696527|t|Onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in two patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young.
21696527|a|The association between maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been rarely described. We report two patients affected by MODY who developed T1DM. Case 1: a 4-yr-old girl referred for glycosuria presented hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.6%. Islet cell antibodies (ICA) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) were initially negative. As her father, uncle and grandmother showed mild hyperglycemia, they were screened for MODY 2. A novel mutation in glucokinase gene was found in the family. Few months later, her glycemic control worsened consistently and she required insulin treatment. A high titer of GADA and ICA was then detected. Six years afterwards insulin requirement is 0.8 U/kg and HbA1c 6.7%. Case 2: a 15-yr-old boy treated for growth hormone deficiency was found with a blood glucose level of 106 mg/dL. HbA1c was 7.2%, ICA and GADA were negative. Family history was positive for autoimmune diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient was investigated for MODY 2 and MODY 3, and a mutation of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene was found. The same mutation was found in the mother who had never been referred for hyperglycemia. After 1 yr, due to an unjustified worsening of the metabolic control, autoimmunity was again investigated and a mild positivity was found. He then required insulin therapy and after 5 yr current HbA1c was 8.2%. The diagnosis of MODY does not exclude the risk of developing T1DM. Therefore autoimmunity should be investigated when ordinary treatments fail and metabolic control unexpectedly worsens.

21700917|t|High-sensitivity CRP discriminates HNF1A-MODY from other subtypes of diabetes.
21700917|a|OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) as a result of mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) is often misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Recent work has shown that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are lower in HNF1A-MODY than type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or glucokinase (GCK)-MODY. We aim to replicate these findings in larger numbers and other MODY subtypes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: hs-CRP levels were assessed in 750 patients (220 HNF1A, 245 GCK, 54 HNF4-alpha [HNF4A], 21 HNF1-beta (HNF1B), 53 type 1 diabetes, and 157 type 2 diabetes). RESULTS: hs-CRP was lower in HNF1A-MODY (median [IQR] 0.3 [0.1-0.6] mg/L) than type 2 diabetes (1.40 [0.60-3.45] mg/L; P &lt; 0.001) and type 1 diabetes (1.10 [0.50-1.85] mg/L; P &lt; 0.001), HNF4A-MODY (1.45 [0.46-2.88] mg/L; P &lt; 0.001), GCK-MODY (0.60 [0.30-1.80] mg/L; P &lt; 0.001), and HNF1B-MODY (0.60 [0.10-2.8] mg/L; P = 0.07). hs-CRP discriminated HNF1A-MODY from type 2 diabetes with hs-CRP &lt;0.75 mg/L showing 79% sensitivity and 70% specificity (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: hs-CRP levels are lower in HNF1A-MODY than other forms of diabetes and may be used as a biomarker to select patients for diagnostic HNF1A genetic testing.

21784843|t|Hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) dysfunction down-regulates X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and sensitizes beta-cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
21784843|a|Correct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function is critical for the health of secretory cells, such as the pancreatic beta-cell, and ER stress is often a contributory factor to beta-cell death in type 2 diabetes. We have used an insulin-secreting cell line with inducible expression of dominant negative (DN) HNF1alpha, a transcription factor vital for correct beta-cell development and function, to show that HNF1alpha is required for Xbp1 transcription and maintenance of the normal ER stress response. DN HNF1alpha expression sensitizes the beta-cell to ER stress by directly down-regulating Xbp1 transcription, whereas Atf6 is unaffected. Furthermore, DN HNF1alpha alters calcium homeostasis, resulting in elevated cytoplasmic calcium and increased store-operated calcium entry, whereas mitochondrial calcium uptake is normal. Loss of function of XBP1 is toxic to the beta-cell and decreases production of the ER chaperone BiP, even in the absence of ER stress. DN HNF1alpha-induced sensitivity to cyclopiazonic acid can be partially rescued with the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholate. Rat insulin 2 promoter-DN HNF1alpha mouse islets express lower levels of BiP mRNA, synthesize less insulin, and are sensitized to ER stress relative to matched control mouse islets, suggesting that this mechanism is also operating in vivo.

21814221|t|Association of variants in genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell development and function with type 2 diabetes in North Indians.
21814221|a|Variants in genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell development and function are known to cause monogenic forms of type 2 diabetes and are also associated with complex form. In this study, we studied the genetic association of polymorphisms in such important genes with type 2 diabetes in the high-risk Indians. We genotyped 91 polymorphisms in 19 genes (ABCC8, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, INS, INSM1, ISL1, KCNJ11, MAFA, MNX1, NEUROD1, NEUROG3, NKX2.2, NKX6.1, PAX4, PAX6, PDX1, USF1 and WFS1) in 2025 unrelated North Indians of Indo-European ethnicity comprising of 1019 diabetic and 1006 non-diabetic subjects. HNF4A promoter P2 polymorphisms rs1884613 and rs2144908, which are in high linkage disequilibrium, showed significant association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR)=1.37 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.57), P=9.4 x 10(-6) for rs1884613 and OR=1.37 (95%CI 1.20-1.57), P=6.0 x 10(-6) for rs2144908), as previously shown in other populations. We observed body mass index-dependent association of these variants with type 2 diabetes in normal-weight/lean subjects. Variants in USF1, ABCC8, ISL1 and KCNJ11 showed nominal association, while haplotypes in these genes were significantly associated. rs3812704 upstream of NEUROG3 significantly increased risk for type 2 diabetes in normal-weight/lean subjects (OR=1.68 (95%CI 1.25-2.24), P=4.9 x 10(-4)). Thus, pancreatic beta-cell development and function genes contribute to susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in North Indians.

21814873|t|A large multi-centre European study validates high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) as a clinical biomarker for the diagnosis of diabetes subtypes.
21814873|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: An accurate molecular diagnosis of diabetes subtype confers clinical benefits; however, many individuals with monogenic diabetes remain undiagnosed. Biomarkers could help to prioritise patients for genetic investigation. We recently demonstrated that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels are lower in UK patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY than in other diabetes subtypes. In this large multi-centre study we aimed to assess the clinical validity of hsCRP as a diagnostic biomarker, examine the genotype-phenotype relationship and compare different hsCRP assays. METHODS: High-sensitivity CRP levels were analysed in individuals with HNF1A-MODY (n = 457), glucokinase (GCK)-MODY (n = 404), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A)-MODY (n = 54) and type 2 diabetes (n = 582) from seven European centres. Three common assays for hsCRP analysis were evaluated. We excluded 121 participants (8.1%) with hsCRP values &gt;10 mg/l. The discriminative power of hsCRP with respect to diabetes aetiology was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve-derived C-statistic. RESULTS: In all centres and irrespective of the assay method, meta-analysis confirmed significantly lower hsCRP levels in those with HNF1A-MODY than in those with other aetiologies (z score -21.8, p &lt; 5 x 10(-105)). HNF1A-MODY cases with missense mutations had lower hsCRP levels than those with truncating mutations (0.03 vs 0.08 mg/l, p &lt; 5 x 10(-5)). High-sensitivity CRP values between assays were strongly correlated (r (2) &gt;= 0.91, p &lt;= 1 x 10(-5)). Across the seven centres, the C-statistic for distinguishing HNF1A-MODY from young adult-onset type 2 diabetes ranged from 0.79 to 0.97, indicating high discriminative accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the largest study to date, we have established that hsCRP is a clinically valid biomarker for HNF1A-MODY in European populations. Given the modest costs and wide availability, hsCRP could translate rapidly into clinical practice, considerably improving diagnosis rates in monogenic diabetes.

21823540|t|HNF1A mutation presenting with fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood prior to onset of overt diabetes.
21823540|a|BACKGROUND: HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) is a common subtype of autosomal dominant diabetes. Unlike HNF4-MODY where fetal macrosomia and early postnatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been reported, a history of transient insulin overproduction has not been recognized in individuals with HNF1A-MODY yet. CASE REPORT: Here, we report a 40-year-old male patient with HNFJA mutation p.Arg272His (c.815G&gt;A) with a history of fetal macrosomia (4750 g, 59 cm) and, at least, one attack of symptomatic hypoglycemia in childhood. Diabetes was subsequently diagnosed at 19 years. The proband's daughter who developed diabetes at 16 years carries the same mutation, but her birth weight and length were in the upper normal range, and she never experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. CONCLUSION: The observation of fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood is suggestive of a biphasic impact of the HNF1A mutation on beta-cell function over the lifespan, leading from inappropriate insulin oversecretion to final clinical diabetes.

21841783|t|Pathway to diabetes through attenuation of pancreatic beta cell glycosylation and glucose transport.
21841783|a|A connection between diet, obesity and diabetes exists in multiple species and is the basis of an escalating human health problem. The factors responsible provoke both insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction but remain to be fully identified. We report a combination of molecular events in human and mouse pancreatic beta cells, induced by elevated levels of free fatty acids or by administration of a high-fat diet with associated obesity, that comprise a pathogenic pathway to diabetes. Elevated concentrations of free fatty acids caused nuclear exclusion and reduced expression of the transcription factors FOXA2 and HNF1A in beta cells. This resulted in a deficit of GnT-4a glycosyltransferase expression in beta cells that produced signs of metabolic disease, including hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis and diminished insulin action in muscle and adipose tissues. Protection from disease was conferred by enforced beta cell-specific GnT-4a protein glycosylation and involved the maintenance of glucose transporter expression and the preservation of glucose transport. We observed that this pathogenic process was active in human islet cells obtained from donors with type 2 diabetes; thus, illuminating a pathway to disease implicated in the diet- and obesity-associated component of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

21874357|t|Rapamycin protects against dominant negative-HNF1A-induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells.
21874357|a|HNF1A-maturity onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) is caused by mutations in Hnf1a gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A). An increased rate of apoptosis has been associated with the decrease in beta-cell mass that is a hallmark of HNF1A-MODY and other forms of diabetes. In a cellular model of HNF1A-MODY, we have recently shown that signalling through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is decreased by the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of HNF1A (DN-HNF1A). mTOR is a protein kinase which has important roles in cell metabolism and growth, but also in cell survival, where it has been shown to be both protective and detrimental. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR activity with rapamycin protected INS-1 cells against DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis. Rapamycin also prevented DN-HNF1A-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an intracellular energy sensor which we have previously shown to mediate DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis. Conversely, activation of mTOR with leucine potentiated DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis. Gene silencing of raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), a subunit of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), also conferred protection on INS-1 cells against DN-HNF1A-induced apoptosis, confirming that mTORC1 mediates the protective effect. The potential relevance of this effect with regards to the clinical use of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant in diabetics post-transplantation is discussed.

21937998|t|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms at five loci are associated with C-reactive protein levels in a cohort of Filipino young adults.
21937998|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) is a component of nonspecific immune defense and is a reliable marker of low-grade inflammation involved in obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Genome-wide association studies in middle-aged and elderly populations, predominantly of European descent, demonstrated associations of CRP levels with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at several loci. To examine whether the variants identified are replicated in Filipino young adults, we applied Tobit regression models to study the association of plasma CRP with 12 SNPs at seven loci in a cohort of 1691 Filipino young adults (aged 21.5+-0.3 years) from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. SNPs in or near CRP (P=3.2 x 10(-11)), HNF1A, IL6R, APOE-APOC1 and LEPR showed significant associations (P&lt;0.05) and together explained 4.8% of the total variation in CRP. Modest interactions were observed between LEPR-rs1892534 and waist circumference (uncorrected P(interaction)=0.020) and between APOE-rs769449 and pathogen exposure (uncorrected P(interaction)=0.0073) in models predicting CRP. Our results demonstrated that variants in several loci are significantly associated with plasma CRP in Filipino young adults, suggesting shared genetic influences on circulating CRP across populations and age groups.

21989597|t|Heterozygous ABCC8 mutations are a cause of MODY.
21989597|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The ABCC8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunit of the pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel. Inactivating mutations cause congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) and activating mutations cause transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM) or permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) that can usually be treated with sulfonylureas. Sulfonylurea sensitivity is also a feature of HNF1A and HNF4A MODY, but patients referred for genetic testing with clinical features of these types of diabetes do not always have mutations in the HNF1A/4A genes. Our aim was to establish whether mutations in the ABCC8 gene cause MODY that is responsive to sulfonylurea therapy. METHODS: We sequenced the ABCC8 gene in 85 patients with a BMI &lt;30 kg/m2, no family history of neonatal diabetes and who were deemed sensitive to sulfonylureas by the referring clinician or were sulfonylurea-treated. All had tested negative for mutations in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes. RESULTS: ABCC8 mutations were found in seven of the 85 (8%) probands. Four patients were heterozygous for previously reported mutations and four novel mutations, E100K, G214R, Q485R and N1245D, were identified. Only four probands fulfilled MODY criteria, with two diagnosed after 25 years and one patient, who had no family history of diabetes, as a result of a proven de novo mutation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ABCC8 mutations can cause MODY in patients whose clinical features are similar to those with HNF1A/4A MODY. Therefore, sequencing of ABCC8 in addition to the known MODY genes should be considered if such features are present, to facilitate optimal clinical management of these patients.

22060211|t|Comprehensive molecular analysis of Japanese patients with pediatric-onset MODY-type diabetes mellitus.
22060211|a|BACKGROUND: In Asians, mutations in the known maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes have been identified in only &lt;15% of patients. These results were obtained mostly through studies on adult patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular basis of Japanese patients with pediatric-onset MODY-type diabetes. SUBJECTS: Eighty Japanese patients with pediatric-onset MODY-type diabetes. METHODS: Mitochondrial 3243A&gt;G mutation was first tested by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for maternally inherited families. Then, all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the HNF1A, HNF1B, GCK, and HNF4A genes were amplified from genomic DNA and directly sequenced. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis was also performed to detect whole-exon deletions. RESULTS: After excluding one patient with a mitochondrial 3243A&gt;G, mutations were identified in 38 (48.1%) patients; 18 had GCK mutations, 11 had HNF1A mutations, 3 had HNF4A mutations, and 6 had HNF1B mutations. In patients aged &lt;8 yr, mutations were detected mostly in GCK at a higher frequency (63.6%). In patients &gt;9 yr of age, mutations were identified less frequently (45.1%), with HNF1A mutations being the most frequent. A large fraction of mutation-negative patients showed elevated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) insulin-resistance and normal HOMA-beta indices. Most of the HNF1B mutations were large deletions, and, interestingly, renal cysts were undetectable in two patients with whole-gene deletion of HNF1B. CONCLUSION: In Japanese patients with pediatric-onset MODY-type diabetes, mutations in known genes were identified at a much higher frequency than previously reported for adult Asians. A fraction of mutation-negative patients presented with insulin-resistance and normal insulin-secretory capacities resembling early-onset type 2 diabetes.
