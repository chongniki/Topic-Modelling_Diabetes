22152955|t|Genetic susceptibility to coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes: 3 independent studies.
22152955|a|OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether coronary heart disease (CHD)-susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies of the general population also contribute to CHD in type 2 diabetes. BACKGROUND: No study has examined the effects of these genetic variants on CHD in diabetic patients. METHODS: We genotyped 15 genetic markers of 12 loci in 3 studies of diabetic patients: the prospective Nurses' Health Study (309 CHD cases, and 544 control subjects) and Health Professional Follow-up Study (345 CHD cases, and 451 control subjects) and the cross-sectional Joslin Heart Study (422 CHD cases, and 435 control subjects). RESULTS: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs4977574 (CDKN2A/2B), rs12526453 (PHACTR1), rs646776 (CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1), rs2259816 (HNF1A), and rs11206510 (PCSK9) showed directionally consistent associations with CHD in the 3 studies, with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.17 to 1.25 (p = 0.03 to 0.0002). None of the other single-nucleotide polymorphisms reached significance in individual or combined analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created by combining the risk alleles of the 5 significantly associated loci. The OR of CHD/GRS unit was 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 1.26; p &lt; 0.0001). Individuals with GRS &gt;=8 (19% of diabetic subjects) had almost a 2-fold increase in CHD risk (OR: 1.94, 95% confidence interval: 1.60 to 2.35) as compared with individuals with GRS &lt;=5 (30% of diabetic subjects). Prediction of CHD was significantly improved (p &lt; 0.001) when the GRS was added to a model including clinical predictors in the combined samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the consistency and differences in the determinants of genetic susceptibility to CHD in diabetic patients and the general populations.

22341299|t|Clinical assessment of HNF1A and GCK variants and identification of a novel mutation causing MODY2.
22341299|a|A child with impaired fasting glucose was found to be heterozygous for a novel variant at c.659G&gt;A in GCK and a variant at c.1663C&gt;T in HNF1A. Structural modeling and clinical correlation suggests that the GCK variant causes monogenic diabetes while the variant in HNF1A is unlikely to be pathogenic.

22350134|t|Cystatin C is not a good candidate biomarker for HNF1A-MODY.
22350134|a|Cystatin C is a marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Its level is influenced, among the others, by CRP whose concentration is decreased in HNF1A-MODY. We hypothesized that cystatin C level might be altered in HNF1A-MODY. We aimed to evaluate cystatin C in HNF1A-MODY both as a diagnostic marker and as a method of assessing GFR. We initially examined 51 HNF1A-MODY patients, 56 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), 39 with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 43 non-diabetic individuals (ND) from Poland. Subjects from two UK centres were used as replication panels: including 215 HNF1A-MODY, 203 T2DM, 39 HNF4A-MODY, 170 GCK-MODY, 17 HNF1B-MODY and 58 T1DM patients. The data were analysed with additive models, adjusting for gender, age, BMI and estimated GFR (creatinine). In the Polish subjects, adjusted cystatin C level in HNF1A-MODY was lower compared with T1DM, T2DM and ND (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, cystatin C-based GFR was higher than that calculated from creatinine level (p &lt; 0.0001) in HNF1A-MODY, while the two GFR estimates were similar or cystatin C-based lower in the other groups. In the UK subjects, there were no differences in cystatin C between HNF1A-MODY and the other diabetic subgroups, except HNF1B-MODY. In UK HNF1A-MODY, cystatin C-based GFR estimate was higher than the creatinine-based one (p &lt; 0.0001). Concluding, we could not confirm our hypothesis (supported by the Polish results) that cystatin C level is altered by HNF1A mutations; thus, it cannot be used as a biomarker for HNF1A-MODY. In HNF1A-MODY, the cystatin C-based GFR estimate is higher than the creatinine-based one.

22360925|t|Lipoprotein composition in HNF1A-MODY: differentiating between HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes.
22360925|a|INTRODUCTION: The young-onset diabetes seen in HNF1A-MODY is often misdiagnosed as Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike HNF1A-MODY, is associated with insulin resistance and a characteristic dyslipidaemia. We aimed to compare the lipid profiles in HNF1A-MODY, Type 2 diabetes and control subjects and to determine if lipids can be used to aid the differential diagnosis of diabetes sub-type. METHODS: 1) 14 subjects in each group (HNF1A-MODY, Type 2 diabetes and controls) were matched for gender and BMI. Fasting lipid profiles and HDL lipid constituents were compared in the 3 groups. 2) HDL-cholesterol was assessed in a further 267 patients with HNF1A-MODY and 297 patients with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes to determine its discriminative value. RESULTS: 1) In HNF1A-MODY subjects, plasma-triglycerides were lower (1.36 vs. 1.93 mmol/l, p = 0.07) and plasma-HDL-cholesterol was higher than in subjects with Type 2 diabetes (1.47 vs. 1.15 mmol/l, p = 0.0008), but was similar to controls. Furthermore, in the isolated HDL; HDL-phospholipid and HDL-cholesterol ester content were higher in HNF1A-MODY, than in Type 2 diabetes (1.59 vs. 1.33 mmol/L, p = 0.04 and 1.10 vs. 0.83 mmol/L, p = 0.019, respectively), but were similar to controls (1.59 vs. 1.45 mmol/L, p = 0.35 and 1.10 vs. 1.21 mmol/L, p = 0.19, respectively). 2) A plasma-HDL-cholesterol &gt; 1.12 mmol/L was 75% sensitive and 64% specific (ROC AUC = 0.76) at discriminating HNF1A-MODY from Type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The plasma-lipid profiles of HNF1A-MODY and the lipid constituents of HDL are similar to non-diabetic controls. However, HDL-cholesterol was higher in HNF1A-MODY than in Type 2 diabetes and could be used as a biomarker to aid in the identification of patients with HNF1A-MODY.

22432108|t|Systematic assessment of etiology in adults with a clinical diagnosis of young-onset type 2 diabetes is a successful strategy for identifying maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
22432108|a|OBJECTIVE: Misdiagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) remains widespread, despite the benefits of optimized management. This cross-sectional study examined diagnostic misclassification of MODY in subjects with clinically labeled young adult-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes by extending genetic testing beyond current guidelines. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals were selected for diagnostic sequencing if they displayed features atypical for their diagnostic label. From 247 case subjects with clinically labeled type 1 diabetes, we sequenced hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) in 20 with residual beta-cell function &gt;= 3 years from diagnosis (random or glucagon-stimulated C-peptide &gt;= 0.2 nmol/L). From 322 with clinically labeled type 2 diabetes, we sequenced HNF1A and HNF4A in 80 with diabetes diagnosed &lt;= 30 years and/or diabetes diagnosed &lt;= 45 years without metabolic syndrome. We also sequenced the glucokinase (GCK) in 40 subjects with mild fasting hyperglycemia. RESULTS: In the type 1 diabetic group, two HNF1A mutations were found (0.8% prevalence). In type 2 diabetic subjects, 10 HNF1A, two HNF4A, and one GCK mutation were identified (4.0%). Only 47% of MODY case subjects identified met current guidelines for diagnostic sequencing. Follow-up revealed a further 12 mutation carriers among relatives. Twenty-seven percent of newly identified MODY subjects changed treatment, all with improved glycemic control (HbA(1c) 8.8 vs. 7.3% at 3 months; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of widened diagnostic testing criteria doubled the numbers of MODY case subjects identified compared with current clinical practice. The yield was greatest in young adult-onset type 2 diabetes. We recommend that all patients diagnosed before age 30 and with presence of C-peptide at 3 years' duration are considered for molecular diagnostic analysis.

22432796|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young: clinical characteristics and outcome after kidney and pancreas transplantation in MODY3 and RCAD patients: a single center experience.
22432796|a|The diabetes and renal phenotype of patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) on a transplantation waiting list is not known; neither is their outcome after pancreas (PT) and/or kidney transplantation (KT). Between 2002 and 2009, we screened 50 of 150 patients referred for kidney and pancreas transplantation to the Kremlin-Bicetre center for HNF1B and HNF1A mutations if one or more of the following criteria was present (i) an atypical history of diabetes (ii) diabetes with at least one affected parent or two affected relatives, (iii) an absence of auto-antibodies at diagnosis (iv) a persistent secretion of fasting C peptide (v) a personal or a family history of renal cysts or dysplasia. Their phenotype and their outcome were analyzed. Four HNF1A (MODY3) and eight HNF1B mutations [renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD)] were identified. All MODY3 patients had diabetic nephropathy, but only 50% of RCAD patients. Four patients underwent a kidney and pancreas transplantation and two a kidney transplant alone. After 4.1 +- 1.1 years of follow-up, 83% of patients still have a functioning kidney and 75% a functioning pancreas. PT can be proposed with good results for MODY3 and RCAD patients.

22463974|t|European genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes in North African Arabs.
22463974|a|AIMS: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and previous approaches have identified many genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in populations of European descent, but their contribution in Arab populations from North Africa is unknown. Our study aimed to validate these markers and to assess their combined effects, using large case-control studies of Moroccan and Tunisian individuals. METHODS: Overall, 44 polymorphisms, located at 37 validated European loci, were first analyzed in 1055 normoglycaemic controls and 1193 T2D cases from Morocco. Associations and trends were then assessed in 942 normoglycaemic controls and 1446 T2D cases from Tunisia. Finally, their ability to discriminate cases from controls was evaluated. RESULTS: Carrying a genetic variant in BCL11A, ADAMTS9, IGF2BP2, WFS1, CDKAL1, TP53INP1, CDKN2A/B, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, HNF1A, FTO, MC4R and GCK increased the risk of T2D when assessing the Moroccan and Tunisian samples together. Each additional risk allele increased the susceptibility for developing the disease by 12% (P = 9.0 x 10(-9)). Genotype information for 13 polymorphisms slightly improved the classification of North Africans with and without T2D, as assessed by clinical parameters, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.64 to 0.67 (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In addition to TCF7L2, 12 additional loci were found to be shared between Europeans and North African Arabs. As for Europeans, the reliability of genetic testing based on these markers to determine the risk for T2D is low. More genome-wide studies, including next-generation sequencing, in North African populations are needed to identify the genetic variants responsible for ethnic disparities in T2D susceptibility.

22591707|t|Genetic prediction of postpartum diabetes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
22591707|a|AIMS: To examine whether genetic variants that predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes (T2D) could predict the development of diabetes after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: 13 SNPs (FTO rs8050136, CDKAL1 rs7754840 and rs7756992, CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, HHEX rs1111875, IGF2BP2 rs1470579 and rs4402960, SLC30A8 rs13266634, TCF7L2 rs7903146, PPARG rs1801282, GCK rs1799884, HNF1A rs1169288, and KCNJ11 rs5219) were genotyped in 793 women with GDM after a median follow-up of 57 months. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and ethnicity, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 and the FTO rs8050136 variants significantly predicted postpartum diabetes; hazard ratio (95% confidence interval 1.29 (1.01-1.66) and 1.36 (1.06-1.74), respectively (additive model) versus 1.45 (1.01-2.08) and 1.56 (1.06-2.29) (dominant model)). Adjusting for BMI attenuated the effect of the FTO variant, suggesting that the effect was mediated through its effect on BMI. Combining all risk alleles to a weighted risk score was significantly associated with the risk of postpartum diabetes (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.18, p=0.00016 after adjustment for age and ethnicity). CONCLUSIONS: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 and FTO rs8050136 polymorphisms, and particularly a weighted risk score of T2D risk alleles, predict diabetes after GDM. Further studies in other populations are needed to confirm our results.

22643178|t|A novel missense mutation in the signal peptide of the human POMC gene: a possible additional link between early-onset type 2 diabetes and obesity.
22643178|a|Rare mutations in several genes have a critical role in the control of homeostatic mechanisms such as food-intake, energy balance and glucose metabolism. In this study, we performed a mutational screening in a 58-year-old woman presenting early-onset type 2 diabetes and central obesity. The entire coding regions of MC4R, MC3R, HNF1A, GCK and POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) genes were analyzed by direct sequencing. A new missense mutation was identified within the POMC gene signal peptide sequence, resulting in a heterozygous substitution of an arginine for a glycine at codon 15 (p.A15G) that was excluded in 300 healthy normal weight controls. The mutation segregated in the family and was associated with overweight, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease in the carriers. Functional studies demonstrated that POMC protein was not detectable in beta-TC3 cells transfected with A15G-POMC vector as well as in their culture media, despite POMC mRNA levels were comparable for amount and stability to those of wild-type-transfected cells. In silico RNA folding prediction indicated that the mutation gives rise to a different RNA secondary structure, suggesting that it might affect translation and protein synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report addressing the functional consequences of a mutation in the signal peptide of POMC. These findings further support the hypothesis that POMC-derived peptides might have a role in the control of peripheral glucose metabolism and suggest that disruption of central POMC secretion might represent an additional link between type 2 diabetes and obesity.

22672869|t|Early onset of liver steatosis in a Japanese girl with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3).
22672869|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the HNF1A gene. Liver adenomatosis has been reported in MODY3 patients. The patient reported in this paper is a Japanese girl who first developed hepatomegaly, fatty liver, and hepatic dysfunction at age 5 years. Liver biopsy demonstrated steatosis and degeneration of hepatocytes. At that time, blood glucose and HbA1c levels were within normal ranges. Elevated HbA1c was noticed 4 years later, but islet cell and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were not detected in the serum. Therefore, MODY3 was suspected and subsequent analysis of the HNF1A gene identified a heterozygous germline splice donor-site mutation in intron 9.  MODY3 patients should be screened by non-invasive liver imaging, and careful follow-up of liver disease should be performed.

22787179|t|Using highly sensitive C-reactive protein measurement to diagnose MODY in a family with suspected type 2 diabetes.
22787179|a|The authors report an adolescent who was found to have diabetes on routine blood testing. The initial diagnosis was type 2 diabetes because she was obese, did not have type 1 diabetes antibodies and both parents had diabetes. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was low in the proband and her father (&lt;=0.1 mg/l) indicating that type 2 diabetes was unlikely, and that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha-maturity onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) was the most likely diagnosis. Following a genetic diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY in the proband and her father, both patients were treated with gliclazide, with improvement in HbA1c. This case highlights the challenges of making a correct diagnosis of MODY in young onset diabetes. The authors report the first case where hsCRP, an easily available biomarker, has been used on an individual level to determine appropriate genetic testing of MODY in a family whose main differential diagnosis was familial type 2 diabetes.

22802087|t|Novel presentations of congenital hyperinsulinism due to mutations in the MODY genes: HNF1A and HNF4A.
22802087|a|CONTEXT: Inactivating mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A cause the maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY)-3 and MODY1 forms of monogenic diabetes, respectively. Children carrying HNF4A (MODY1) mutations can present in early infancy with macrosomia and diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe three novel cases of hyperinsulinism associated with MODY1 and MODY3 mutations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from chart review. Gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA. RESULTS: Case 1 was diagnosed at 20 months with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A mutation, carried by her father who had diabetes. Case 2 was diagnosed with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism at 3 months of age and had complete resolution of hyperinsulinism by 4 yr. She was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A missense mutation, also carried by her father. Case 3 presented as a newborn with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism and later developed renal Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, and hepatic glycogenosis. Although the latter's features suggested Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, sequencing of the SLC2A2 gene was normal. The patient was found to have a known MODY1 mutation in HNF4A. In all cases, the hyperinsulinism improved with age. CONCLUSIONS: The first two cases demonstrate that mutations in HNF1A (MODY3) can cause hyperinsulinism early in life and diabetes later, similar to the phenotype recently reported for HNF4A (MODY1) mutations. Case 3 indicates that the effects of HNF4A mutations in infancy may extend beyond pancreatic beta-cells to produce a disorder similar to glucose transporter 2 deficiency involving both liver glycogen metabolism and renal tubular transport.

22808921|t|Serum levels of pancreatic stone protein (PSP)/reg1A as an indicator of beta-cell apoptosis suggest an increased apoptosis rate in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A-MODY) carriers from the third decade of life onward.
22808921|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha (HNF1A) result in the commonest type of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). HNF1A-MODY carriers have reduced pancreatic beta cell mass, partially due to an increased rate of apoptosis. To date, it has not been possible to determine when apoptosis is occurring in HNF1A-MODY.We have recently demonstrated that beta cell apoptosis stimulates the expression of the pancreatic stone protein/regenerating (PSP/reg) gene in surviving neighbour cells, and that PSP/reg1A protein is subsequently secreted from these cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether serum levels of PSP/reg1A are elevated during disease progression in HNF1A-MODY carriers, and whether it may provide information regarding the onset of beta-cell apoptosis. METHODS: We analysed serum PSP/reg1A levels and correlated with clinical and biochemical parameters in subjects with HNF1A-MODY, glucokinase (GCK-MODY), and type 1 diabetes mellitus. A control group of normoglycaemic subjects was also analysed. RESULTS: PSP/reg1A serum levels were significantly elevated in HNF1A-MODY (n = 37) subjects compared to controls (n = 60) (median = 12.50 ng/ml, IQR = 10.61-17.87 ng/ml versus median = 10.72 ng/ml, IQR = 8.94-12.54 ng/ml, p = 0.0008). PSP/reg1A correlated negatively with insulin levels during OGTT, (rho = -0.40, p = 0.02). Interestingly we noted a significant positive correlation of PSP/reg1A with age of the HNF1A-MODY carriers (rho = 0.40 p = 0.02) with an age of 25 years separating carriers with low and high PSP/reg1A levels. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus also had elevated serum levels of PSP/reg1A compared to controls, however this was independent of the duration of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that beta cell apoptosis contributes increasingly to the pathophysiology of HNF1A-MODY in patients 25 years and over. PSP/reg1A may be developed as a serum marker to detect increased beta-cell apoptosis, or its therapeutic response.

22849862|t|Genetic and functional analyses of MRAS and HNF1A genes in diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.
22849862|a|Evidence has recently indicated that the           MRAS and HNF1A genetic polymorphisms are associated           with coronary artery disease. The MRAS           and HNF1A genes are located on chromosomes 3q           and 12q within the regions where associations with           diabetes and diabetic nephropathy occur. We thus           performed genetic and functional analyses of these           two genes to evaluate their impacts on diabetes and           diabetic nephropathy. MRAS and HNF1A genetic           polymorphisms were genotyped in 1399 Czech subjects           including non-diabetic controls (339), type 1           (243) and type 2 (817) diabetic patients with and           without diabetic nephropathy using TaqMan allelic           discrimination. Gene expression levels in the kidneys           of diabetic Goto-Kakizaki and Wistar rats were detected           with real-time RT-PCR. Despite no significance           in genetic analysis of diabetic subjects, SNP           rs2259816 in the HNF1A gene tended to associate with diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetic patients.           The hnf1a gene expression was significantly decreased           in kidney tissues of Goto-Kakizaki rats compared           to Wistar and insulin-treated Goto-Kakizaki           rats. There was neither significant association in the           MRAS genetic polymorphism with diabetic nephropathy           nor variation of mras gene expression in the kidneys           of Goto-Kakizaki and Wistar rats. Data from           the present study have not proved any significant association           of the MRAS and HNF1A genetic polymorphisms           with diabetes and diabetic nephropathy in a           cohort of Czech population. However, the functional           analysis and the trend in genetic analysis suggest           that the HNF1A gene may have primary genetic impact           on the development of diabetic nephropathy.

22859960|t|Metabolic profiling in Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and young onset type 2 diabetes fails to detect robust urinary biomarkers.
22859960|a|It is important to identify patients with Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) as a molecular diagnosis determines both treatment and prognosis. Genetic testing is currently expensive and many patients are therefore not assessed and are misclassified as having either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Biomarkers could facilitate the prioritisation of patients for genetic testing. We hypothesised that patients with different underlying genetic aetiologies for their diabetes could have distinct metabolic profiles which may uncover novel biomarkers. The aim of this study was to perform metabolic profiling in urine from patients with MODY due to mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase (GCK) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and normoglycaemic control subjects. Urinary metabolic profiling by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and ultra performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was performed in a Discovery set of subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 14), GCK-MODY (n = 17), T2D (n = 14) and normoglycaemic controls (n = 34). Data were used to build a valid partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) model where HNF1A-MODY subjects could be separated from the other diabetes subtypes. No single metabolite contributed significantly to the separation of the patient groups. However, betaine, valine, glycine and glucose were elevated in the urine of HNF1A-MODY subjects compared to the other subgroups. Direct measurements of urinary amino acids and betaine in an extended dataset did not support differences between patients groups. Elevated urinary glucose in HNF1A-MODY is consistent with the previously reported low renal threshold for glucose in this genetic subtype. In conclusion, we report the first metabolic profiling study in monogenic diabetes and show that, despite the distinct biochemical pathways affected, there are unlikely to be robust urinary biomarkers which distinguish monogenic subtypes from T2D. Our results have implications for studies investigating metabolic profiles in complex traits including T2D.

22877752|t|Identification of hepatocyte growth factor activator (Hgfac) gene as a target of HNF1alpha in mouse beta-cells.
22877752|a|HNF1alpha is a transcription factor that is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells and mutations of the HNF1alpha gene cause a form of monogenic diabetes. To understand the role of HNF1alpha in pancreatic beta-cells, we established the MIN6 beta-cell line that stably expressed HNF1alpha-specific shRNA. Expression of the gene encoding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator (Hgfac), a serine protease that efficiently activates HGF, was decreased in HNF1alpha KD-MIN6 cells. Down-regulation of Hgfac expression was also found in the islets of HNF1alpha (+/-) mice. Reporter gene analysis and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that HNF1alpha directly regulates the expression of Hgfac in beta-cells. It has been reported that HGF has an important influence on beta-cell mass and beta-cell function. Thus, HNF1alpha might regulate beta-cell mass or function at least partly by modulating Hgfac expression.

23009393|t|Co-inheritance of HNF1a and GCK mutations in a family with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY): implications for genetic testing.
23009393|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the genetic basis of dominant early-onset diabetes mellitus in two families. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Molecular analysis by PCR sequencing of the promoter, the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and exons of both GCK and HNF1A genes was carried out in two families with clinically diagnosed dominant diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The novel HNF1A c.-154_-160TGGGGGT mutation, located in the 5' UTR, was present in several members of the two families in the heterozygous state. Interestingly, the GCK p.Y61X mutation was also identified in three members of one of the families, and two of them carried both mutations in heterozygosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the co-inheritance of GCK and HNF1A mutations and the coexistence of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2, MODY 3 and unusual MODY 2-3 genotypes in the same family. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of both GCK and HNF1A mutations manifested a typical MODY 3 phenotype and showed that the presence of a second mutation in the GCK gene apparently did not modify the clinical outcome, at least at the time of this study. Our data show that co-inheritance of MODY 2 and MODY 3 mutations should be considered, at least in some cases, for accurate genetic testing.

23052196|t|Inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 and 4 alpha (HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha) as a mechanism of arsenic carcinogenesis.
23052196|a|Inorganic arsenic (i-As) is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid affecting millions of people worldwide. It is known to be carcinogen, liver being a potential target, and related to the prevalence of diabetes in arseniasis-endemic areas. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 and 4 alpha (HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha) are key members of a transcriptional network essential for normal liver architecture. Changes in HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha expression are clearly associated with the development of liver malignancies and diabetes in humans. In this work, hepatic HepG2 cells and golden Syrian hamsters were exposed to sub-toxic, environmentally relevant doses of sodium arsenite (SA; up to 10 muM in vitro, 15 mg/L in vivo) in order to evaluate whether arsenic is able to compromise the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factors. Also, liver histopathological examination was carried out, and several markers of hepatocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism status were determined as a measure of i-As-induced effects. Results show a consistent down-regulation of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha under a scenario of exposure where HepG2 cells (1) gained resistance to arsenic-induced toxicity/apoptosis, (2) attained loss of tissue-specific features (as shown by the observed down-regulation of ALDOB, PEPCK and CYP1A2, triggering of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and the hypersecretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9), (3) failed to maintain balanced expression of the "stemness" genes C-MYC, OCT3/4, LIN28 and NOTCH2 and (4) showed glucose metabolism impairment. We conclude that the i-As-induced down-regulation of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha under chronic settings may play a central role in the features of disease and cancer observed both in vivo and in vitro.

23139355|t|Metabolite profiling reveals normal metabolic control in carriers of mutations in the glucokinase gene (MODY2).
23139355|a|Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase (GCK) cause a mild hereditary form of diabetes termed maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)2 or GCK-MODY. The disease does not progress over time, and diabetes complications rarely develop. It has therefore been suggested that GCK-MODY represents a metabolically compensated condition, but experimental support for this notion is lacking. Here, we profiled metabolites in serum from patients with MODY1 (HNF4A), MODY2 (GCK), MODY3 (HNF1A), and type 2 diabetes and from healthy individuals to characterize metabolic perturbations caused by specific mutations. Analysis of four GCK-MODY patients revealed a metabolite pattern similar to that of healthy individuals, while other forms of diabetes differed markedly in their metabolite profiles. Furthermore, despite elevated glucose concentrations, carriers of GCK mutations showed lower levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides than healthy control subjects. The metabolite profiling was confirmed by enzymatic assays and replicated in a cohort of 11 GCK-MODY patients. Elevated levels of fatty acids are known to associate with beta-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased incidence of late complications. Our results show that GCK-MODY represents a metabolically normal condition, which may contribute to the lack of late complications and the nonprogressive nature of the disease.

23157689|t|Apolipoprotein M can discriminate HNF1A-MODY from Type 1 diabetes.
23157689|a|AIMS: Missed diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has led to an interest in biomarkers that enable efficient prioritization of patients for definitive molecular testing. Apolipoprotein M (apoM) was suggested as a biomarker for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY because of its reduced expression in Hnf1a(-/-)  mice. However, subsequent human studies examining apoM as a biomarker have yielded conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate apoM as a biomarker for HNF1A-MODY using a highly specific and sensitive ELISA. METHODS: ApoM concentration was measured in subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 69), Type 1 diabetes (n = 50), Type 2 diabetes (n = 120) and healthy control subjects (n = 100). The discriminative accuracy of apoM and of the apoM/HDL ratio for diabetes aetiology was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) serum apoM concentration (mumol/l) was significantly lower for subjects with HNF1A-MODY [0.86 (0.29)], than for those with Type 1 diabetes [1.37 (0.26), P = 3.1 x 10(-18) ) and control subjects [1.34 (0.22), P = 7.2 x 10(-19) ). There was no significant difference in apoM concentration between subjects with HNF1A-MODY and Type 2 diabetes [0.89 (0.28), P = 0.13]. The C-statistic measure of discriminative accuracy for apoM was 0.91 for HNF1A-MODY vs. Type 1 diabetes, indicating high discriminative accuracy. The apoM/HDL ratio was significantly lower in HNF1A-MODY than other study groups. However, this ratio did not perform well in discriminating HNF1A-MODY from either Type 1 diabetes (C-statistic = 0.79) or Type 2 diabetes (C-statistic = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm an earlier report that serum apoM levels are lower in HNF1A-MODY than in controls. Serum apoM provides good discrimination between HNF1A-MODY and Type 1 diabetes and warrants further investigation for clinical utility in diabetes diagnostics.

23183503|t|Variants within HNF1alpha and ANGPTL4 genes and acute coronary syndrome in Czech population. The GENDEMIP study.
23183503|a|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a complex arterial disease involving interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors. A large number of genetic polymorphisms associated with atherosclerotic diseases have been identified in recent years. We investigated the possible association between hepatic nuclear factor (HNF1-alpha) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) single nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the Czech population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,182 patients with ACS (835 males and 347 females) and 1,200 healthy controls (827 males and 373 females) were included in the study. All patients were younger than 65 years of age. rs7310409 (A&gt;G within the HNF1-alpha gene) and rs116843064 (G&gt;A within the ANGPTL4 gene) were genotyped using TaqMan genotyping assays. RESULTS: The frequencies of the genotypes in patients with ACS did not significantly differ from the control group for the rs7310409 polymorphism (AA=17.1%, AG=46.6%, GG=36.2% vs. AA=14.4%, AG=50.3%, GG=35.3%, respectively; p=0.12) or the rs116843064 polymorphism (AA=0.1%, AG=3.5%, GG=96.4% vs. AA=0.1%, AG=4.2%, GG=95.7%, respectively; p=0.69). There was no interaction with gender. In addition, gene variants were not associated with common cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity and diabetes). CONCLUSIONS: No association was observed between polymorphisms within the HNF1-alpha and ANGPTL4 genes and the risk of ACS in the Czech population.

23247789|t|Familial early-onset diabetes is not a typical MODY in several Tunisian patients.
23247789|a|BACKGROUND: MODY (Maturity-onset diabetes of the young), a dominantly inherited form of early-onset diabetes, is clinically and genetically heterogeneous with more than ten genetic subtypes described worldwide. AIM: To evaluate the possible existence of MODY in 12 young diabetic Tunisian patients by searching for mutations in the most prevalent MODY genes. METHODS: Twelve patients with diabetes in 2-to-3 generations, all diagnosed before age 31, were screened for mutations and deletions in HNF1A, HNF4A, INS, IPF1, NEUROD1 and GCK genes by Sanger sequencing and by Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. RESULTS: The patients had no evidence of autoimmunity and a mean age at diabetes diagnosis of 25.66 +- 3.96 years with severe overt diabetes (fasting glycaemia: 10.91 +- 3.55 mmol/ l; HbA1c: 10.46 +- 3.31 %). Two subjects were initially treated with insulin. On the ten initially treated with OHA or on diet, eight converted to insulin therapy (within 3 months to 20 years). Molecular analysis showed only one missense HNF4A mutation (I453V) in one family. No mutations in the studied genes were detected in the other patients. CONCLUSION: A molecular defect in known MODY genes has been excluded in 11 patients with early-onset diabetes suggesting that other genetic causes may explain diabetes in these families. In such cases, new generation sequencing approaches may be well appropriate to identify specific molecular etiologies from extended families and to establish a strategy of molecular diagnostic of MODY in Tunisia.

23274891|t|Mutations in HNF1A result in marked alterations of plasma glycan profile.
23274891|a|A recent genome-wide association study identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) as a key regulator of fucosylation. We hypothesized that loss-of-function HNF1A mutations causal for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) would display altered fucosylation of N-linked glycans on plasma proteins and that glycan biomarkers could improve the efficiency of a diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY. In a pilot comparison of 33 subjects with HNF1A-MODY and 41 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 15 of 29 glycan measurements differed between the two groups. The DG9-glycan index, which is the ratio of fucosylated to nonfucosylated triantennary glycans, provided optimum discrimination in the pilot study and was examined further among additional subjects with HNF1A-MODY (n = 188), glucokinase (GCK)-MODY (n = 118), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A)-MODY (n = 40), type 1 diabetes (n = 98), type 2 diabetes (n = 167), and nondiabetic controls (n = 98). The DG9-glycan index was markedly lower in HNF1A-MODY than in controls or other diabetes subtypes, offered good discrimination between HNF1A-MODY and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (C statistic &gt;= 0.90), and enabled us to detect three previously undetected HNF1A mutations in patients with diabetes. In conclusion, glycan profiles are altered substantially in HNF1A-MODY, and the DG9-glycan index has potential clinical value as a diagnostic biomarker of HNF1A dysfunction.

23306198|t|Derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young.
23306198|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant disease. Despite extensive research, the mechanism by which a mutant MODY gene results in monogenic diabetes is not yet clear due to the inaccessibility of patient samples. Induced pluripotency and directed differentiation toward the pancreatic lineage are now viable and attractive methods to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying MODY. Here we report, for the first time, the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients with five types of MODY: MODY1 (HNF4A), MODY2 (GCK), MODY3 (HNF1A), MODY5 (HNF1B), and MODY8 (CEL) with a polycistronic lentiviral vector expressing a Cre-excisable human "stem cell cassette" containing the four reprogramming factors OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and CMYC. These MODY-hiPSCs morphologically resemble human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), express pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60, give rise to derivatives of the three germ layers in a teratoma assay, and are karyotypically normal. Overall, our MODY-hiPSCs serve as invaluable tools to dissect the role of MODY genes in the development of pancreas and islet cells and to evaluate their significance in regulating beta cell function. This knowledge will aid future attempts aimed at deriving functional mature beta cells from hPSCs.

23348805|t|Mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha and 4 alpha in maturity-onset diabetes of the young and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.
23348805|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance of young-onset (typically &lt;25 years), noninsulin-dependent diabetes due to defective insulin secretion. MODY is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous with mutations in at least 10 genes. Mutations in the HNF1A gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha are the most common cause of MODY in most adult populations studied. The number of different pathogenic HNF1A mutations totals 414 in 1,247 families. Mutations in the HNF4A gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha are a rarer cause of MODY with 103 different mutations reported in 173 families to date. Sensitivity to treatment with sulfonylurea tablets is a feature of both HNF1A and HNF4A mutations. The HNF4A MODY phenotype has been expanded by the reports of macrosomia in ~50% of babies, and more rarely, neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The identification of an HNF1A or HNF4A gene mutation has important implications for clinical management in diabetes and pregnancy, but MODY is significantly underdiagnosed. Current research is focused on identifying biomarkers and developing probability models to identify those patients most likely to have MODY, until next generation sequencing technology enables cost-effective gene analysis for all patients with young onset diabetes.

23517481|t|The spectrum of HNF1A gene mutations in Greek patients with MODY3: relative frequency and identification of seven novel germline mutations.
23517481|a|OBJECTIVE: Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is the most common type of monogenic diabetes accounting for 1-2% of the population with diabetes. The relative incidence of HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) is high in European countries; however, data are not available for the Greek population. The aims of this study were to determine the relative frequency of MODY3 in Greece, the type of the mutations observed, and their relation to the phenotype of the patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred ninety-five patients were referred to our center because of suspected MODY during a period of 15 yr. The use of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA revealed 72 patients carrying Glucokinase gene mutations (MODY2) and 8 patients carrying HNF1A gene mutations (MODY3). After using strict criteria, 54 patients were selected to be further evaluated by direct sequencing or by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) for the presence of HNF1A gene mutations. RESULTS: In 16 unrelated patients and 13 of their relatives, 15 mutations were identified in the HNF1A gene. Eight of these mutations were previously reported, whereas seven were novel. Clinical features, such as age of diabetes at diagnosis or severity of hyperglycemia, were not related to the mutation type or location. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients fulfilling strict clinical criteria for MODY, 12% carried an HNF1A gene mutation, suggesting that defects of this gene are responsible for a significant proportion of monogenic diabetes in the Greek population. No clear phenotype-genotype correlations were identified.

23539835|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young: clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management.
23539835|a|Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), represents a rare cause of diabetes (1% of all cases), commonly misdiagnosed as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) or Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Clinical characteristics of MODY include age of onset before 45 years, absence of beta-cell autoimmunity and features of metabolic syndrome, sustained endogenous insulin production and strong family history. Common reasons for misdiagnosis are limitations in physicians' awareness and restrictions in performing genetic testing. In an attempt to improve diagnosis rates, recent research efforts have focused on the discovery of non-genetic biomarkers for prioritising individuals for genetic testing, with some promising progress (identification of high-sensitivity CRP, plasma glycan profile as HNF1A-MODY). The information provided is relevant to physicians dealing with young adults but details on pediatric populations are also included. Raising awareness about MODY and making the diagnosis more accessible will improve prognostication and management of these patients and their relatives.

23548576|t|Should the negativity for islet cell autoantibodies be used in a prescreening for genetic testing in maturity-onset diabetes of the young? The case of autoimmunity-associated destruction of pancreatic beta-cells in a family of HNF1A-MODY subjects.
23548576|a|It was recently suggested that routine islet cell autoantibody testing should be performed to discriminate maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) from type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This is the first report ever to describe the familial manifestation of T1DM autoimmunity in nonobese HNF1A-MODY subjects and the presence of islet antigen-2 (IA-2) antibodies in MODY subjects. Three nonobese subjects in an age range of 14-35 years were diagnosed with HNF1A-MODY (p. Arg159Gln mutation). All the tested subjects had detectable (but varying) levels of islet cell autoantibodies (i.e., antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase or IA-2) in the absence of other T1DM characteristics. They displayed long-term expression of intermediate fasting C-peptide levels, ketoacidosis was absent even in periods of spontaneous insulin withdrawal, and full dependence on externally administered insulin was not detected in any of them although better glycemic control was achieved when insulin was supplemented. The course of the disease was similar to that of the autoantibody-negative HNF1A-MODY subjects. The case questions the selectivity of autoantibodies as a marker of T1DM or late-onset autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) over MODY and challenges the use of autoantibodies as a universal negative marker of MODY in an effort to decrease the cost of health care, as it may eventually lead to the wrong diagnosis and thus to the incorrect treatment. Further research should involve examination of the autoantibody titers and prevalence in large and geographically diverse cohorts of MODY subjects selected for genetic testing (regardless of their autoantibody titers) as well as determination of the islet cell autoantibody kinetics in the course of MODY onset and progression.

23551881|t|Digenic heterozygous HNF1A and HNF4A mutations in two siblings with childhood-onset diabetes.
23551881|a|Monogenic diabetes due to mutations in the transcription factor genes hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) and HNF4A is characterized by islet cell antibody negative, familial diabetes with residual insulin secretion. We report two sisters with childhood onset diabetes who are both heterozygous for the most common mutation in each of two transcription factors, HNF1A, and HNF4A. The proband was diagnosed with diabetes at 7 yr of age and treated with insulin for 4 yr. Her genetic diagnosis resulted in transition to sulfonylureas for one and a half years before insulin therapy was re-initiated due to declining glycemic control. Her sister was diagnosed with diabetes at 14 yr of age, treated initially with insulin but has been well controlled on oral sulfonylurea therapy for over 2 yr. Both sisters inherited the HNF4A gene mutation R127W from their mother and the HNF1A gene mutation P291fsinsC (c.872dup) from their father. The father was diagnosed with diabetes at 45 yr of age. Their brother is heterozygous for the HNF4A R127W mutation. Both the brother and mother have normal glucose tolerance at the ages of 16 and 46 yr, respectively. Digenic inheritance of HNF1A and HNF4A mutations is very rare and has only been reported in two families where conclusive evidence for the pathogenicity of their mutations was lacking. Follow-up studies in this family co-segregating the two most commonly reported HNF1A/HNF4A mutations will be informative for understanding the effect of digenic inheritance upon phenotypic severity and response to sulfonylurea therapy.

23557703|t|Effects of common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits on alpha- and beta-cell function and insulin action in humans.
23557703|a|Although meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies have identified &gt;60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes and/or glycemic traits, there is little information on whether these variants also affect alpha-cell function. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of glycemia-associated genetic loci on islet function in vivo and in vitro. We studied 43 SNPs in 4,654 normoglycemic participants from the Finnish population-based Prevalence, Prediction, and Prevention of Diabetes-Botnia (PPP-Botnia) Study. Islet function was assessed, in vivo, by measuring insulin and glucagon concentrations during oral glucose tolerance test, and, in vitro, by measuring glucose-stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion from human pancreatic islets. Carriers of risk variants in BCL11A, HHEX, ZBED3, HNF1A, IGF1, and NOTCH2 showed elevated whereas those in CRY2, IGF2BP2, TSPAN8, and KCNJ11 showed decreased fasting and/or 2-h glucagon concentrations in vivo. Variants in BCL11A, TSPAN8, and NOTCH2 affected glucagon secretion both in vivo and in vitro. The MTNR1B variant was a clear outlier in the relationship analysis between insulin secretion and action, as well as between insulin, glucose, and glucagon. Many of the genetic variants shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes or glycemic traits also exert pleiotropic in vivo and in vitro effects on islet function.

23610083|t|Two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in HNF1A-MODY linked to severe dehydration: is it time to change the diagnostic criteria for MODY?
23610083|a|OBJECTIVE: Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by heterozygous mutations in HNF1A. Currently, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an exclusion criterion for genetic testing for MODY. HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: In this article, we describe two unrelated patients aged 17 and 24 years with severe DKA developed several years after the diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY. INVESTIGATION: Both patients were treated with insulin, but their metabolic control was poor (HbA1c 15%, 140 mmol/mol and 13%, 119 mmol/mol, respectively) due to noncompliance and missed insulin injections. In both patients, DKA followed a course of recurrent vomiting with dehydration and prerenal acute kidney injury. Their glycemia, blood pH, and base excess at admission were 97 mmol/L [1,748 mg/dL], 6.80, and -33 mmol/L (patient 1) and 34 mmol/L [613 mg/dL], 7.03, and -14 mmol/L (patient 2). CONCLUSIONS: This anecdotal observation supports the notion that a history of DKA does not exclude MODY.

23616187|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young and hepatic adenomatosis - characterisation of a new mutation.
23616187|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) mutations cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 3. Further extending the phenotypic spectrum, HNF1A mutations are associated with hepatic adenomatosis. A 20-year old lean, female patient with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus was negative for diabetes-associated autoantibodies and had no relevant family history. Hepatic adenomatosis was diagnosed. Her HNF1A gene was examined and identified alterations further analysed.Sequencing of her HNF1A gene revealed a previously uncharacterised Q495X nonsense mutation, along with the known A98V polymorphism, both in the heterozygous state. The patient's father was also a carrier of both the mutation and the polymorphism. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed impaired glucose tolerance, whereas imaging of his liver was unremarkable. Wild type HNF1A and HNF1A carrying the Q495X mutation were co-transfected in reporter gene assays. The mutation causes a dominant-negative HNF1A protein variant which blocks HNF1A wild-type-mediated gene expression.The novel Q495X mutation is the likely cause of our patient's diabetes and hepatic adenomatosis. It may also cause her father's impaired glucose tolerance. More generally speaking, if non-autoimmune diabetes is suspected, examination of the liver may provide important diagnostic clues. Furthermore, patients with hepatic adenomatosis without known diabetes should be screened by OGTT. Relatives of patients with HNF1A mutations should also be screened by OGTT to detect potential early-stage diabetes.

23624530|t|Prevalence of monogenic diabetes in the population-based Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry.
23624530|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Monogenic diabetes (MD) might be misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes. The prevalence of MD among children with apparent type 1 diabetes has not been established. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of common forms of MD in childhood diabetes. METHODS: We investigated 2,756 children aged 0-14 years with newly diagnosed diabetes who had been recruited to the nationwide population-based Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry (NCDR), from July 2002 to March 2012. Completeness of ascertainment was 91%. Children diagnosed with diabetes who were under12 months of age were screened for mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS. Children without GAD and protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein antibodies were screened in two ways. Those who had a parent with diabetes were screened for mutations in HNF1A, HNF4A, INS and MT-TL1. Children with HbA1c &lt;7.5% (&lt;58 mmol/mol) and no insulin requirement were screened for mutations in GCK. Finally, we searched the Norwegian MODY Registry for children with genetically verified MD. RESULTS: We identified 15 children harbouring a mutation in HNF1A, nine with one in GCK, four with one in KCNJ11, one child with a mutation in INS and none with a mutation in MT-TL1. The minimum prevalence of MD in the NCDR was therefore 1.1%. By searching the Norwegian MODY Registry, we found 24 children with glucokinase-MODY, 15 of whom were not present in the NCDR. We estimated the minimum prevalence of MD among Norwegian children to be 3.1/100,000. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This is the first prevalence study of the common forms of MD in a nationwide, population-based registry of childhood diabetes. We found that 1.1% of patients in the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry had MD.

23674172|t|Identification of circulating microRNAs in HNF1A-MODY carriers.
23674172|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: HNF1A-MODY is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by mutations in the HNF1A gene. Here we identify, for the first time, HNF1A-MODY-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be detected in the serum of HNF1A-MODY carriers. METHODS: An miRNA array was carried out in rat INS-1 insulinoma cells inducibly expressing the common human Pro291fsinsC-HNF1A frame shift mutation. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of miRNAs in the serum of HNF1A-MODY carriers (n = 31), MODY-negative family members (n = 10) and individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 17) was quantified by absolute real-time PCR analysis. RESULTS: Inducible expression of Pro291fsinsC-HNF1A in INS-1 cells caused a significant upregulation of three miRNAs (miR-103, miR-224, miR-292-3p). The differential expression of two miRNAs (miR-103 and miR-224) was validated in vitro. Strongly elevated levels of miR-103 and miR-224 could be detected in the serum of HNF1A-MODY carriers compared with MODY-negative family controls. Serum levels of miR-103 distinguished HNF1A-MODY carriers from HbA1c-matched individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates that the pathophysiology of HNF1A-MODY is associated with the overexpression of miR-103 and miR-224. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that these miRNAs can be readily detected in the serum of HNF1A-MODY carriers.

23707370|t|Primary hepatocellular neoplasms in a MODY3 family with a novel HNF1A germline mutation.
23707370|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) and hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are associated with mutations in the HNF1A gene. HNF1A codes for the transcription factor HNF1alpha, which interacts with DNA as a homodimer or a heterodimer with HNF1beta, to regulate multiple cellular functions including glucidic metabolism, lipidic transport, and detoxication. We report three members of one family with a novel germline in-frame deletion of HNF1A exons 2-3 identified initially using array CGH and direct sequence analysis. All three family members have MODY3 in association with primary liver cell tumours (HCA, liver adenomatosis (LA), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)). Additionally, a high rate of infant mortality was observed in the family. The described family demonstrates a novel HNF1A mutation associated with both benign and malignant primary liver cell tumours and MODY3.

23771925|t|Prevalence, characteristics and clinical diagnosis of maturity onset diabetes of the young due to mutations in HNF1A, HNF4A, and glucokinase: results from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth.
23771925|a|AIMS: Our study aims were to determine the frequency of MODY mutations (HNF1A, HNF4A, glucokinase) in a diverse population of youth with diabetes and to assess how well clinical features identify youth with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). METHODS: The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is a US multicenter, population-based study of youth with diabetes diagnosed at age younger than 20 years. We sequenced genomic DNA for mutations in the HNF1A, HNF4A, and glucokinase genes in 586 participants enrolled in SEARCH between 2001 and 2006. Selection criteria included diabetes autoantibody negativity and fasting C-peptide levels of 0.8 ng/mL or greater. RESULTS: We identified a mutation in one of three MODY genes in 47 participants, or 8.0% of the tested sample, for a prevalence of at least 1.2% in the pediatric diabetes population. Of these, only 3 had a clinical diagnosis of MODY, and the majority was treated with insulin. Compared with the MODY-negative group, MODY-positive participants had lower FCP levels (2.2 +- 1.4 vs 3.2 +- 2.1 ng/mL, P &lt; .01) and fewer type 2 diabetes-like metabolic features. Parental history of diabetes did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this systematic study of MODY in a large pediatric US diabetes cohort, unselected by referral pattern or family history, MODY was usually misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated with insulin. Although many type 2 diabetes-like metabolic features were less common in the mutation-positive group, no single characteristic identified all patients with mutations. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of MODY diagnosis, particularly in antibody-negative youth with diabetes.

23793674|a|OBJECTIVES: To describe the development process for defining an appropriate model structure for the economic evaluation of test-treatment strategies for patients with monogenic diabetes (caused by mutations in the GCK, HNF1A or HNF4A genes). DESIGN: Experts were consulted to identify and define realistic test-treatment strategies and care pathways. A systematic assessment of published diabetes models was undertaken to inform the model structure. SETTING: National Health Service in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Experts in monogenic diabetes whose collective expertise spans the length of the patient care pathway. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: A defined model structure, including the test-treatment strategies, and the selection of a published diabetes model appropriate for the economic evaluation of strategies to identify patients with monogenic diabetes. RESULTS: Five monogenic diabetes test-treatment strategies were defined: no testing of any kind, referral for genetic testing based on clinical features as noted by clinicians, referral for genetic testing based on the results of a clinical prediction model, referral for genetic testing based on the results of biochemical and immunological tests, referral for genetic testing for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes under the age of 30 years. The systematic assessment of diabetes models identified the IMS CORE Diabetes Model (IMS CDM) as a good candidate for modelling the long-term outcomes and costs of the test-treatment strategies for monogenic diabetes. The short-term test-treatment events will be modelled using a decision tree which will feed into the IMS CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a model structure for any economic evaluation requires decisions to be made. Expert consultation and the explicit use of critical appraisal can inform these decisions. Although arbitrary choices have still been made, decision modelling allows investigation into such choices and the impact of assumptions that have to be made due to a lack of data.

23803251|t|Effects of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A and -4A on pancreatic stone protein/regenerating protein and C-reactive protein gene expression: implications for maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
23803251|a|BACKGROUND: There is a significant clinical overlap between patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1A and HNF4A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), two forms of monogenic diabetes. HNF1A and HNF4A are transcription factors that control common and partly overlapping sets of target genes. We have previously shown that elevated serum pancreatic stone protein / regenerating protein A (PSP/reg1A) levels can be detected in subjects with HNF1A-MODY. In this study, we investigated whether PSP/reg is differentially regulated by HNF1A and HNF4A. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting were used to validate gene and protein expression in cellular models of HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY. Serum PSP/reg1A levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by ELISA in 31 HNF1A- and 9 HNF4A-MODY subjects. The two groups were matched for age, body mass index, diabetes duration, blood pressure, lipid profile and aspirin and statin use. RESULTS: Inducible repression of HNF1A and HNF4A function in INS-1 cells suggested that PSP/reg induction required HNF4A, but not HNF1A. In contrast, crp gene expression was significantly reduced by repression of HNF1A, but not HNF4A function. PSP/reg levels were significantly lower in HNF4A subjects when compared to HNF1A subjects [9.25 (7.85-12.85) ng/ml vs. 12.5 (10.61-17.87) ng/ml, U-test P = 0.025]. hsCRP levels were significantly lower in HNF1A-MODY [0.22 (0.17-0.35) mg/L] compared to HNF4A-MODY group [0.81 (0.38-1.41) mg/L, U-test P = 0.002], Parallel measurements of serum PSP/reg1A and hsCRP levels were able to discriminate HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY subjects. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that two distinct target genes, PSP/reg and crp, are differentially regulated by HNF1A and HNF4A, and provides clinical proof-of-concept that serum PSP/reg1A and hsCRP levels may distinguish HNF1A-MODY from HNF4A-MODY subjects.

23878349|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young: identification and diagnosis.
23878349|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic disorder that results in a familial, young-onset non-insulin dependent form of diabetes, typically presenting in lean young adults before 25 years. Approximately 1% of diabetes has a monogenic cause but this is frequently misdiagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. A correct genetic diagnosis is important as it often leads to improved treatment for those affected with diabetes and enables predictive genetic testing for their asymptomatic relatives. An early diagnosis together with appropriate treatment is essential for reducing the risk of diabetic complications in later life. Mutations in the GCK and HNF1A/4 A genes account for up to 80% of all MODY cases. Mutations in the GCK gene cause a mild, asymptomatic and non-progressive fasting hyperglycaemia from birth usually requiring no treatment. In contrast, mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factors HNF1A and HNF4A cause a progressive insulin secretory defect and hyperglycaemia that can lead to vascular complications. The diabetes in these patients is usually well controlled with sulphonylurea tablets although insulin treatment may be required in later life. In this review, we outline the key clinical and laboratory characteristics of the common and rarer causes of MODY with the aim of raising awareness of this condition amongst health-care scientists.

23979397|t|Production of diabetic offspring using cryopreserved epididymal sperm by in vitro fertilization and intrafallopian insemination techniques in transgenic pigs.
23979397|a|Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a useful technique for creating pig strains that model human diseases. However, production of numerous cloned disease model pigs by SCNT for large-scale experiments is impractical due to its complexity and inefficiency. In the present study, we aimed to establish an efficient procedure for proliferating the diabetes model pig carrying the mutant human hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene. A founder diabetes transgenic cloned pig was generated by SCNT and treated with insulin to allow for normal growth to maturity, at which point epididymal sperm could be collected for cryopreservation. In vitro fertilization and intrafallopian insemination using the cryopreserved epididymal sperm resulted in diabetes model transgenic offspring. These results suggest that artificial reproductive technology using cryopreserved epididymal sperm could be a practical option for proliferation of genetically modified disease model pigs.

24014008|t|Mody-3: novel HNF1A mutation and the utility of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonist therapy.
24014008|a|OBJECTIVE: An estimated 1 to 2% of cases of diabetes mellitus have a monogenic basis; however, delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis as type 1 and 2 diabetes are common. Correctly identifying the molecular basis of an individual's diabetes may significantly alter the management approach to both the patient and his or her relatives. We describe a case of mature onset diabetes of the young (MODY) with sufficient evidence to support the classification of a novel HNF1A (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha) mutation as a cause of MODY-3. METHODS: A 21-year-old Caucasian female presented to our office with a diagnosis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) at age 10; glycemia was initially managed with oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents and insulin detemir. The patient reported a strong family history of early-onset NIDDM in both her mother and maternal grandmother, both of whom eventually required insulin therapy to control glycemia. The patient's medical and family history were highly suggestive of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and genetic testing was performed. RESULTS: Genetic screening detected a mutation p. Arg200Trp in the HNF1A gene in the patient, her mother, and maternal grandmother, suggesting a diagnosis of MODY-3. This finding resulted in a change of antidiabetic therapy in all 3 patients, including the addition of once-daily liraglutide therapy, which helped improve their glycemic control. CONCLUSION: Our case report supports the classification of the p. Arg200Trp mutation as a cause of MODY-3. The findings also suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy may be of value in managing glycemia in patients with MODY-3.

24026547|t|Cost-effectiveness of MODY genetic testing: translating genomic advances into practical health applications.
24026547|a|OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a genetic testing policy for HNF1A-, HNF4A-, and GCK-MODY in a hypothetical cohort of type 2 diabetic patients 25-40 years old with a MODY prevalence of 2%. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used a simulation model of type 2 diabetes complications based on UK Prospective Diabetes Study data, modified to account for the natural history of disease by genetic subtype to compare a policy of genetic testing at diabetes diagnosis versus a policy of no testing. Under the screening policy, successful sulfonylurea treatment of HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY was modeled to produce a glycosylated hemoglobin reduction of -1.5% compared with usual care. GCK-MODY received no therapy. Main outcome measures were costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on lifetime risk of complications and treatments, expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (USD/QALY). RESULTS The testing policy yielded an average gain of 0.012 QALYs and resulted in an ICER of 205,000 USD. Sensitivity analysis showed that if the MODY prevalence was 6%, the ICER would be ~50,000 USD. If MODY prevalence was &gt;30%, the testing policy was cost saving. Reducing genetic testing costs to 700 USD also resulted in an ICER of ~50,000 USD. CONCLUSIONS Our simulated model suggests that a policy of testing for MODY in selected populations is cost-effective for the U.S. based on contemporary ICER thresholds. Higher prevalence of MODY in the tested population or decreased testing costs would enhance cost-effectiveness. Our results make a compelling argument for routine coverage of genetic testing in patients with high clinical suspicion of MODY.

24062323|t|Co-occurrence of risk alleles in or near genes modulating insulin secretion predisposes obese youth to prediabetes.
24062323|a|OBJECTIVE: Paralleling the rise of pediatric obesity, the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing among youth. In this study, we asked whether the co-occurrence of risk alleles in or near five genes modulating insulin secretion (TCF7L2 rs7903146, IGF2BP2 rs4402960, CDKAL1 rs7754840, HHEX rs1111875, and HNF1A rs1169288) is associated with a higher risk of IGT/T2D in obese children and adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 714 obese subjects (290 boys and 424 girls; mean age 13.6 +- 3.1 years; mean z score BMI 2.2 +- 0.4) and evaluated the insulin secretion by using the oral minimal model and, in a subgroup of 37 subjects, the hyperglycemic clamp. Also, 203 subjects were followed up for a mean of 2.1 years. RESULTS: We observed that the increase of risk alleles was associated with a progressive worsening of insulin secretion (P &lt; 0.001) mainly due to an impairment of the dynamic phase of insulin secretion (P = 0.004); the higher the number of the risk alleles, the higher the chance of progression from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to IGT/T2D (P = 0.022). Also, for those who were IGT at baseline, a higher risk score was associated with a lower odds to revert to NGT (P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Obese children and adolescents developing IGT/T2D have a higher genetic predisposition than those who do not show these diseases, and this predisposition is mainly related to gene variants modulating the early phase of insulin secretion. Although these data are very interesting, they need to be replicated in other cohorts.

24069322|t|Circulating CD36 is reduced in HNF1A-MODY carriers.
24069322|a|INTRODUCTION: Premature atherosclerosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for approximately 2% of all diabetes, with mutations in the transcription factor; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) accounting for the majority of MODY cases. There is somewhat limited data available on the prevalence of macrovascular disease in HNF1A-MODY carriers with diabetes. Marked insulin resistance and the associated dyslipidaemia are not clinical features of HNF1A-MODY carriers. The scavenger protein CD36 has been shown to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, largely through its interaction with oxidised LDL. Higher levels of monocyte CD36 and plasma CD36(sCD36) are seen to cluster with insulin resistance and diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine levels of sCD36 in participants with HNF1A-MODY diabetes and to compare them with unaffected normoglycaemic family members and participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We recruited 37 participants with HNF1A-MODY diabetes and compared levels of sCD36 with BMI-matched participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normoglycaemic HNF1A-MODY negative family controls. Levels of sCD36 were correlated with phenotypic and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: HNF1A-MODY participants were lean, normotensive, with higher HDL and lower triglyceride levels when compared to controls and participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. sCD36 was also significantly lower in HNF1A-MODY participants when compared to both the normoglycaemic family controls and to lean participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, sCD36 is significantly lower in lean participants with HNF1A-MODY diabetes when compared to weight-matched normoglycaemic familial HNF1A-MODY negative controls and to lean participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lower levels of this pro-atherogenic marker may result from the higher HDL component in the lipid profile of HNF1A-MODY participants.

24157454|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factors 1alpha/4alpha and forkhead box A2 regulate the solute carrier 2A2 (Slc2a2) gene expression in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats.
24157454|a|AIMS: Solute carrier 2a2 (Slc2a2) gene codifies the glucose transporter GLUT2, a key protein for glucose flux in hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells of proximal tubule. In diabetes mellitus, hepatic and tubular glucose output has been related to Slc2a2/GLUT2 overexpression; and controlling the expression of this gene may be an important adjuvant way to improve glycemic homeostasis. Thus, the present study investigated transcriptional mechanisms involved in the diabetes-induced overexpression of the Slc2a2 gene. MAIN METHODS: Hepatocyte nuclear factors 1alpha and 4alpha (HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta) mRNA expression (RT-PCR) and binding activity into the Slc2a2 promoter (electrophoretic mobility assay) were analyzed in the liver and kidney of diabetic and 6-day insulin-treated diabetic rats. KEY FINDINGS: Slc2a2/GLUT2 expression increased by more than 50% (P&lt;0.001) in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats, and 6-day insulin treatment restores these values to those observed in non-diabetic animals. Similarly, the mRNA expression and the binding activity of HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and FOXA2 increased by 50 to 100% (P&lt;0.05 to P&lt;0.001), also returning to values of non-diabetic rats after insulin treatment. Neither the Srebf1 and Cebpb mRNA expression, nor the SREBP-1c and C/EBP-beta binding activity was altered in diabetic rats. SIGNIFICANCE: HNF-1alpha, HNF-4alpha and FOXA2 transcriptional factors are involved in diabetes-induced overexpression of Slc2a2 gene in the liver and kidney. These data point out that these transcriptional factors are important targets to control GLUT2 expression in these tissues, which can contribute to glycemic homeostasis in diabetes.

24323243|t|De novo mutations of GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A may be more frequent in MODY than previously assumed.
24323243|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: MODY is mainly characterised by an early onset of diabetes and a positive family history of diabetes with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, de novo mutations have been reported anecdotally. The aim of this study was to systematically revisit a large collection of MODY patients to determine the minimum prevalence of de novo mutations in the most prevalent MODY genes (i.e. GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A). METHODS: Analysis of 922 patients from two national MODY centres (Slovakia and the Czech Republic) identified 150 probands (16%) who came from pedigrees that did not fulfil the criterion of two generations with diabetes but did fulfil the remaining criteria. The GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A genes were analysed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Mutations in GCK, HNF1A or HNF4A genes were detected in 58 of 150 individuals. Parents of 28 probands were unavailable for further analysis, and in 19 probands the mutation was inherited from an asymptomatic parent. In 11 probands the mutations arose de novo. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In our cohort of MODY patients from two national centres the de novo mutations in GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A were present in 7.3% of the 150 families without a history of diabetes and 1.2% of all of the referrals for MODY testing. This is the largest collection of de novo MODY mutations to date, and our findings indicate a much higher frequency of de novo mutations than previously assumed. Therefore, genetic testing of MODY could be considered for carefully selected individuals without a family history of diabetes.

24442509|t|Pleiotropic effects of HNF1A rs1183910 in a population-based study of 60,283 individuals.
24442509|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: According to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) a locus in the HNF1A gene has pleiotropic effects on several metabolic traits. In a large single-centre study we used the intronic variant rs1183910 located in a region with no or low recombination rate as an instrument for the HNF1A locus to evaluate pleiotropic effects of this locus on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as on body composition and levels of non-fasting glucose, lipids, acute-phase reactants, and biomarkers of liver and pancreas function. METHODS: We investigated 60,283 individuals from the Danish general population who were all examined in the same laboratory, comprising the Copenhagen General Population Study. RESULTS: We confirm previous GWAS findings, namely that the minor rs1183910 A allele is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (p(trend) = 0.003), decreased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP; p(trend) = 6 x 10(-76)) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (p(trend) = 4 x 10(-48)), and increased levels of total cholesterol (p(trend) = 3 x 10(-10)) and LDL-cholesterol (p(trend) = 3 x 10(-11)). For the first time, we report that the minor rs1183910 A allele is associated with increased levels of non-fasting plasma glucose (p(trend) = 3 x 10(-5)), apolipoprotein B (ApoB; p(trend) = 1 x 10(-4)) and alkaline phosphatase (p(trend) = 5 x 10(-14)), and decreased levels of bilirubin (p trend = 3 x 10(-5)). Our results suggest that the association with increased risk of type 2 diabetes is driven by high non-fasting glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The minor rs1183910 A allele prompts a potential adverse metabolic profile with increased levels of non-fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, ApoB, and alkaline phosphatase, but simultaneously has potential beneficial effects through decreased levels of CRP, gamma-glutamyltransferase and bilirubin.

24476040|t|Evaluation of a target region capture sequencing platform using monogenic diabetes as a study-model.
24476040|a|BACKGROUND: Monogenic diabetes is a genetic disease often caused by mutations in genes involved in beta-cell function. Correct sub-categorization of the disease is a prerequisite for appropriate treatment and genetic counseling. Target-region capture sequencing is a combination of genomic region enrichment and next generation sequencing which might be used as an efficient way to diagnose various genetic disorders. We aimed to develop a target-region capture sequencing platform to screen 117 selected candidate genes involved in metabolism for mutations and to evaluate its performance using monogenic diabetes as a study-model. RESULTS: The performance of the assay was evaluated in 70 patients carrying known disease causing mutations previously identified in HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, INS, or KCNJ11. Target regions with a less than 20-fold sequencing depth were either introns or UTRs. When only considering translated regions, the coverage was 100% with a 50-fold minimum depth. Among the 70 analyzed samples, 63 small size single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels as well as 7 large deletions and duplications were identified as being the pathogenic variants. The mutations identified by the present technique were identical with those previously identified through Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification. CONCLUSIONS: We hereby demonstrated that the established platform as an accurate and high-throughput gene testing method which might be useful in the clinical diagnosis of monogenic diabetes.

24549415|t|Less but better: cardioprotective lipid profile of patients with GCK-MODY despite lower HDL cholesterol level.
24549415|a|Patients with diabetes caused by single-gene mutations generally exhibit an altered course of diabetes. Those with mutations of the glucokinase gene (GCK-MODY) show good metabolic control and low risk of cardiovascular complications despite paradoxically lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In order to investigate the matter, we analyzed the composition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL subpopulations in such individuals. The LipoPrint( ) system (Quantimetrix, USA) based on non-denaturing, linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate and measure LDL and HDL subclasses in fresh-frozen serum samples from patients with mutations of glucokinase or HNF1A, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and healthy controls. Fresh serum samples from a total of 37 monogenic diabetes patients (21 from GCK-MODY and 16 from HNF1A-MODY), 22 T1DM patients and 15 healthy individuals were measured in this study. Concentrations of the small, highly atherogenic LDL subpopulation were similar among the compared groups. Large HDL percentage was significantly higher in GCK-MODY than in control (p = 0.0003), T1DM (p = 0.0006) and HNF1A-MODY groups (p = 0.0246). Patients with GCK-MODY were characterized by significantly lower intermediate HDL levels than controls (p = 0.0003) and T1DM (p = 0.0005). Small, potentially atherogenic HDL content differed significantly with the GCK-MODY group showing concentrations of that subfraction from control (p = 0.0096), T1DM (p = 0.0193) and HNF1A-MODY (p = 0.0057) groups. Within-group heterogeneity suggested the existence of potential gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. GCK-MODY is characterized by a strongly protective profile of HDL cholesterol subpopulations. A degree of heterogeneity within the groups suggests the existence of interactions with other genetic or clinical factors.

24559927|t|Roles of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha in pancreatic beta-cells: lessons from a monogenic form of diabetes (MODY).
24559927|a|Mutations in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha and HNF4alpha cause a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The primary cause of MODY is an impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells, indicating the important roles of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha in beta-cells. Large-scale genetic studies have clarified that the common variants of HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes are also associated with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that they are involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Recent experimental studies revealed that HNF1alpha controls both beta-cell function and growth by regulating target genes such as glucose transporter 2, pyruvate kinase, collectrin, hepatocyte growth factor activator, and HNF4alpha. In contrast, HNF4alpha mainly regulates the function of beta-cells. Although direct target genes of HNF4alpha in beta-cells are largely unknown, we recently identified Anks4b as a novel target of HNF4alpha that regulates beta-cell susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Studies of MODY have led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells.

24567025|t|Meglitinide analogues in adolescent patients with HNF1A-MODY (MODY 3).
24567025|a|For pediatric patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A (HNF1A)-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY 3), treatment with sulfonylureas is recommended. In adults with HNF1A-MODY, meglitinide analogues achieve lower postprandial glucose levels and pose a lower risk of delayed hypoglycemia compared with sulfonylureas. This therapy has not yet been reviewed in pediatric patients. We report on meglitinide analogue treatment in 3 adolescents with HNF1A-MODY. Case 1 (14-year-old girl) was diagnosed asymptomatically but had an hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 7.4%; her father had been recently diagnosed with HNF1A-MODY. With repaglinide, her HbA1c level decreased to 5.5%, with no hypoglycemic episodes. Case 2 (14-year-old boy) was diagnosed incidentally with glucosuria (HbA1c level: 7.0%) and was treated with insulin. After the HNF1A-MODY diagnosis, he was switched to glibenclamide. Due to several hypoglycemic episodes, treatment was changed to nateglinide and his HbA1c level decreased to 6.2% with no further hypoglycemic episodes. Case 3 (11-year-old girl) presented with polyuria and polydipsia (HbA1c level: 10.1%) and was initially treated with insulin. After the HNF1A-MODY diagnosis, treatment was changed to repaglinide. She was obese (BMI: 28.8 kg/m(2); z-score: +2.2), and glucose control with repaglinide alone was insufficient. Therefore, neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (0.27 U/kg per day) was added. With this combination therapy, her HbA1c level decreased to 8.2%. The use of meglitinides in these 3 adolescent patients was well tolerated and effective. Furthermore, hypoglycemic episodes were rare compared with treatment with insulin or sulfonylureas. We therefore suggest considering meglitinides as the primary oral treatment option for adolescents suffering from HNF1A-MODY.

24642958|t|A family with a novel termination mutation in hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha in maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 which is unresponsive to sulphonylurea therapy.
24642958|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus. AIMS: To identify the genetic basis in a family with 3 generations of diabetes and to assess the concordance between the genotype and phenotype. METHODS: A molecular analysis was performed on genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. A mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) was performed with/without glibenclamide. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all family members with diabetes due to the location of the mutation. RESULTS: A novel c.618G&gt;A, p.W206X termination mutation was identified in the hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) gene. The mutation was identified in the proband and 8 of the 14 family members tested. An MMTT stimulus (+-2.5 and 5 mg glibenclamide) produced a similar glucose profile and C-peptide graph in both the obese proband and her nonobese mother, showing no effect of the glibenclamide. No evidence of liver adenomas was found in the abdominal ultrasonography. CONCLUSIONS: We described a novel c.618G&gt;A, p.W206X mutation in HNF1alpha associated with MODY 3 but not with hepatocellular adenoma. In contradistinction to most MODY 3 mutations, treatment with sulphonylurea was found to be a clinically ineffective alternative to insulin therapy.

24677712|t|Incretin effect and glucagon responses to oral and intravenous glucose in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young--type 2 and type 3.
24677712|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous subgroup of nonautoimmune diabetes, constituting 1-2% of all diabetes. Because little is known about incretin function in patients with MODY, we studied the incretin effect and hormone responses to oral and intravenous glucose loads in patients with glucokinase (GCK)-diabetes (MODY2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A)-diabetes (MODY3), respectively, and in matched healthy control subjects. Both MODY groups exhibited glucose intolerance after oral glucose (most pronounced in patients with HNF1A-diabetes), but only patients with HNF1A-diabetes had impaired incretin effect and inappropriate glucagon responses to OGTT. Both groups of patients with diabetes showed normal suppression of glucagon in response to intravenous glucose. Thus, HNF1A-diabetes, similar to type 2 diabetes, is characterized by an impaired incretin effect and inappropriate glucagon responses, whereas incretin effect and glucagon response to oral glucose remain unaffected in GCK-diabetes, reflecting important pathogenetic differences between the two MODY forms.

24736738|t|A decade of molecular genetic testing for MODY: a retrospective study of utilization in The Netherlands.
24736738|a|Genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) may be relevant for treatment and prognosis in patients with usually early-onset, non-ketotic, insulin-sensitive diabetes and for monitoring strategies in non-diabetic mutation carriers. This study describes the first 10 years of genetic testing for MODY in The Netherlands in terms of volume and test positive rate, medical setting, purpose of the test and age of patients tested. Some analyses focus on the most prevalent subtype, HNF1A MODY. Data were retrospectively extracted from a laboratory database. In total, 502 individuals were identified with a pathogenic mutation in HNF4A, GCK or HNF1A between 2001 and 2010. Although mutation scanning for MODY was used at an increasing rate, cascade testing was only used for one relative, on average, per positive index patient. Testing for HNF1A MODY was mostly requested by internists and paediatricians, often from regional hospitals. Primary care physicians and clinical geneticists rarely requested genetic testing for HNF1A MODY. Clinical geneticists requested cascade testing relatively more often than other health professionals. A substantial proportion (currently 29%) of HNF1A MODY probands was at least 40 years old at the time of testing. In conclusion, the number of individuals genetically tested for MODY so far in The Netherlands is low compared with previously predicted numbers of patients. Doctors' valuation of the test and patients' and family members' response to (an offer of) genetic testing on the other hand need to be investigated. Efforts may be needed to develop and implement translational guidelines.

24848070|t|Recessive mutations in PCBD1 cause a new type of early-onset diabetes.
24848070|a|Mutations in several genes cause nonautoimmune diabetes, but numerous patients still have unclear genetic defects, hampering our understanding of the development of the disease and preventing pathogenesis-oriented treatment. We used whole-genome sequencing with linkage analysis to study a consanguineous family with early-onset antibody-negative diabetes and identified a novel deletion in PCBD1 (pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase/dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha), a gene that was recently proposed as a likely cause of diabetes. A subsequent reevaluation of patients with mild neonatal hyperphenylalaninemia due to mutations in PCBD1 from the BIODEF database identified three additional patients who had developed HNF1A-like diabetes in puberty, indicating early beta-cell failure. We found that Pcbd1 is expressed in the developing pancreas of both mouse and Xenopus embryos from early specification onward showing colocalization with insulin. Importantly, a morpholino-mediated knockdown in Xenopus revealed that pcbd1 activity is required for the proper establishment of early pancreatic fate within the endoderm. We provide the first genetic evidence that PCBD1 mutations can cause early-onset nonautoimmune diabetes with features similar to dominantly inherited HNF1A-diabetes. This condition responds to and can be treated with oral drugs instead of insulin, which is important clinical information for these patients. Finally, patients at risk can be detected through a newborn screening for phenylketonuria.

24906951|t|Type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene variants predispose to adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.
24906951|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is phenotypically a hybrid of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Genetically LADA is poorly characterised but does share genetic predisposition with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to improve the genetic characterisation of LADA and hypothesised that type 2 diabetes-associated gene variants also predispose to LADA, and that the associations would be strongest in LADA patients with low levels of GAD autoantibodies (GADA). METHODS: We assessed 41 type 2 diabetes-associated gene variants in Finnish (phase I) and Swedish (phase II) patients with LADA (n = 911) or type 1 diabetes (n = 406), all diagnosed after the age of 35 years, as well as in non-diabetic control individuals 40 years or older (n = 4,002). RESULTS: Variants in the ZMIZ1 (rs12571751, p = 4.1 x 10(-5)) and TCF7L2 (rs7903146, p = 5.8 x 10(-4)) loci were strongly associated with LADA. Variants in the KCNQ1 (rs2237895, p = 0.0012), HHEX (rs1111875, p = 0.0024 in Finns) and MTNR1B (rs10830963, p = 0.0039) loci showed the strongest association in patients with low GADA, supporting the hypothesis that the disease in these patients is more like type 2 diabetes. In contrast, variants in the KLHDC5 (rs10842994, p = 9.5 x 10(-4) in Finns), TP53INP1 (rs896854, p = 0.005), CDKAL1 (rs7756992, p = 7.0 x 10(-4); rs7754840, p = 8.8 x 10(-4)) and PROX1 (rs340874, p = 0.003) loci showed the strongest association in patients with high GADA. For type 1 diabetes, a strong association was seen for MTNR1B (rs10830963, p = 3.2 x 10(-6)) and HNF1A (rs2650000, p = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: LADA and adult-onset type 1 diabetes share genetic risk variants with type 2 diabetes, supporting the idea of a hybrid form of diabetes and distinguishing them from patients with classical young-onset type 1 diabetes.

24915262|t|Association of a low-frequency variant in HNF1A with type 2 diabetes in a Latino population.
24915262|a|IMPORTANCE: Latino populations have one of the highest prevalences of type 2 diabetes worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to explore potential molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed relationships. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3756 Mexican and US Latino individuals (1794 with type 2 diabetes and 1962 without diabetes) recruited from 1993 to 2013. One variant was further tested for allele frequency and association with type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic data sets of 14,276 participants and characterized in experimental assays. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included age of onset, body mass index, and effect on protein function. RESULTS: A single rare missense variant (c.1522G&gt;A [p.E508K]) was associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 5.48; 95% CI, 2.83-10.61; P = 4.4 x 10(-7)) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), the gene responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). This variant was observed in 0.36% of participants without type 2 diabetes and 2.1% of participants with it. In multiethnic replication data sets, the p.E508K variant was seen only in Latino patients (n = 1443 with type 2 diabetes and 1673 without it) and was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.75-9.92; P = .0013). In experimental assays, HNF-1A protein encoding the p.E508K mutant demonstrated reduced transactivation activity of its target promoter compared with a wild-type protein. In our data, carriers and noncarriers of the p.E508K mutation with type 2 diabetes had no significant differences in compared clinical characteristics, including age at onset. The mean (SD) age for carriers was 45.3 years (11.2) vs 47.5 years (11.5) for noncarriers (P = .49) and the mean (SD) BMI for carriers was 28.2 (5.5) vs 29.3 (5.3) for noncarriers (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the MODY3-causing gene HNF1A that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may affect protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but additional studies are required.

24929431|t|Glucose-lowering effects and low risk of hypoglycemia in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young when treated with a GLP-1 receptor agonist: a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial.
24929431|a|OBJECTIVE: The most common form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A diabetes: MODY3) is often treated with sulfonylureas that confer a high risk of hypoglycemia. We evaluated treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in patients with HNF1A diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with HNF1A diabetes (8 women; mean age 39 years [range 23-67 years]; BMI 24.9 +- 0.5 kg/m(2) [mean +- SEM]; fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 9.9 +- 0.9 mmol/L; HbA1c 6.4 +- 0.2% [47 +- 3 mmol/mol]) received 6 weeks of treatment with a GLP-1RA (liraglutide) and placebo (tablets), as well as a sulfonylurea (glimepiride) and placebo (injections), in randomized order, in a double-blind, crossover trial. Glimepiride was up-titrated once weekly in a treat-to-target manner; liraglutide was up-titrated once weekly to 1.8 mg once daily. At baseline and at the end of each treatment period a standardized liquid meal test was performed, including a 30-min light bicycle test. RESULTS: FPG decreased during the treatment periods (-1.6 +- 0.5 mmol/L liraglutide [P = 0.012] and -2.8 +- 0.7 mmol/L glimepiride [P = 0.003]), with no difference between treatments (P = 0.624). Postprandial plasma glucose (PG) responses (total area under the curve) were lower with both glimepiride (2,136 +- 292 min x mmol/L) and liraglutide (2,624 +- 340 min x mmol/L) compared with baseline (3,127 +- 291 min x mmol/L; P &lt; 0.001, glimepiride; P = 0.017, liraglutide), with no difference between treatments (P = 0.121). Eighteen episodes of hypoglycemia (PG &lt;=3.9 mmol/L) occurred during glimepiride treatment and one during liraglutide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Six weeks of treatment with glimepiride or liraglutide lowered FPG and postprandial glucose excursions in patients with HNF1A diabetes. The glucose-lowering effect was greater with glimepiride at the expense of a higher risk of exclusively mild hypoglycemia.

24933231|t|Associations between the common HNF1A gene variant p.I27L (rs1169288) and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus are influenced by weight.
24933231|a|AIM: The common variants p.I27L (rs1169288), p.A98V (rs1800574) and p.S487N (rs2464196) of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) gene have been inconsistently associated with impaired glucose tolerance and/or an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The present study aimed to investigate whether these associations are affected by weight. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 861 Japanese subjects (males: 65.5%; 61.8+-12.3years) attending a health-screening programme. Interactive effects between HNF1A variants and weight status on risk of T2DM or dysglycaemic status were determined. RESULTS: The 27L variant carriers were at higher risk of T2DM and dysglycaemic status than non-carriers, but only in normal-weight subjects [odds ratio (OR): 2.04, P=0.03 and OR: 2.56, P=0.01, respectively]. An interactive effect of the p.I27L (rs1169288) variant and weight status on the risk of dysglycaemic status was found (P=0.04). Age, but not body mass index (BMI), was a risk factor for dysglycaemic status in the 27L carriers (OR: 1.05, P=0.0003), whereas BMI was a risk factor in non-carriers (OR: 1.23, P=0.008). No carriers of 98V were identified, and 487N was not associated with either T2DM or dysglycaemic status in our study population. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the HNF1A p.I27L (rs1169288) variant may be a significant risk factor of T2DM in normal-weight subjects and that earlier inconsistent results may have been due, in part, to subjects' weight status. Further investigations in larger cohorts are needed to verify these findings.

25041077|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young in India - a distinctive mutation pattern identified through targeted next-generation sequencing.
25041077|a|OBJECTIVE: To establish and utilize a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based strategy to screen for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) gene mutations in subjects with early-onset diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genetic testing was carried out in 80 subjects of Asian Indian origin with young onset diabetes to identify mutations in a comprehensive panel of ten MODY genes. A novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based target enrichment was established, followed by NGS on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). All the mutations and rare variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We identified mutations in 11 (19%) of the 56 clinically diagnosed MODY subjects and seven of these mutations were novel. The identified mutations include p.H241Q, p.E59Q, c.-162G&gt;A 5' UTR in NEUROD1, p.V169I cosegregating with c.493-4G&gt;A and c.493-20C&gt;T, p.E271K in HNF4A, p.A501S in HNF1A, p.E440X in GCK, p.V177M in PDX1, p.L92F in HNF1B and p.R31L in PAX4 genes. Interestingly, two patients with NEUROD1 mutation were also positive for the p.E224K mutation in PDX1 gene. These patients with coexisting NEUROD1-PDX1 mutations showed a marked reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion. All 24 subjects who had not met the clinical criteria of MODY were negative for the mutations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1 and PAX4 mutations from India. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR coupled with NGS provides a rapid, cost-effective and accurate method for comprehensive parallelized genetic testing of MODY. When compared to earlier reports, we have identified a higher frequency and a novel digenic mutation pattern involving NEUROD1 and PDX1 genes.

25082184|t|Identifying monogenic diabetes in a pediatric cohort with presumed type 1 diabetes.
25082184|a|OBJECTIVE: Monogenic diabetes (MD) is rare and can often be confused with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a pediatric cohort. We sought to determine clinical criteria that could optimally identify candidates for genetic testing of two common forms of MD that alter therapy: glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 939 patients with a presumed diagnosis of T1D, 6 months-20 yr of age, and identified four clinical criteria that were unusual for T1D and could warrant further evaluation for MD: (i) negative pancreatic autoantibodies, (ii) evidence of prolonged endogenous insulin production, or (iii) strong family history of diabetes in multiple generations. One hundred and twenty-one patients were identified as having one or more of these high-risk clinical criteria and were offered screening for mutations in GCK and HNF1alpha; 58 consented for genetic testing. RESULTS: Of 58 patients with presumed T1D who underwent genetic testing, four were found to have GCK and one had HNF1alpha. No patients with only one high-risk feature were found to have MD. Of 10 patients who had two or more high risk criteria, five had MD (50%). CONCLUSION: A high frequency of MD from mutations in GCK/HNF1alpha may be identified among pediatric diabetic patients originally considered to have T1D by performing genetic testing on those patients with multiple clinical risk factors for MD.

25264246|t|Metabolic inflexibility impairs insulin secretion and results in MODY-like diabetes in triple FoxO-deficient mice.
25264246|a|Pancreatic beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes is associated with functional abnormalities of insulin secretion and deficits of beta cell mass. It's unclear how one begets the other. We have shown that loss of beta cell mass can be ascribed to impaired FoxO1 function in different models of diabetes. Here we show that ablation of the three FoxO genes (1, 3a, and 4) in mature beta cells results in early-onset, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-like diabetes, with abnormalities of the MODY networks Hnf4alpha, Hnf1alpha, and Pdx1. FoxO-deficient beta cells are metabolically inflexible, i.e., they preferentially utilize lipids rather than carbohydrates as an energy source. This results in impaired ATP generation and reduced Ca(2+)-dependent insulin secretion. The present findings demonstrate a secretory defect caused by impaired FoxO activity that antedates dedifferentiation. We propose that defects in both pancreatic beta cell function and mass arise through FoxO-dependent mechanisms during diabetes progression.

25266181|t|Clinical and molecular characterization of maturity onset-diabetes of the young caused by hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha mutation: red flags for prediction of the diagnosis.
25266181|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in Saudi population remains unknown, and data on molecular etiology of this condition is limited. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to elucidate clinical and molecular characteristics of a Saudi family with MODY 1. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a case series study conducted at Saad Specialist Hospital in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 12-year-old female presented to us with symptoms suggestive of diabetes. Investigations revealed hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketonuria without acidosis. Pancreatic antibodies were negative. She responded well to subcutaneous insulin. Her family history revealed that 2 of her siblings were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), while her father and mother had type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In view of this strong family history, the possibility of monogenic diabetes was raised, and the 2 genes consistent with this phenotype, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1a) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4a), were studied. Accordingly, genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the 8 members of this family, polymerase chain reaction was carried out, and sequencing of the whole HNF4a and HNF1a genes was done. RESULTS: DNA study of the proband revealed a heterozygous substitution in intron 1 (IVS1b C &gt; T-5)(c.50-5C &gt; T) of the HNF1a gene. This mutation was identified in other 5 members of the family. CONCLUSION: This study alerts physicians to suspect MODY in patients who have a strongly positive family history of diabetes over a few generations with negative pancreatic antibodies and absence of ketoacidosis and obesity.
