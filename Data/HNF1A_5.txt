25327507|t|A pharmacogenetic association between a variation in calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene and the response to metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.
25327507|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate possible associations of the single-nucleotide variants in six genes encoding the key molecules mediating the metformin pharmacodynamic effect with the response to treatment with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. PRKAA1 rs249429, STK11 rs741765, PCK1 rs4810083, PPARGC1A rs10213440, HNF1A rs11086926, and CAPN10 rs3792269 variants were genotyped. The outcomes of the study were treatment success defined by achieving HbA1c &lt;7 % and absolute reduction in HbAlc after 6-month metformin therapy. The relationships between genotypes and outcomes were evaluated in multivariate logistic and linear models. The level of statistical significance after Bonferroni correction was predefined as p&lt;0.0083. RESULTS: The minor G-allele of CAPN10 rs3792269 A&gt;G polymorphism was significantly associated with less treatment success with an odds ratio of 0.27 (95 % CI 0.12-0.62, p=0.002) per variant allele. When the reduction in HbA1c was analyzed as a quantitative trait, G-allele was nominally associated with a smaller reduction in HbA1c (per allele beta=-0.26, 95 % CI -0.50 to -0.02, p=0.032). The reduction in HbA1c in minor allele carriers (24 % of study population) was smaller by 0.3 % in comparison with the major allele homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the first observation of an association between a variant in CAPN10 gene and the response to metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. This observation needs to be replicated in further studies in different populations.

25361053|t|Early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated to HNF4A T130I polymorphism in families of central Spain.
25361053|a|PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young present some similar clinical and biochemical characteristics that make them difficult to differentiate. Currently, the polymorphism T130I (rs1800961) in the HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A) gene has been described as a risk factor to type 2 DM and shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern associated to beta-cell function decrease. The aim of the present work was to characterize the phenotypic profile of the T130I carrier and noncarrier relatives included in 3 unrelated families. METHODS: We studied GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing in 3 unrelated subjects from Valladolid, Spain, in which maturity-onset diabetes of the young was suspected. We collected genetic, clinical, and biochemical data from these subjects and their relatives in order to check the presence of the T130I polymorphism. RESULTS: The heterozygous T130I mutation was the unique functional gene variation that could explain diabetes phenotype. We observed significant differences in glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and Homeostasis Model Assessment index when we compared T130I mutation carriers and noncarriers. Diabetes diagnosed in T130I mutation carriers was related to stressful situations in an earlier age and tightly associated with gestational diabetes. Fasting plasma glucose and HbA(1c) levels increased with age in all carriers (r = 0.69 and r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the T130I variant in HNF4A as a major susceptibility genotype associated with early-onset type 2 DM. Healthy carriers of this mutation require a stricter control in the population of central Spain.

25395195|t|Exploring the Genomic Roadmap and Molecular Phylogenetics Associated with MODY Cascades Using Computational Biology.
25395195|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a metabolic and genetic disorder. It is different from type 1 and type 2 diabetes with low occurrence level (1-2%) among all diabetes. This disorder is a consequence of beta-cell dysfunction. Till date, 11 subtypes of MODY have been identified, and all of them can cause gene mutations. However, very little is known about the gene mapping, molecular phylogenetics, and co-expression among MODY genes and networking between cascades. This study has used latest servers and software such as VarioWatch, ClustalW, MUSCLE, G Blocks, Phylogeny.fr, iTOL, WebLogo, STRING, and KEGG PATHWAY to perform comprehensive analyses of gene mapping, multiple sequences alignment, molecular phylogenetics, protein-protein network design, co-expression analysis of MODY genes, and pathway development. The MODY genes are located in chromosomes-2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 20. Highly aligned block shows Pro, Gly, Leu, Arg, and Pro residues are highly aligned in the positions of 296, 386, 437, 455, 456 and 598, respectively. Alignment scores inform us that HNF1A and HNF1B proteins have shown high sequence similarity among MODY proteins. Protein-protein network design shows that HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, NEUROD1, PDX1, PAX4, INS, and GCK are strongly connected, and the co-expression analyses between MODY genes also show distinct association between HNF1A and HNF4A genes. This study has used latest tools of bioinformatics to develop a rapid method to assess the evolutionary relationship, the network development, and the associations among eleven MODY genes and cascades. The prediction of sequence conservation, molecular phylogenetics, protein-protein network and the association between the MODY cascades enhances opportunities to get more insights into the less-known MODY disease.

25425063|t|A 12q24.31 interstitial deletion in an adult male with MODY3: neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological characteristics.
25425063|a|A 39-year-old male patient with a disharmonic intelligence profile and juvenile diabetes mellitus is described. At 14 months of age, minor facial dysmorphisms were noticed. He had delayed motor development, obesity at early age, and a diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes at the age of 10 years. He successfully completed secondary education and has been engaged in unskilled work activities, living independently. Upon examination, no psychiatric symptoms were present and his neuropsychological profile showed normal, although disharmonic, intellectual capacities and suboptimal social cognition. Genome wide array analysis identified an interstitial 12q24.31 deletion of 1.67 Mb encompassing hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha gene (HNF1A), supporting a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. Results are discussed in relation to the few identified or published overlapping deletions. This is the first patient with normal intelligence in whom the presence of subtle facial dysmorphisms were decisive for introducing genetic analysis that, in turn, disclosed a rare form of diabetes necessitating modifications in treatment regimen. Clinicians, including those involved in psychiatry, should be aware of the diagnostic and prognostic value of atypical physical features in patients with a long history of complicated glucose regulation.

25483937|t|Treatment of young patients with HNF1A mutations (HNF1A-MODY).
25483937|a|AIM: Children and adolescents with a molecular diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY should be treated with oral sulfonylurea according to current International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines. METHODS: We surveyed the German-Austrian DPV database of 50 043 people and included 114 patients with a confirmed molecular-genetic diagnosis of HNF1A mutation and diabetes onset at below age 18 years. We analysed hypoglycaemic episodes, metabolic control (HbA1c ) and other clinical variables according to treatment groups. RESULTS: People with HNF1A-MODY were included and analysed according to treatment with insulin alone (n = 34), sulfonylurea (n = 30), meglitinides (n = 22) or lifestyle (n = 28). In those receiving any drug treatment (n = 86), severe hypoglycaemia did not occur with meglitinide and was highest (at 3.6 events per 100 patient-years) with insulin. HbA1c was highest with insulin treatment (insulin = 58 mmol/mol, 7.5%; sulfonylurea = 55 mmol/mol, 7.2%; meglitinides = 52 mmol/mol, 6.9%; P = 0.008), whereas weight (BMI SD score), serum lipids and blood pressure were not different. CONCLUSIONS: Of note, 40% of people with HNF1A-MODY and medical treatment were receiving insulin alone and thus were not being treated in line with up-to-date International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes/International Diabetes Federation guidelines, despite insulin treatment being associated with worse metabolic control and the risk of hypoglycaemia. The unlicensed use of oral drugs in patients below age 18 years and adherence by both doctors and patients to the initial insulin treatment might contribute to this finding.

25501962|t|Intima-media thickness and endothelial dysfunction in GCK and HNF1A-MODY patients.
25501962|a|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene, along with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) gene mutations, are the most frequent cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). GCK-MODY patients are typically characterized by a moderate fasting hyperglycemia; however, little is known about atherosclerosis and intermediate-related phenotypes in these subjects. DESIGN: To examine carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and endothelial function assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in GCK gene mutations carriers and HNF1A-MODY. METHODS: A total of 64 subjects with GCK gene mutations, and 52 HNF1A gene mutation carriers as well as 53 nondiabetic controls were examined. IMT and FMD were assessed by ultrasonography. Appropriate statistical tests were performed to assess differences between the groups, and multivariate linear regression was done for the association with IMT and FMD. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of all groups were similar with the mean age at examination of 35.1, 41.1, and 39.5 years for GCK, HNF1A and the control group respectively. The highest mean IMT value was in the HNF1A-MODY group: 7.0+-1.4 mm, whereas it reached 6.3+-1.4 mm in GCK mutation carriers and 6.3+-1.3 mm in controls (P=0.008). After adjustment for possible clinical and biochemical cofounders, IMT remained higher in HNF1A-MODY patients as compared with GCK-MODY patients (P=0.02) and controls (P=0.0003). FMD was significantly lower in HNF1A (9.9+-4.6%) and GCK-MODY (11.1+-4.6%) patients in comparison with controls (13.9+-4.7%; P=0.0001). After adjustment, FMD remained lower in HNF1A-MODY (P=0.0005) and GCK-MODY patients (P=0.01) as compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both examined MODY groups demonstrated evidence of endothelial dysfunction. In addition, HNF1-MODY patients seem to be more prone to an early atherosclerotic phenotype.

25555642|t|Molecular genetic testing of patients with monogenic diabetes and hyperinsulinism.
25555642|a|Genetic sequencing has become a critical part of the diagnosis of certain forms of pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Despite great advances in the speed and cost of DNA sequencing, determining the pathogenicity of variants remains a challenge, and requires sharing of sequence and phenotypic data between laboratories. We reviewed all diabetes and hyperinsulinism-associated molecular testing done at the Seattle Children's Molecular Genetics Laboratory from 2009 to 2013. 331 probands were referred to us for molecular genetic sequencing for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM), Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), or Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) during this period. Reportable variants were identified in 115 (35%) patients with 91 variants in one of 6 genes: HNF1A, GCK, HNF4A, ABCC8, KCNJ11, or INS. In addition to identifying 23 novel variants, we identified unusual mechanisms of inheritance, including mosaic and digenic MODY presentations. Re-analysis of all reported variants using more recently available databases led to a change in variant interpretation from the original report in 30% of cases. These results represent a resource for molecular testing of monogenic forms of diabetes and hyperinsulinism, providing a mutation spectrum for these disorders in a large North American cohort. In addition, they highlight the importance of periodic review of molecular testing results.

25569436|t|Identifying gene disruptions in novel balanced de novo constitutional translocations in childhood cancer patients by whole-genome sequencing.
25569436|a|PURPOSE: We applied whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to children diagnosed with neoplasms and found to carry apparently balanced constitutional translocations to discover novel genic disruptions. METHODS: We applied the structural variation (SV) calling programs CREST, BreakDancer, SV-STAT, and CGAP-CNV, and we developed an annotative filtering strategy to achieve nucleotide resolution at the translocations. RESULTS: We identified the breakpoints for t(6;12)(p21.1;q24.31), disrupting HNF1A in a patient diagnosed with hepatic adenomas and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Translocation as the disruptive event of HNF1A, a gene known to be involved in MODY3, has not been previously reported. In a subject with Hodgkin lymphoma and subsequent low-grade glioma, we identified t(5;18)(q35.1;q21.2), disrupting both SLIT3 and DCC, genes previously implicated in both glioma and lymphoma. CONCLUSION: These examples suggest that implementing clinical WGS in the diagnostic workup of patients with novel but apparently balanced translocations may reveal unanticipated disruption of disease-associated genes and aid in prediction of the clinical phenotype.

25575005|t|Occurrence of amino acid mutation (Ala98Val) of HNF1alpha in association with type II diabetes.
25575005|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 is a monogenic form of diabetes. Gene defects in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor -1 alpha (HNF1a) causes MODY3. HNF1a gene located in the chromosome (12q24.2) codes for a transcription factor which helps in signalling of insulin exocytosis in pancreatic Beta cells. A prevalent amino acid polymorphism at codon 98-Ala98Val (exon 1) of the HNF1a was shown to be associated with diabetes in the South Indian population. Since Nepal shares the ancestral origin with India and people have been sharing similar lifestyles for a long period of life it was relevant to check the occurrence of same mutation in diabetic population of Nepal as well. The study was carried out to identify the occurrence of amino acid mutation (Ala98Val) of HNF 1 alpha in association with type 2 diabetes in diabetic population of Kathmandu. METHODS: DNA samples were randomly collected from 12 non-diabetic and 56 diabetic patients. The DNA samples were amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was carried out to identify the occurrence of the mutation. RESULTS: During the study, out of 12 non-diabetic samples, nine were normal while three samples showed heterozygous Ala98Val mutation. Whereas, eight diabetic patients were found to have Ala98Val mutation and rest 48 had normal genotype. The study thus showed 16.17% occurence of Ala98Val mutation among 68 samples. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the occurrence of Ala98Val amino acid mutation in diabetic samples that were taken under study.

25581748|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY): an update.
25581748|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of monogenic disorders characterized by autosomal dominantly inherited non-insulin dependent form of diabetes classically presenting in adolescence or young adults before the age of 25 years. MODY is a rare cause of diabetes (1% of all cases) and is frequently misdiagnosed as Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) or Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A precise molecular diagnosis is essential because it leads to optimal treatment of the patients and allows early diagnosis for their asymptomatic family members. Mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) (MODY 2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1A/4A (MODY 3 and MODY 1) genes are the most common causes of MODY. GCK mutations cause a mild, asymptomatic, and stable fasting hyperglycemia usually requiring no specific treatment. However, mutations in the HNF1A and HNF4A cause a progressive pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and hyperglycemia that can result in microvascular complications. Sulfonylureas are effective in these patients by acting on adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels, although insulin therapy may be required later in life. Mutations in the HNF1B (MODY 5) is associated with pancreatic agenesis, renal abnormalities, genital tract malformations, and liver dysfunction. Compared to MODY 1, 2, 3, and 5, the remaining subtypes of MODY have a much lower prevalence. In this review, we summarize the main clinical and laboratory characteristics of the common and rarer causes of MODY.

25768928|t|Pleiotropy among common genetic loci identified for cardiometabolic disorders and C-reactive protein.
25768928|a|Pleiotropic genetic variants have independent effects on different phenotypes. C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with several cardiometabolic phenotypes. Shared genetic backgrounds may partially underlie these associations. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify the shared genetic background of inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We also evaluated whether the pleiotropic effects of such loci were biological or mediated in nature. First, we examined whether 283 common variants identified for 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes in GWAS are associated with CRP level. Second, we tested whether 18 variants identified for serum CRP are associated with 10 cardiometabolic phenotypes. We used a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 1.1x10-04 (0.05/463) as a threshold of significance. We evaluated the independent pleiotropic effect on both phenotypes using individual level data from the Women Genome Health Study. Evaluating the genetic overlap between inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes, we found 13 pleiotropic regions. Additional analyses showed that 6 regions (APOC1, HNF1A, IL6R, PPP1R3B, HNF4A and IL1F10) appeared to have a pleiotropic effect on CRP independent of the effects on the cardiometabolic phenotypes. These included loci where individuals carrying the risk allele for CRP encounter higher lipid levels and risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, 5 regions (GCKR, PABPC4, BCL7B, FTO and TMEM18) had an effect on CRP largely mediated through the cardiometabolic phenotypes. In conclusion, our results show genetic pleiotropy among inflammation and cardiometabolic phenotypes. In addition to reverse causation, our data suggests that pleiotropic genetic variants partially underlie the association between CRP and cardiometabolic phenotypes.

25837654|t|Diabetic ketoacidosis in the setting of HNF1A-maturity onset diabetes of the young.
25837654|a|A female patient was treated for type 1 diabetes following presentation at 12 years of age with hyperglycaemia, polydipsia and weight loss. Eleven years later, while screening relatives attending a genetic diabetes clinic, she was identified as potentially harbouring a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) gene. Biochemical testing supported the diagnosis of HNF1A-maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and genetic screening was positive for a heterozygous mutation in the HNF1A gene. The patient transitioned from insulin to sulfonylurea therapy. Three years later, in the setting of poor metabolic control, the patient presented to the emergency department with a history of nausea, vomiting and palpitations. A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was confirmed and successfully treated. Although a diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY is rarely considered in a patient with a history of DKA, we demonstrate that DKA is possible in the setting of non-compliance with sulfonylurea therapy.

25896041|t|Low Frequencies of Autoimmunity-Associated PTPN22 Polymorphisms in MODY Patients, Including Those Transiently Expressing Islet Cell Autoantibodies.
25896041|a|BACKGROUND: The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), which is expressed primarily in lymphoid tissues. The functional but geographically highly variable PTPN22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), particularly c.1858C&gt;T, contribute to the onset and progression of autoimmunity-associated diseases and facilitate the expression of disease-associated autoantibodies. In Central Europe, 17-25% of patients with monogenic diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young, MODY) transiently express islet cell autoantibodies. METHODS: We addressed the links between the functional and geographically variable PTPN22 SNPs with MODY manifestation and the expression of islet cell autoantibodies in 276 MODY patients who originated from four regions (the Czech Republic, Israel, Japan and Brazil). RESULTS: The frequency of PTPN22 polymorphisms in the MODY patients was similar to those in geographically matched healthy populations, with the exception of c.788G&gt;A, the minor allele frequency of which was significantly elevated in the Czech hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) MODY patients [odds ratio (OR) 4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-10.7] and the Brazilian MODY patients (OR 8.4, 95% CI 1.8-39.1). A barely significant increase in the c.788G&gt;A minor allele was also detected in the islet cell autoantibody-positive Czech MODY patients. However, c.788A behaves as a loss-of-function mutant in T cells, and thus protects against autoimmunity. CONCLUSIONS: MODY patients (including islet cell autoantibody-positive cases) do not display any increase in autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 alleles. The absence of autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 alleles was also demonstrated in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, which suggests that the slow kinetics of the onset of autoantibodies is subject to a regulation that is different from that experienced in type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders.

25953829|t|Postprandial incretin and islet hormone responses and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 enzymatic activity in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young.
25953829|a|OBJECTIVE: The role of the incretin hormones in the pathophysiology of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is unclear. DESIGN: We studied the postprandial plasma responses of glucagon, incretin hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzymatic activity in patients with glucokinase (GCK) diabetes (MODY2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) diabetes (MODY3) as well as in matched healthy individuals (CTRLs). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with MODY2 (mean age +- S.E.M. 43 +- 5 years; BMI 24 +- 2 kg/m(2); fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 7.1 +- 0.3 mmol/l: HbA1c 6.6 +- 0.2%), ten patients with MODY3 (age 31 +- 3 years; BMI 24 +- 1 kg/m(2); FPG 8.9 +- 0.8 mmol/l; HbA1c 7.0 +- 0.3%) and ten CTRLs (age 40 +- 5 years; BMI 24 +- 1 kg/m(2); FPG 5.1 +- 0.1 mmol/l; HbA1c 5.3 +- 0.1%) were examined with a liquid test meal. RESULTS: All of the groups exhibited similar baseline values of glucagon (MODY2: 7 +- 1 pmol/l; MODY3: 6 +- 1 pmol/l; CTRLs: 8 +- 2 pmol/l, P=0.787), but patients with MODY3 exhibited postprandial hyperglucagonaemia (area under the curve (AUC) 838 +- 108 min x pmol/l) as compared to CTRLs (182 +- 176 min x pmol/l, P=0.005) and tended to have a greater response than did patients with MODY2 (410 +- 154 min x pmol/l, P=0.063). Similar peak concentrations and AUCs for plasma GIP and plasma GLP1 were observed across the groups. Increased fasting DPP4 activity was seen in patients with MODY3 (17.7 +- 1.2 mU/ml) vs CTRLs (13.6 +- 0.8 mU/ml, P=0.011), but the amount of activity was similar to that in patients with MODY2 (15.0 +- 0.7 mU/ml, P=0.133). CONCLUSION: The pathophysiology of MODY3 includes exaggerated postprandial glucagon responses and increased fasting DPP4 enzymatic activity but normal postprandial incretin responses both in patients with MODY2 and in patients with MODY3.

25987348|t|Circulating ghrelin level is higher in HNF1A-MODY and GCK-MODY than in polygenic forms of diabetes mellitus.
25987348|a|Ghrelin is a hormone that regulates appetite. It is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of varying forms of diabetes. In animal studies, the ghrelin expression was regulated by the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A). Mutations of the HNF1A gene cause maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We aimed to assess the circulating ghrelin levels in HNF1A-MODY and in other types of diabetes and to evaluate its association with HNF1A mutation status. Our cohort included 46 diabetic HNF1A gene mutation carriers, 55 type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects, 42 type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients, and 31 glucokinase (GCK) gene mutation carriers with diabetes as well as 51 healthy controls. Plasma ghrelin concentration was measured using the immunoenzymatic assay with polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal fragment of its acylated and desacylated forms. Ghrelin concentrations were 0.75 +- 0.32, 0.70 +- 0.21, 0.50 +- 0.20, and 0.40 +- 0.16 ng/ml in patients with HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, T1DM, and T2DM, respectively. The ghrelin levels were higher in HNF1A-MODY and GCK-MODY than in T1DM and T2DM (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons) but lower than in non-diabetic controls (1.02 +- 0.29 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001 for both comparisons). In the multivariate linear model, the differences between both MODY groups and common diabetes types remained significant. Analysis by a HNF1A mutation type indicated that ghrelin concentration is similar in patients with different types of sequence differences. Plasma ghrelin level is higher in HNF1A-MODY and GCK-MODY than in the common polygenic forms of diabetes.

26110317|t|MicroRNA-224 is Readily Detectable in Urine of Individuals with Diabetes Mellitus and is a Potential Indicator of Beta-Cell Demise.
26110317|a|MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of non-coding, 19-25 nucleotide RNA critical for network-level regulation of gene expression. miRNA serve as paracrine signaling molecules. Using an unbiased array approach, we previously identified elevated levels of miR-224 and miR-103 to be associated with a monogenic form of diabetes; HNF1A-MODY. miR-224 is a novel miRNA in the field of diabetes. We sought to explore the role of miR-224 as a potential biomarker in diabetes, and whether such diabetes-associated-miRNA can also be detected in the urine of patients. Absolute levels of miR-224 and miR-103 were determined in the urine of n = 144 individuals including carriers of a HNF1A mutation, participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normal controls. Expression levels were correlated with clinical and biochemical parameters. miR-224 was significantly elevated in the urine of carriers of a HNF1A mutation and participants with T1DM. miR-103 was highly expressed in urine across all diabetes cohorts when compared to controls. For both miR-224 and-103, we found a significant correlation between serum and urine levels (p &lt; 0.01). We demonstrate that miRNA can be readily detected in the urine independent of clinical indices of renal dysfunction. We surmise that the differential expression levels of miR-224 in both HNF1A-MODY mutation carriers and T1DM may be an attempt to compensate for beta-cell demise.

26226118|t|Molecular diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in Turkish children by using targeted next-generation sequencing.
26226118|a|AIM: To perform molecular analysis of pediatric maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) patients by next-generation sequencing, which enables simultaneous analysis of multiple genes in a single test, to determine the genetic etiology of a group of Turkish children clinically diagnosed as MODY, and to assess genotype-phenotype relationship. METHODS: Forty-two children diagnosed with MODY and their parents were enrolled in the study. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at the time of diagnosis were obtained from hospital records. Molecular analyses of GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, PDX1, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, and BLK genes were performed on genomic DNA by using next-generation sequencing. Pathogenicity for novel mutations was assessed by bioinformatics prediction software programs and segregation analyses. RESULTS: A mutation in MODY genes was identified in 12 (29%) of the cases. GCK mutations were detected in eight cases, and HNF1B, HNF1A, PDX1, and BLK mutations in the others. We identified five novel missense mutations - three in GCK (p.Val338Met, p.Cys252Ser, and p.Val86Ala), one in HNF1A (p.Cys241Ter), and one in PDX1 (p.Gly55Asp), which we believe to be pathogenic. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that mutations in the GCK gene are the leading cause of MODY in our population. Moreover, genetic diagnosis could be made in 29% of Turkish patients, and five novel mutations were identified.

26240958|t|Prevalence of Retinopathy in Adult Patients with GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY.
26240958|a|We aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in adult patients with GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY in Poland and to identify biochemical and clinical risk factors associated with its occurrence.We examined 74 GCK mutation carriers, 51 with diabetes and 23 with prediabetes, respectively, and 63 patients with HNF1A-MODY. Retinal photographs, 12 for each patient, were done by a fundus camera. Signs of DR were graded according to the DR disease severity scale. Statistical tests were performed to assess differences between the groups and logistic regression was done for the association with DR.The mean age at examination was 34.5+-14.8 and 39.9+-15.2 in the GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY groups, respectively. Mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR) was found in one patient with the GCK mutation and likely concomitant type 1 diabetes, whereas DR was diagnosed in 15 HNF1A-MODY patients: 9 with proliferative, 3 with moderate NPDR and 2 with mild NPDR. In univariate logistic regression analysis in the HNF1A-MODY group, significant results were found for diabetes duration, fasting glycemia, HbA1c, arterial hypertension, age at the examination, and eGFR. The strongest independent predictors of DR in HNF1A-MODY were markers of glucose control: HbA1c (OR: 2.05, CL%95: 1.2-3.83, p=0.01) and glucose (p=0.006, OR: 1.40, CL%95: 1.12-1.83) analyzed in 2 separated models. Additionally, arterial hypertension independently predicted DR (OR: 9.06, CL%95: 1.19-98.99, p=0.04) in the model with HbA1c as glycaemic control marker.In conclusion, DR of any degree was not present in our GCK-MODY group, while in spite of young age almost every fourth subject with HNF1A-MODY showed signs of this complication.

Among 4,908 Chinese T2D patients who were not taking lipid-lowering medications, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes previously found to be associated with lipid traits in genome-wide association studies conducted in populations of European ancestry (ABCA1, GCKR, BAZ1B, TOMM40, DOCK7, HNF1A, and HNF4A) were genotyped. After adjusting for multiple covariates, SNPs in ABCA1, GCKR, BAZ1B, TOMM40, and HNF1A were identified as significantly associated with triglyceride levels in T2D patients (P &lt; 0.05). The associations between the SNPs in ABCA1 (rs3890182), GCKR (rs780094), and BAZ1B (rs2240466) remained significant even after correction for multiple testing (P = 8.85x10(-3), 7.88x10(-7), and 2.03x10(-6), respectively). BAZ1B (rs2240466) also was associated with the total cholesterol level (P = 4.75x10(-2)). In addition, SNP rs157580 in TOMM40 was associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = 6.94x10(-3)). Our findings confirm that lipid-related genetic loci are associated with lipid profiles in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

26287533|t|Identification and Clinical Characterization of Adult Patients with Multigenerational Diabetes Mellitus.
26287533|a|BACKGROUND: Some patients diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are, instead, affected by multigenerational diabetes whose clinical characteristics are mostly undefined. OBJECTIVE: 1. To identify among patients who had been previously defined as affected by T2DM those, in fact, affected by multigenerational diabetes; 2. After excluding patients carrying the most common MODY genes and mitochondrial mutations, we compared clinical features of remaining patients with those of patients with T2DM. METHODS: Among 2,583 consecutive adult patients who had been defined as affected by T2DM, we looked for those with diabetes in &gt;=3 consecutive generations. All probands were screened for mutations in six MODY genes (HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B and NeuroD1) and for the A3243G mitochondrial mutation. After excluding patients with mutations in one of such genes, we compared clinical features of the remaining 67 patients (2.6% of the whole initial sample) affected by multigenerational "familial diabetes of the adulthood" (FDA) and of their diabetic relatives (n = 63) to those with T2DM (n = 1,028) by generalized hierarchical linear models followed by pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Age, age at diagnosis, proportion of hypertension (all p&lt;0.001), and waist circumference (p&lt;0.05) were lower in FDA than T2DM. Nonetheless, the two groups had similar age-adjusted incidence rate of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Beside younger age at diagnosis, FDA patients show lower waist circumference and reduced proportion of hypertension as compared to those with T2DM; despite such reduced potential cardiovascular risk factors, FDA patients did not show a reduced mortality risk than patients with T2DM.

26324089|t|Incretin hormones and maturity onset diabetes of the young--pathophysiological implications and anti-diabetic treatment potential.
26324089|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) designates monogenic forms of non-autoimmune diabetes characterised by autosomal dominant inheritance, non-insulin dependent diabetes at onset and diagnosis often before 25 years of age. MODY constitutes genetically and clinically heterogeneous forms of diabetes. More than 8 different genes are known to cause MODY, among which hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) (MODY3) and glucokinase (GCK) (MODY2) mutations are the most common. Both forms of MODY are characterised by specific beta cell dysfunction, with patients with HNF1A-diabetes having a reduced insulin secretory capacity, while patients with GCK-diabetes have a glucose-sensing defect, but preserved insulin secretory capacity. Patients with MODY are effectively treated with sulphonylurea (SU) due to very high sensitivity to these drugs, but they are also prone to develop hypoglycaemia. The objectives of this thesis were to study the pathophysiology of GCK-diabetes and HNF1A-diabetes by investigating the incretin effect, the physiological response to food ingestion and to estimate the treatment potential of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. In Study I we investigated the incretin effect and the responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and isoglycaemic IV glucose infusion (IIGI) in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A-diabetes, and in BMI and age matched healthy individuals (CTRLs). In Study II we investigated responses of islet hormones and incretin hormones to a more physiological stimulus consisting of a standardised meal test in patients with GCK-diabetes, in patients with HNF1A--diabetes, and in BMI and age matched CTRLs. In Study III we conducted a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial investigating the glucose lowering effect and risk of hypoglycaemia during 6 weeks of treatment with the GLP-1RA, liraglutide compared to the SU, glimepiride in 16 patients with HNF1A-diabetes. At baseline and at the end of each treatment period a standardised meal test followed by a light bicycling test was performed. The results of the studies showed that patients with HNF1A-diabetes were less glucose tolerant than patients with GCK-diabetes, but both groups were more glucose intolerant than CTRLs. In spite of glucose intolerance patients with GCK-diabetes showed normal incretin effect, whereas patients with HNF1A-diabetes showed an impaired incretin effect. Patients with HNF1A-diabetes were also characterised by an inappropriate insulin response. Normal insulin sensitivity was found in both groups of diabetes patients. In the prospective intervention trial a glucose lowering effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was demonstrated with both treatments without significant difference between the treatments. The postprandial plasma glucose responses were also lower with both glimepiride and liraglutide compared to baseline without significant difference between treatments. In spite of these findings glimepiride seems to have superior glucose lowering effects according to both FPG and postprandial glucose responses. Hypoglycaemic events (plasma glucose &lt;= 3.9 mM) occurred 18 times during glimepiride treatment and once during liraglutide treatment. No differences between treatments were demonstrated according to insulin and glucagon responses and gastric emptying, and counter-regulatory responses were preserved during both treatments. No effect of either treatment was seen on fructosamine or HbA1c. In conclusion, patients with GCK-diabetes show normal incretin and glucagon physiology, thus resembling healthy individuals, in spite of fasting hyperglycaemia and subtle glucose intolerance. In contrast, patients with HNF1A-diabetes exhibited noticeable glucose intolerance, beta cell dysfunction, impaired incretin effect, and inappropriate glucagon response to oral stimuli, hence resembling patients with type 2 diabetes. However, normal responses of incretin hormones and normal insulin sensitivity were found in patients with HNF1A-diabetes. Six weeks of treatment with glimepiride or liraglutide demonstrated glucose lowering effects. This effect was greater with glimepiride, although insignificant, but at the expense of a higher risk of hypoglycaemia (predominantly mild). GLP-1RAs may have a place in treatment of patients with HNF1A-diabetes, especially when hypoglycaemia is a problem. Future studies are required to clarify this.

26346360|a|A 19-year-old Japanese woman had been diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 9 years. She had a strong family history of diabetes, and genetic screening showed she had maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). Ultrasonography of the liver and magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple nodules consistent with hepatocellular adenoma (HA). Biopsy of the liver tumors revealed hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha-inactivated HA. HA is known as a MODY3-related disease due to mutations in HNF1alpha. We present the first report of HA associated with MODY3 in Japan.

26347889|t|Comparison of Glomerular Filtration Rate Estimation from Serum Creatinine and Cystatin C in HNF1A-MODY and Other Types of Diabetes.
26347889|a|INTRODUCTION: We previously showed that in HNF1A-MODY the cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimate is higher than the creatinine-based estimate. Currently, we aimed to replicate this finding and verify its clinical significance. METHODS: The study included 72 patients with HNF1A-MODY, 72 with GCK-MODY, 53 with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), 70 with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and 65 controls. Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured. GFR was calculated from creatinine and cystatin C using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation (eGRF-cr) and CKD-EPI cystatin C equation (eGFR-cys), respectively. RESULTS: Cystatin C levels were lower (p &lt; 0.001) in the control (0.70 +- 0.13 mg/L), HNF1A (0.75 +- 0.21), and GCK (0.72 +- 0.16 mg/L) groups in comparison to those with either T1DM (0.87 +- 0.15 mg/L) or T2DM (0.9 +- 0.23 mg/L). Moreover, eGFR-cys was higher than eGRF-cr in HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, and the controls (p = 0.004; p = 0.003; p &lt; 0.0001). This corresponded to 8.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, 9.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 16.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 of difference. Additionally, T1DM patients had higher eGFR-cr than eGFR-cys (11.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.0004); no difference occurred in T2DM (p = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that eGFR-cys values in HNF1A-MODY patients are higher compared to eGFR-cr. Some other differences were also described in diabetic groups. However, none of them appears to be clinically relevant.

26431509|t|High Incidence of Heterozygous ABCC8 and HNF1A Mutations in Czech Patients With Congenital Hyperinsulinism.
26431509|a|CONTEXT: Congenital hyperinsulinism of infancy (CHI) represents a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by oversecretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells causing severe hypoglycemia. OBJECTIVE: We studied the distribution of genetic causes of CHI in a Czech population. METHODS: Countrywide collection of patients with CHI included 40 subjects (12 females, median age of diagnosis, 1 wk [interquartile range, 1-612 wk]). We sequenced the ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, UCP2, SLC16A1, HNF4A, and HNF1A genes and investigated structural changes in the ABCC8 gene. We functionally tested novel variants in the ABCC8 gene by Rb(86+) efflux assay and novel variants in the HNF1A gene by transcriptional activation and DNA-binding tests. RESULTS: We found causal mutations in 20 subjects (50%): 19 carried a heterozygous mutation while one patient was homozygous for mutation in the ABCC8 gene. Specifically, we detected 11 mutations (seven novel) in ABCC8, one novel mutation in KCNJ11, five mutations (two novel) in HNF1A, two novel mutations in HNF4A, and one in GCK. We showed a decrease of activation by diazoxide in mutant KATP channels with novel ABCC8 variants by 41-91% (median, 82%) compared with wild-type (WT) channels and reduced transcriptional activity of mutant HNF1A proteins (2.9% for p.Asn62Lysfs93* and 22% for p.Leu254Gln) accompanied by no DNA-binding ability compared with WT HNF1A. CONCLUSION: We detected a higher proportion of heterozygous mutations causing CHI compared with other cohorts probably due to lack of consanguinity and inclusion of milder CHI forms. Interestingly, HNF1A gene mutations represented the second most frequent genetic cause of CHI in the Czech Republic. Based on our results we present a genetic testing strategy specific for similar populations.

26479152|t|Successful maintenance on sulphonylurea therapy and low diabetes complication rates in a HNF1A-MODY cohort.
26479152|a|AIMS: HNF1A gene mutations are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in the UK. Persons with HNF1A-MODY display sensitivity to sulphonylurea therapy; however, the long-term efficacy is not established. There is limited literature as to the prevalence of micro- and macrovascular complications in this unique cohort. The aim of this study was to determine the natural progression and clinical management of HNF1A-MODY diabetes in a dedicated MODY clinic. METHODS: Sixty patients with HNF1A-MODY and a cohort of 60 BMI-, age-, ethnicity- and diabetes duration-matched patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus participated in the study. All patients were phenotyped in detail. Clinical follow-up of the HNF1A-MODY cohort occurred on a bi-annual basis. RESULTS: Following a genetic diagnosis of MODY, the majority of the cohort treated with sulphonylurea therapy remained insulin independent at 84-month follow-up (80%). The HbA1c in the HNF1A-MODY group treated with sulphonylurea therapy alone improved significantly over the study period [from 49 (44-63) mmol/mol, 6.6 (6.2-7.9)% to 41 (31-50) mmol/mol, 5.9 (5-6.7)%; P = 0.003]. The rate of retinopathy was significantly lower than that noted in the Type 1 diabetes mellitus group (13.6 vs. 50%; P = 0.0001).There was also a lower rate of microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease in the HNF1A-MODY group compared with the Type 1 diabetes mellitus group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of patients with HNF1A-MODY can be maintained successfully on sulphonylurea therapy with good glycaemic control. We note a significantly lower rate of micro- and macrovascular complications than reported previously. The use of appropriate therapy at early stages of the disorder may decrease the incidence of complications.

26524290|t|A candidate-gene association study of topiramate-induced weight loss in obese patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
26524290|a|OBJECTIVE: Clinical response to topiramate can vary greatly in obese patients. Identifying genetic variants associated with treatment response could help gain insight into the mechanism of action of topiramate. Little is known about the relationship between genetic variability and topiramate treatment response. We performed a large-scale candidate-gene study to identify genetic risk factors predictive of topiramate-induced weight loss. METHODS: We collected DNA samples from patients who had previously participated in clinical trials to assess the efficacy of topiramate for the treatment of obesity. A custom chip containing single nucleotide polymorphisms from ~ 480 candidate genes was utilized to genotype a discovery cohort of 445 obese patients from a clinical study. Variants predictive of topiramate-induced weight loss were identified and further tested in an independent replication cohort of drug-naive, obese patients with type 2 diabetes (N=139). RESULTS: We identified a haplotype in INSR that may contribute to differential topiramate-induced weight loss. Carriers and noncarriers of an INSR haplotype lost 9.1 and 7.0% of body weight, respectively (P = 6.5 x 10(-6), P adj = 0.001). This finding was replicated, with carriers and noncarriers losing 9.5 and 7.3% of body weight, respectively (P Bonf=0.02), in the independent replication cohort. We also identified an SNP in HNF1A that may be associated with topiramate response and an SNP in GRIA3 that may be associated with nonpharmacologic treatment response. CONCLUSION: According to our preliminary findings, genetic variation in the INSR and HNF1A genes may differentially affect weight loss in obese individuals treated with topiramate and genes related to insulin action are implicated in modulating topiramate response. However, these findings need to be further replicated in additional larger samples.

26552609|t|Genetic testing for monogenic diabetes using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
26552609|a|INTRODUCTION: Molecular diagnosis of monogenic diabetes mellitus is important for individualized patient care. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables a simultaneous analysis of multiple genes in a single test. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the feasibility of using NGS for detecting mutations in a set of known monogenic diabetes gene mutations in a cohort of Polish patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) with earlier negative Sanger sequencing results for HNF1A-MODY or GCK-MODY. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected a panel of 28 chromosomal genes in which mutations have been reported to cause monogenic diabetes. The MiSeq platform was used for NGS. An exon-capture assay was designed to include coding regions and splice sites. A total of 54 patients with existing negative Sanger sequencing screening results for HNF1A or GCK gene mutations were selected for the study. RESULTS: NGS results were generated for all 54 patients and 9 positive controls with previously identified HNF1A or GCK gene mutation. All selected positive controls were confirmed by NGS. Among 28 genes, mutations were detected in 16. The type of the analyzed genetic changes was described in the NGS study as high (n = 3) or moderate (n = 76). Among the detected mutations, there were 4 known GCK gene mutations that had been previously missed in Sanger sequencing. So far, Sanger sequencing allowed us to confirm 21 gene mutations detected by NGS, and segregation with diabetes in 14 pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study using NGS for monogenic diabetes screening in the MODY cohort confirmed that it improves the detection of diabetes-related sequence differences. The screening with NGS should also include diabetic patients for whom Sanger-based screening for particular subtypes of MODY provided negative results.

26641800|t|Substantial proportion of MODY among multiplex families participating in a Type 1 diabetes prediction programme.
26641800|a|AIMS: Patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) might be over-represented in families with histories of Type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to re-evaluate families participating in the Czech T1D Prediction Programme (PREDIA.CZ) with at least two members affected with diabetes to assess the proportion of MODY among these families and determine its most significant clinical predictors. METHODS: Of the 557 families followed up by the PREDIA.CZ, 53 (9.5%) had two or more family members with diabetes. One proband with diabetes from these families was chosen for direct sequencing of the GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A and INS genes. Non-parametric tests and a linear logistic regression model were used to evaluate differences between MODY and non-MODY families. RESULTS: MODY was genetically diagnosed in 24 of the 53 families with multiple occurrences of diabetes (45%). Mutations were detected most frequently in GCK (58%), followed by HNF1A (38%) and INS (4%). MODY families were more likely to have a parent with diabetes and had a higher proportion of females with diabetes than non-MODY families. Higher age (P &lt; 0.001), a lower level of HbA1c (P &lt; 0.001) at clinical onset and at least two generations affected by diabetes were the variables most predictive for probands of MODY families already presenting with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: A prediction programme for Type 1 diabetes would provide a useful new source of patients with MODY most likely to benefit from an accurate diagnosis. This identification has implications for patient treatment and disease prognosis.

26669242|t|Maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY) in Turkish children: sequence analysis of 11 causative genes by next generation sequencing.
26669242|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the youth (MODY), is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of diseasesand is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study is to investigate both novel and proven mutations of 11 MODY genes in Turkish children by using targeted next generation sequencing. METHODS: A panel of 11 MODY genes were screened in 43 children with MODY diagnosed by clinical criterias. Studies of index cases was done with MISEQ-ILLUMINA, and family screenings and confirmation studies of mutations was done by Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 28 (65%) point mutations among 43 patients. Eighteen patients have GCK mutations, four have HNF1A, one has HNF4A, one has HNF1B, two have NEUROD1, one has PDX1 gene variations and one patient has both HNF1A and HNF4A heterozygote mutations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study including molecular studies of 11 MODY genes in Turkish children. GCK is the most frequent type of MODY in our study population. Very high frequency of novel mutations (42%) in our study population, supports that in heterogenous disorders like MODY sequence analysis provides rapid, cost effective and accurate genetic diagnosis.

26773576|t|A family with the Arg103Pro mutation in the NEUROD1 gene detected by next-generation sequencing - Clinical characteristics of mutation carriers.
26773576|a|UNLABELLED: Until now only a few families with early onset autosomal diabetes due to the NEUROD1 gene mutations have been identified. Moreover, only some of them meet strict MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young) criteria. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an opportunity to detect more pathogenic mutations in this gene. Here, we evaluated the segregation of the Arg103Pro mutation in the NEUROD1 gene in a pedigree in which it was detected, and described the clinical characteristics of the mutation carriers. METHODS: We included 156 diabetic probands of MODY families, among them 52 patients earlier tested for GCK-MODY and/or HNF1A-MODY by Sanger sequencing with negative results. Genetic testing was performed by targeted NGS sequencing using a panel of 28 monogenic diabetes genes. RESULTS: As detected by NGS, one patient had the missense Arg103Pro (CGC/CCC) mutation in the gene NEUROD1 changing the amino-acid structure of the DNA binding domain of this transcription factor. We confirmed this sequence difference by Sanger sequencing. This family had previously been tested with negative results for HNF1A gene mutations. 17 additional members of this family were invited for further testing. We confirmed the presence of the mutation in 11 subjects. Seven adult mutation carriers (all but one) from three generations had been already diagnosed with diabetes. There were 3 individuals with the Arg103Pro mutation diagnosed before the age of 30 years in the family. The range of age of the four unaffected mutation carriers (3 minors and 1 adult) was 3-48 years. Interestingly, one mutation carrier had a history of transient neonatal hypoglycemia, of which the clinical course resembled episodes typical for HNF4A-MODY. CONCLUSIONS: We report a family with autosomal dominant diabetes related to a new NEUROD1 mutation, one of very few meeting MODY criteria. The use of the NGS method will facilitate identification of more families with rare forms of MODY.

26802434|t|Personalized medicine in diabetes: the role of 'omics' and biomarkers.
26802434|a|Personalized medicine, otherwise called stratified or precision medicine, aims to better target intervention to the individual to maximize benefit and minimize harm. This review discusses how diabetes aetiology, pathophysiology and patient genotype influence response to or side effects of the commonly used diabetes treatments. C-peptide is a useful biomarker that is underused to guide treatment choice, severe insulin deficiency predicts non-response to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones are more effective in insulin-resistant patients. The field of pharmacogenetics is now yielding clinically important results, with three examples outlined: sulphonylurea sensitivity in patients with HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young; sulphonylurea sensitivity in patients with Type 2 diabetes with reduced function alleles at CYP2C9, resulting in reduced metabolism of sulphonylureas; and severe metformin intolerance associated with reduced function organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) variants, exacerbated by drugs that also inhibit OCT1. Genome-wide approaches and the potential of other 'omics', including metagenomics and metabolomics, are then outlined, highlighting the complex interacting networks that we need to understand before we can truly personalize diabetes treatments.

26853433|t|Structure-function studies of HNF1A (MODY3) gene mutations in South Indian patients with monogenic diabetes.
26853433|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic form of diabetes characterized by onset of diabetes below 25 years of age, autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and primary defect in insulin secretion. Mutations in the gene (HNF1A) encoding transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF-1A) results in one of the most common forms of MODY (MODY3). HNF-1A is mainly enriched in pancreatic beta-cells and hepatocytes and important for organ development and normal pancreatic function. We here report on the functional interrogation of eight missense HNF1A mutations associated with MODY3 in South Indian subjects, and the contributing effect of common variant (S487N) within HNF1A. Of the eight mutations, three mutations (p.R171G, p.G245R and p.R263H), in particular, affected HNF-1A function in transfected HeLa cells by reducing both transcriptional activity and nuclear localization, possibly due to disruption of the integrity of the three dimensional structure. The common variant p.S487N contributed further to the loss-of-function of p.R271Q (p.R271Q+p.S487N double mutant), in vitro, on both activity and localization. Our data on the first functional study of HNF1A mutations in South India subjects confers that the defect of the HNF-1A mutant proteins are responsible for MODY3 diabetes in these patients.

26855178|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 coordinates multiple processes in a model of intestinal epithelial cell function.
26855178|a|Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 transcription factors (HNF1alpha/beta) are associated with diabetes. These factors are well studied in the liver, pancreas and kidney, where they direct tissue-specific gene regulation. However, they also have an important role in the biology of many other tissues, including the intestine. We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network. These data suggest that HNF1 plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function, both directly and through interactions with other intestinal transcription factors.

26876668|t|Early Developmental Perturbations in a Human Stem Cell Model of MODY5/HNF1B Pancreatic Hypoplasia.
26876668|a|Patients with an HNF1B(S148L/+) mutation (MODY5) typically exhibit pancreatic hypoplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms are unknown due to inaccessibility of patient material and because mouse models do not fully recapitulate MODY5. Here, we differentiated MODY5 human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into pancreatic progenitors, and show that the HNF1B(S148L/+) mutation causes a compensatory increase in several pancreatic transcription factors, and surprisingly, a decrease in PAX6 pancreatic gene expression. The lack of suppression of PDX1, PTF1A, GATA4, and GATA6 indicates that MODY5-mediated pancreatic hypoplasia is mechanistically independent. Overexpression studies demonstrate that a compensatory increase in PDX1 gene expression is due to mutant HNF1B(S148L/+) but not wild-type HNF1B or HNF1A. Furthermore, HNF1B does not appear to directly regulate PAX6 gene expression necessary for glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate compensatory mechanisms in the pancreatic transcription factor network due to mutant HNF1B(S148L/+) protein. Thus, patients typically develop MODY5 but not neonatal diabetes despite exhibiting pancreatic hypoplasia.

26942212|t|Assessment of Newly Proposed Clinical Criteria to Identify HNF1A MODY in Patients with an Initial Diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
26942212|a|The most common form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) gene. However, most HNF1A mutation-carriers are initially misdiagnosed with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus; hence, they often receive nonoptimal treatment. The aim of our study was to test newly proposed clinical criteria for the identification of HNF1A MODY in patients with a diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM. To achieve this, the following criteria to preselect patients for screening were used: for T1DM: TDIR (total daily insulin requirement) &gt; 0.3 IU of insulin/kg and the percentage of basal insulin &gt; 30% of TDIR; for T2DM: sulphonylurea- (SU-) based oral treatment (monotherapy or combined with Metformin) &gt; 15 years and BMI &lt; 30 kg/m(2). We reviewed the clinical data of 140 patients with T1DM and 524 clinically diagnosed with T2DM. On the basis of these criteria, we found a HNF1A mutation in 1 out of 2 individuals with a diagnosis of T1DM and 1 out of 11 selected individuals with a diagnosis of T2DM. We believe that the simplicity of the proposed criteria might prove useful in clinical practice, as an alternative to more time-consuming classical diagnostic techniques.

26981542|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is characterized by the onset of diabetes before the age of 25 years, positive family history, high genetic predisposition, monogenic mutations, and an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Here, we aimed to investigate the mutations and to characterize the phenotypes of a Han Chinese family with early-onset maternally inherited type 2 diabetes. Detailed clinical assessments and genetic screening for mutations in the HNF4alpha, GCK, HNF-1alpha, IPF-1, HNF1beta, and NEUROD1 genes were carried out in this family. One HNF4A mutation (p.T130I) and two HNF1A polymorphisms (p.I27L and p.S487N) were identified. Mutation p.T130I was associated with both early-onset and late-onset diabetes and caused downregulated HNF4A expression, whereas HNF1A polymorphisms p.I27L and p.S487N were associated with the age of diagnosis of diabetes. We demonstrated that mutation p.T130I in HNF4A was pathogenic as were the predicted polymorphisms p.I27L and p.S487N in HNF1A by genetic and functional analysis. Our results show that mutations in HNF4A and HNF1A genes might account for this early-onset inherited type 2 diabetes.

26997508|t|A dizygotic twin pregnancy in a MODY 3-affected woman.
26997508|a|BACKGROUND: MODY diabetes includes rare familiar forms due to genetic mutations resulting in beta-cell dysfunction. MODY 3 is due to mutations in the gene transcription factor HNF-1alpha, with diabetes diagnosis in adolescence or early adult life. Few data are available about MODY 3 in pregnancy. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old Italian woman came to our unit at the 5th week of pregnancy. She was diagnosed with diabetes at 18 years, with negative autoimmunity and a strong familiarity for diabetes. She was treated with gliclazide and metformin. She had a previous pregnancy in which she was treated with insulin, giving birth at 38 weeks to a 3.210 kg baby girl, who showed neonatal hypoglycemia. We switched her to insulin treatment according to guidelines. We asked for genetic molecular testing, resulting in a HNF-1alpha gene mutation. A US examination at 7 weeks revealed a twin, bicorial, biamniotic pregnancy. At 37 weeks of gestation, she gave birth to two normal-weight baby girls; only one showed neonatal hypoglycemia and a genetic test revealed that she was affected by HNF-1alpha gene mutation. Subsequently, entire family of the woman was tested, showing that the father, the sister and the first daughter had the same HNF-1alpha mutation. DISCUSSION: A MODY 3 foetus needs a near-normal maternal glycemic control, because the exposure to intrauterine hyperglycemia can lead to an earlier age of diabetes onset. Neonatal hypoglycemia is generally observed in MODY 1 infants, but it is possible to hypothesize that some HNF-1alpha mutations could lead to a functionally impaired protein that might dysregulate HNF-4alpha expression determining hypoglycemia.

27059371|t|Differential regulation of serum microRNA expression by HNF1beta and HNF1alpha transcription factors.
27059371|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) under transcriptional control of the HNF1beta transcription factor, and investigate whether its effect manifests in serum. METHODS: The Polish cohort (N = 60) consisted of 11 patients with HNF1B-MODY, 17 with HNF1A-MODY, 13 with GCK-MODY, an HbA1c-matched type 1 diabetic group (n = 9) and ten healthy controls. Replication was performed in 61 clinically-matched British patients mirroring the groups in the Polish cohort. The Polish cohort underwent miRNA serum level profiling with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) arrays to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Validation was performed using qPCR. To determine whether serum content reflects alterations at a cellular level, we quantified miRNA levels in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) with small interfering RNA knockdowns of HNF1alpha or HNF1beta. RESULTS: Significant differences (adjusted p &lt; 0.05) were noted for 11 miRNAs. Five of them differed between HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, and, amongst those, four (miR-24, miR-27b, miR-223 and miR-199a) showed HNF1B-MODY-specific expression levels in the replication group. In all four cases the miRNA expression level was lower in HNF1B-MODY than in all other tested groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.79 to 0.86, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 91.7% (miR-24) and 82.1% (miR-199a), respectively. The cellular expression pattern of miRNA was consistent with serum levels, as all were significantly higher in HNF1alpha- than in HNF1beta-deficient HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have shown that expression of specific miRNAs depends on HNF1beta function. The impact of HNF1beta deficiency was evidenced at serum level, making HNF1beta-dependent miRNAs potentially applicable in the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY.

27062931|t|Pharmacogenomics in diabetes mellitus: insights into drug action and drug discovery.
27062931|a|Genomic studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the multifactorial aetiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as the multiple subtypes of monogenic diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we discuss the existing pharmacogenetic evidence in both monogenic diabetes mellitus and T2DM. We highlight mechanistic insights from the study of adverse effects and the efficacy of antidiabetic drugs. The identification of extreme sulfonylurea sensitivity in patients with diabetes mellitus owing to heterozygous mutations in HNF1A represents a clear example of how pharmacogenetics can direct patient care. However, pharmacogenomic studies of response to antidiabetic drugs in T2DM has yet to be translated into clinical practice, although some moderate genetic effects have now been described that merit follow-up in trials in which patients are selected according to genotype. We also discuss how future pharmacogenomic findings could provide insights into treatment response in diabetes mellitus that, in addition to other areas of human genetics, facilitates drug discovery and drug development for T2DM.

27065949|t|Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia - The Molecular Mechanisms.
27065949|a|Under normal physiological conditions, pancreatic beta-cells secrete insulin to maintain fasting blood glucose levels in the range 3.5-5.5 mmol/L. In hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH), this precise regulation of insulin secretion is perturbed so that insulin continues to be secreted in the presence of hypoglycemia. HH may be due to genetic causes (congenital) or secondary to certain risk factors. The molecular mechanisms leading to HH involve defects in the key genes regulating insulin secretion from the beta-cells. At this moment, in time genetic abnormalities in nine genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GCK, SCHAD, GLUD1, SLC16A1, HNF1A, HNF4A, and UCP2) have been described that lead to the congenital forms of HH. Perinatal stress, intrauterine growth retardation, maternal diabetes mellitus, and a large number of developmental syndromes are also associated with HH in the neonatal period. In older children and adult's insulinoma, non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome and post bariatric surgery are recognized causes of HH. This review article will focus mainly on describing the molecular mechanisms that lead to unregulated insulin secretion.

27083284|t|Tubular proteinuria in patients with HNF1alpha mutations: HNF1alpha drives endocytosis in the proximal tubule.
27083284|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is a transcription factor expressed in the liver, pancreas, and proximal tubule of the kidney. Mutations of HNF1alpha cause an autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus (MODY-HNF1A) and tubular dysfunction. To gain insights into the role of HNF1alpha in the proximal tubule, we analyzed Hnf1a-deficient mice. Compared with wild-type littermates, Hnf1a knockout mice showed low-molecular-weight proteinuria and a 70% decrease in the uptake of beta2-microglobulin, indicating a major endocytic defect due to decreased expression of megalin/cubilin receptors. We identified several binding sites for HNF1alpha in promoters of Lrp2 and Cubn genes encoding megalin and cubilin, respectively. The functional interaction of HNF1alpha with these promoters was shown in C33 epithelial cells lacking endogenous HNF1alpha. Defective receptor-mediated endocytosis was confirmed in proximal tubule cells from these knockout mice and could be rescued by transfection of wild-type but not mutant HNF1alpha. Transfection of human proximal tubule HK2 cells with HNF1alpha was able to upregulate megalin and cubilin expression and to increase endocytosis of albumin. Low-molecular-weight proteinuria was consistently detected in individuals with HNF1A mutations compared with healthy controls and patients with non-MODY-HNF1A diabetes mellitus. Thus, HNF1alpha plays a key role in the constitutive expression of megalin and cubilin, hence regulating endocytosis in the proximal tubule of the kidney. These findings provide new insight into the renal phenotype of individuals with mutations of HNF1A.

27087001|t|The Metabolic Phenotype of Youth Onset Type 2 Diabetes: The Role of Pregestational Diabetes Exposure and the Hepatic Nuclear Factor 1Alpha G319S Polymorphism.
27087001|a|INTRODUCTION: The influence of exposure to diabetes in utero and the HNF-1alpha G319S polymorphism on the metabolic phenotype of youth with T2DM at diagnosis is unknown. The objective of this study is to describe the metabolic phenotype at diagnosis of youth with T2DM: a) by exposure to gestational or pregestational diabetes and b) by HNF-1alpha G319S genotype. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective chart review of youth with T2DM diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 seen at a single centre was performed. The primary variables of interest and selected clinical and biochemical characteristics at birth and at diagnosis of diabetes were extracted. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four youth were included. Youth exposed to pregestational diabetes were younger at diagnosis (-1.26 years, p&lt;0.001), had a shorter gestation (-1.73 weeks, p&lt;0.001) and a lower waist z-score (-2.77, p&lt;0.001) compared to those not exposed to diabetes in utero. Youth homozygous for the HNF-1alpha G319S polymorphism were younger (-1.77 years p&lt;0.001), had a lower BMI z-score (-0.32, p=0.04), waist z-score (-1.91, p=0.04), HbA1c (-1.73%; 18.9 mmol/mol, p&lt;0.01), triglycerides (-90.3 mg/dl; -1.02 mmol/L, p=0.04) and higher HDL-c (8.88 mg/dl; 0.23 mmol/L, p=0.001) compared to wild-type youth at diagnosis. Homozygote youth were less likely to have hypertension or acanthosis nigricans at diagnosis (OR 0.27, p=0.03; OR 0.32, p=0.04 respectively). CONCLUSION: Differences in the metabolic phenotype of subgroups of youth with T2DM suggest differences in the pathophysiology of diabetes. An understanding of specific phenotypes is necessary to plan and inform both prevention and intervention strategies.

27103109|t|Searching for Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY): When and What for?
27103109|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a group of monogenic diseases that results in primary defects in insulin secretion and dominantly inherited forms of nonautoimmune diabetes. Although many genes may be associated with monogenic diabetes, heterozygous mutations in 6 of them are responsible for the majority of cases of MODY. Glucokinase (GCK)-MODY is due to mutations in the glucokinase gene, 3 MODY subtypes are associated with mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) transcription factors, and 2 others with mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the subunits of the ATP-dependent potassium channel in pancreatic beta cells. GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY are the most common subtypes. The clinical presentation of MODY subtypes has been reported to differ according to the gene involved, and the diagnosis of MODY may be considered in various clinical circumstances. However, except in patients with GCK-MODY whose phenotype is very homogeneous, in most cases the penetrance and expressivity of a given molecular abnormality vary greatly among patients and, conversely, alterations in various genes may lead to similar phenotypes. Moreover, differential diagnosis among more common forms of diabetes may be difficult, particularly with type 2 diabetes. Thus, careful assessment of the personal and family histories of patients with diabetes is mandatory to select those in whom genetic screening is worthwhile. The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes has many consequences in terms of prognosis, therapeutics and family screening.

27111117|t|Complex Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes and Effect Size: What have We Learned from Isolated Populations?
27111117|a|Genetic studies in large outbred populations have documented a complex, highly polygenic basis for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Most of the variants currently known to be associated with T2D risk have been identified in large studies that included tens of thousands of individuals who are representative of a single major ethnic group such as European, Asian, or African. However, most of these variants have only modest effects on the risk for T2D; identification of definitive 'causal variant' or 'causative loci' is typically lacking. Studies in isolated populations offer several advantages over outbred populations despite being, on average, much smaller in sample size. For example, reduced genetic variability, enrichment of rare variants, and a more uniform environment and lifestyle, which are hallmarks of isolated populations, can reduce the complexity of identifying disease-associated genes. To date, studies in isolated populations have provided valuable insight into the genetic basis of T2D by providing both a deeper understanding of previously identified T2D-associated variants (e.g. demonstrating that variants in KCNQ1 have a strong parent-of-origin effect) or providing novel variants (e.g. ABCC8 in Pima Indians, TBC1D4 in the Greenlandic population, HNF1A in Canadian Oji-Cree). This review summarizes advancements in genetic studies of T2D in outbred and isolated populations, and provides information on whether the difference in the prevalence of T2D in different populations (Pima Indians vs. non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Whites vs. non-Hispanic Blacks) can be explained by the difference in risk allele frequencies of established T2D variants.

27142837|t|Divergent phenotypes in siblings with identical novel mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene leading to maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3.
27142837|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in at least 13 different genes. The hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene is affected in the most common form (HNF1A-MODY [MODY3]). CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the co-inheritance of a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1761C &gt; G (p.Pro588Ala) with a novel complex deletion insertion mutation (c.1765_1766delinsGCCCGfs86*) in the HNF-1alpha gene among affected members of one family. Both mutations were present in the affected patients and neither was present in unaffected family members. The family had not only inheritance of MODY but also increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Therefore one family member had classical type 2 diabetes including metabolic syndrome aggravated by a genetic predisposition in the form of HNF1A-MODY. CONCLUSION: The presence of common type 2 diabetes features should not detract from the possibility of MODY in patients with a striking autosomal-dominant family history.

27188453|t|Clinical and genetic characterization of congenital hyperinsulinism in Spain.
27188453|a|CONTEXT: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by severe hypoglycemia caused by inappropriate insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinically and genetically CHI patients in Spain. DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 50 patients with CHI from Spain. Clinical information was provided by the referring clinicians. Mutational analysis was carried out for KCNJ11, ABCC8, and GCK genes. The GLUD1, HNF4A, HNF1A, UCP2, and HADH genes were sequenced depending on the clinical phenotype. RESULTS: We identified the genetic etiology in 28 of the 50 CHI patients tested: 21 had a mutation in KATP channel genes (42%), three in GLUD1 (6%), and four in GCK (8%). Most mutations were found in ABCC8 (20/50). Half of these patients (10/20) were homozygous or compound heterozygous, with nine being unresponsive to diazoxide treatment. The other half had heterozygous mutations in ABCC8, six of them being unresponsive to diazoxide treatment and four being responsive to diazoxide treatment. We identified 22 different mutations in the KATP channel genes, of which ten were novel. Notably, patients with ABCC8 mutations were diagnosed earlier, with lower blood glucose levels and required higher doses of diazoxide than those without a genetic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic analysis revealed mutations in 56% of the CHI patients. ABCC8 mutations are the most frequent cause of CHI in Spain. We found ten novel mutations in the KATP channel genes. The genetic diagnosis is more likely to be achieved in patients with onset within the first week of life and in those who fail to respond to diazoxide treatment.

27271189|t|Systematic Population Screening, Using Biomarkers and Genetic Testing, Identifies 2.5% of the U.K. Pediatric Diabetes Population With Monogenic Diabetes.
27271189|a|OBJECTIVE: Monogenic diabetes is rare but is an important diagnosis in pediatric diabetes clinics. These patients are often not identified as this relies on the recognition of key clinical features by an alert clinician. Biomarkers (islet autoantibodies and C-peptide) can assist in the exclusion of patients with type 1 diabetes and allow systematic testing that does not rely on clinical recognition. Our study aimed to establish the prevalence of monogenic diabetes in U.K. pediatric clinics using a systematic approach of biomarker screening and targeted genetic testing. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 808 patients (79.5% of the eligible population) &lt;20 years of age with diabetes who were attending six pediatric clinics in South West England and Tayside, Scotland. Endogenous insulin production was measured using the urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio (UCPCR). C-peptide-positive patients (UCPCR &gt;=0.2 nmol/mmol) underwent islet autoantibody (GAD and IA2) testing, with patients who were autoantibody negative undergoing genetic testing for all 29 identified causes of monogenic diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 2.5% of patients (20 of 808 patients) (95% CI 1.6-3.9%) had monogenic diabetes (8 GCK, 5 HNF1A, 4 HNF4A, 1 HNF1B, 1 ABCC8, 1 INSR). The majority (17 of 20 patients) were managed without insulin treatment. A similar proportion of the population had type 2 diabetes (3.3%, 27 of 808 patients). CONCLUSIONS: This large systematic study confirms a prevalence of 2.5% of patients with monogenic diabetes who were &lt;20 years of age in six U.K. clinics. This figure suggests that ~50% of the estimated 875 U.K. pediatric patients with monogenic diabetes have still not received a genetic diagnosis. This biomarker screening pathway is a practical approach that can be used to identify pediatric patients who are most appropriate for genetic testing.

27323672|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young: Seek and you will find.
27323672|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic, autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterised by mutations in genes resulting in dysfunction of pancreatic beta-cells and subsequent insulin production. We present a family with HNF1A-MODY due to a likely pathogenic mutation in HNF1A (c.59G&gt;A, p.Gly20Glu), diagnosed a long time after the first diagnosis of diabetes. Currently 13 MODY subtypes caused by mutations in 13 genes, are known. We describe the four most prevalent forms in more detail, i.e. HNF4A-MODY, GCK-MODY, HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, together responsible for probably 99% of MODY cases. The different forms of MODY vary in prevalence, severity of diabetes, occurrence and severity of diabetic complications and response to treatment. New tools, such as the MODY probability calculator, may be of assistance in finding those patients in whom further genetic testing for possible MODY is warranted. However, as our described family shows, a doctor's clinical eye and taking the time for a detailed family history may be equal to, or even better than, the best prediction rule.

27398945|t|Identification of monogenic gene mutations in Japanese subjects diagnosed with type 1B diabetes between &gt;5 and 15.1 years of age.
27398945|a|BACKGROUND: Monogenic mutations, such as those in the potassium inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) and insulin (INS) genes, are identified in young patients with type 1B diabetes (non-autoimmune-mediated). We recently reported the results of a test for monogenic forms of diabetes in Japanese children who were diagnosed with type 1B diabetes at &lt;5 years of age. In this study, we tested for monogenic forms of diabetes in Japanese children aged &gt;5 to &lt;=15.1 years at the diagnosis of type 1B diabetes. METHODS: Thirty-two Japanese children (eight males, 24 females) with type 1 diabetes negative for glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and/or IA-2A autoantibodies and who were aged &gt;5 to 15.1 years at diagnosis were recruited from 16 independent hospitals participating in the Japanese Study Group of Insulin Therapy for Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes (JSGIT). We performed mutational analyses of genes with a high frequency of mutation [INS, KCNJ11, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha)]. RESULTS: We identified one missense mutation (G32S) in the INS gene and two mutations (R131Q and R203S) in the HNF1alpha gene that could be associated with diabetes. No missense change was found in the KCNJ11 gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although mutations in the INS gene can be detected in Japanese patients aged &gt;5 years at diagnosis, the frequency of mutations decrease in older age groups. Conversely, the frequency of the mutation in the HNF1alpha gene increased in patients diagnosed at age 5 or older. Clinicians should consider the possibility of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in children diagnosed with type 1B diabetes.

27420379|t|A preliminary study to evaluate the strategy of combining clinical criteria and next generation sequencing (NGS) for the identification of monogenic diabetes among multi-ethnic Asians.
27420379|a|AIMS: Diabetes is increasing globally and Asia is the epicenter. Among those with young-onset diabetes (&lt;45years), the prevalence of monogenic diabetes is estimated to be non-trivial (~5%). An accurate diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is important to inform treatment, prognosis and genetic counseling. Therefore, a robust clinical algorithm to identify probands for testing is needed. Our aims are (1) to select probands for genetic testing and variant identification based on their clinical phenotype and (2) to evaluate the MODY probability calculator in our multi-ethnic Asian population. METHODS: Eighty-four potential probands, identified in accordance with clinical practice guidelines, were subjected to re-sequencing of 16 monogenic diabetes genes and targeted genotyping for mitochondrial 3243A&gt;G point-mutation. Variants, confirmed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing, were classified as pathogenic if they fulfilled the criteria adapted from American College of Medical Genetics. Performance of MODY calculator (with positive-predictive threshold set at &gt;62.4%) for those with diabetes-onset &lt;=35years (data input-limit) (n=71) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects (15.5%) harbored likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants: 6 (2 novel) in HNF1A (1 subject concomitantly had another HNF4A variant), 1 in HNF4A, 2 in mt3243A&gt;G and 1 each in GCK, KCNJ11 (novel), ABCC8 (novel) and PAX4 (novel). Performance of the MODY calculator was: sensitivity 0.769, specificity 0.603 and negative predictive value 0.921. When analysis was restricted to MODY1-3, the performance was: 0.875, 0.587 and 0.974, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MODY is non-trivial (~15%) among Asians with young-onset diabetes. MODY calculator performs well in our population in nominating probands for genetic testing.

27432078|t|Treating young adults with type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes.
27432078|a|It is increasingly recognised that diabetes in young adults has a wide differential diagnosis. There are many monogenic causes, including monogenic beta-cell dysfunction, mitochondrial diabetes and severe insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes in the young is becoming more prevalent, particularly after adolescence. It's important to understand the clinical features and diagnostic tools available to classify the different forms of young adult diabetes. Classic type 1 diabetes is characterised by positive beta-cell antibodies and absence of endogenous insulin secretion. Young type 2 diabetes is accompanied by metabolic syndrome with obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Monogenic beta-cell dysfunction is characterised by non-autoimmune, C-peptide positive diabetes with a strong family history, while mitochondrial diabetes features deafness and other neurological involvement. Severe insulin resistance involves a young-onset metabolic syndrome often with a disproportionately low BMI. A suspected diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is confirmed with genetic testing, which is widely available in specialist centres across the world. Treatment of young adult diabetes is similarly diverse. Mutations in the transcription factors HNF1A and HNF4A and in the beta-cell potassium ATP channel components cause diabetes which responds to low dose and high dose sulfonylurea agents, respectively, while glucokinase mutations require no treatment. Monogenic insulin resistance and young-onset type 2 diabetes are both challenging to treat, but first line management involves insulin sensitisers and aggressive management of cardiovascular risk. Outcomes are poor in young-onset type 2 diabetes compared to both older onset type 2 and type 1 diabetes diagnosed at a similar age. The evidence base for treatments in monogenic and young-onset type 2 diabetes relies on studies of moderate quality at best and largely on extrapolation from work conducted in older type 2 diabetes subjects. Better quality, larger studies, particularly of newer agents would improve treatment prospects for young adults with diabetes.

27445006|t|Common variants of HNF1A gene are associated with diabetic retinopathy and poor glycemic control in normal-weight Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
27445006|a|AIM: This study investigated the associations between the common hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A (HNF1A) variants and the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in relation to the glycemic control and weight status. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal analysis was conducted among 354 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (mean follow-up duration: 5.8+-2.5 years). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the cumulative incidence of DR was calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model. During the observation period, the longitudinal associations of the HNF1A diplotypes with the risk of DR and the clinical parameters were also analyzed using the generalized estimating equations approach. RESULTS: The combination of risk variants, i.e., rs1169288-C, rs1183910-A and rs2464196-A, was defined as the H1 haplotype. The incidence of DR was higher in the H1/H1 diplotype cases than in the others (HR 2.75 vs. non-H1/non-H1; p=0.02). Only in normal-weight subjects, the risks of DR and poor glycemic control were higher in the H1/H1 diplotype cases than in the others [odds ratio 4.08 vs. non-H1/non-H1, p=0.02; odds ratio 3.03, p=0.01; respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the common HNF1A diplotype of three risk variants may be an independent risk factor for the development of DR resulting from poor glycemic control in normal-weight patients with T2DM. These results need to be replicated in larger and more varied study populations.

27551309|t|Several type 2 diabetes-associated variants in genes annotated to WNT signaling interact with dietary fiber in relation to incidence of type 2 diabetes.
27551309|a|BACKGROUND: TCF7L2 is a central transcription factor in the canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling pathway, and genetic variants in TCF7L2 have been found to interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes risk. Here, we investigate whether other type 2 diabetes genes could be involved in the WNT signaling pathway and whether variants in such genes might interact with dietary fiber on type 2 diabetes incidence. RESULTS: We included 26,905 individuals without diabetes from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study cohort. Diet data was collected at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire, a 7-day food record, and an interview. Altogether, 51 gene loci were analyzed for putative links to WNT signaling. Over a mean follow-up period of 14.7 years, 3132 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were recorded. Seven genes (nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) were annotated as involved in WNT signaling including TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), HHEX (rs1111875), HNF1A (rs7957197), NOTCH2 (rs10923931), TLE4 (rs13292136), ZBED3 (rs4457053), and PPARG (rs1801282 and rs13081389). SNPs in TCF7L2, NOTCH2, and ZBED3 showed significant interactions with fiber intake on type 2 diabetes incidence (P interaction = 0.034, 0.005, 0.017, and 0.002, respectively). The magnitude of the association between the TCF7L2 risk allele and incident type 2 diabetes increased from the lowest to the highest quintiles of fiber intake. Higher fiber associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk only among risk allele carriers of the NOTCH2 variant and homozygotes of the risk allele of the ZBED3 variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several type 2 diabetes susceptibility SNPs in genes involved in WNT signaling may interact with dietary fiber intake on type 2 diabetes incidence.

27551471|t|BH3-Only protein bmf is required for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in an in vivo model of HNF1alpha-MODY diabetes.
27551471|a|Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene can lead to diminished amounts of functional HNF-1alpha, resulting in the onset of a particularly severe form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We have previously shown that induction of a dominant-negative mutant of HNF-1alpha (DNHNF-1alpha) results in the activation of the bioenergetic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), preceding the onset of apoptosis and the induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain-3-only protein Bmf (Bcl-2-modifying factor) as a mediator of DNHNF-1alpha-induced apoptosis. Through the knockout of bmf in a transgenic mouse model with DNHNF-1alpha suppression of HNF-1alpha function in pancreatic beta-cells, this study aimed to examine the effect of loss-of-function of this BH3-only protein on the disease pathology and progression, and further elucidate the role of Bmf in mediating DNHNF-1alpha-induced beta-cell loss. Morphological analysis revealed an attenuation in beta-cell loss in bmf-deficient diabetic male mice and preserved insulin content. Surprisingly, bmf deficiency was found to exacerbate hyperglycemia in both diabetic male and hyperglycemic female mice, and ultimately resulted in a decreased glucose-stimulated insulin response, implicating a role for Bmf in glucose homeostasis regulation independent of an effect on beta-cell loss. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Bmf contributes to the decline in beta-cells in a mouse model of HNF1A-MODY but is also required for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in vivo.

27571483|t|The Genetic Architecture of Diabetes in Pregnancy: Implications for Clinical Practice.
27571483|a|The genetic architecture of diabetes mellitus in general and in pregnancy is complex, owing to the multiple types of diabetes that comprise both complex/polygenic forms and monogenic (largely caused by a mutation in a single gene) forms such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have complex genetic etiologies, with over 40 and 90 genes/loci, respectively, implicated that interact with environmental/lifestyle factors. The genetic etiology of gestational diabetes mellitus has largely been found to overlap that of T2D. Genetic testing for complex forms of diabetes is not currently useful clinically, but genetic testing for monogenic forms, particularly MODY, has important utility for determining treatment, managing risk in family members, and pregnancy management. In particular, diagnosing MODY2, caused by GCK mutations, indicates that insulin should not be used, including during pregnancy, with the possible exception of an unaffected pregnancy during the third trimester to prevent macrosomia. A relatively simple method for identifying women with MODY2 has been piloted. MODY1, caused by HNF4A mutations, can paradoxically cause neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and macrosomia, indicating that detecting these cases is also clinically important. Diagnosing all MODY types provides opportunities for diagnosing other family members.

27634015|t|Genetic Confirmation Rate in Clinically Suspected Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young.
27634015|a|OBJECTIVES: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes, reportedly accounting for 2% to 5% of all cases of diabetes. In samples from Canadian patients referred for molecular genetic confirmation of a clinically suspected MODY, we determined the prevalence of likely disease-causing DNA variants in known MODY genes. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2015, our centre received requests from colleagues for DNA sequencing of 96 samples from unrelated Canadian patients with clinically suspected MODY. Prior to 2012, we used Sanger sequencing, and since 2012 we have used targeted next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Of 96 samples received, 39 (40.6%) had a likely rare causal variant in 1 of 8 known MODY genes. Of these, 20 (51.3%) and 19 (48.7%) were diagnosed by Sanger and targeted next-generation sequencing, respectively. The 39 mutation-positive samples had 1 of 39 rare variants, of which the majority were in genes encoding either glucokinase (GCK, or MODY2) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A, or MODY3). Furthermore, 12 (30.8%) of the detected rare variants had been unreported previously but were likely to have been clinically significant according to standard bioinformatic methods. An additional 6 samples had rare variants in MODY genes that were of uncertain clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that clinical suspicion for MODY has a diagnostic yield of ~40% at the molecular level. Confirmatory genetic testing in patients suspected to have MODY allows for definitive diagnoses which, in turn, may guide management and provide rationales for screening other family members presymptomatically.

27667715|t|A suppressor locus for MODY3-diabetes.
27667715|a|Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3), linked to mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A, is the most prevalent form of monogenic diabetes mellitus. HNF1alpha-deficiency leads to defective insulin secretion via a molecular mechanism that is still not completely understood. Moreover, in MODY3 patients the severity of insulin secretion can be extremely variable even in the same kindred, indicating that modifier genes may control the onset of the disease. With the use of a mouse model for HNF1alpha-deficiency, we show here that specific genetic backgrounds (C3H and CBA) carry a powerful genetic suppressor of diabetes. A genome scan analysis led to the identification of a major suppressor locus on chromosome 3 (Moda1). Moda1 locus contains 11 genes with non-synonymous SNPs that significantly interacts with other loci on chromosomes 4, 11 and 18. Mechanistically, the absence of HNF1alpha in diabetic-prone (sensitive) strains leads to postnatal defective islets growth that is remarkably restored in resistant strains. Our findings are relevant to human genetics since Moda1 is syntenic with a human locus identified by genome wide association studies of fasting glycemia in patients. Most importantly, our results show that a single genetic locus can completely suppress diabetes in Hnf1a-deficiency.

27807544|t|Qualitative Parameters of the Colonic Flora in Patients with HNF1A-MODY Are Different from Those Observed in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
27807544|a|Background. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is determined by genetic and environmental factors. There have been many studies on the relationship between the composition of the gastrointestinal bacterial flora, T2DM, and obesity. There are no data, however, on the gut microbiome structure in monogenic forms of the disease including Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). Methods. The aim of the investigation was to compare the qualitative parameters of the colonic flora in patients with HNF1A-MODY and T2DM and healthy individuals. 16S sequencing of bacterial DNA isolated from the collected fecal samples using the MiSeq platform was performed. Results. There were significant between-group differences in the bacterial profile. At the phylum level, the amount of Proteobacteria was higher (p = 0.0006) and the amount of Bacteroidetes was lower (p = 0.0005) in T2DM group in comparison to the control group. In HNF1A-MODY group, the frequency of Bacteroidetes was lower than in the control group (p = 0.0143). At the order level, Turicibacterales was more abundant in HNF1A-MODY group than in T2DM group. Conclusions. It appears that there are differences in the gut microbiome composition between patients with HNF1A-MODY and type 2 diabetes. Further investigation on this matter should be conducted.

27810688|t|Clinical whole exome sequencing in early onset diabetes patients.
27810688|a|AIMS: There could be an overlap of monogenic diabetes and early onset type 2 diabetes in those who are diagnosed before age of 30years. Genetic diagnosis in these patients might improve the quality of care. A limited number of studies have used whole exome sequencing (WES) in Asian patients with early onset diabetes, and the clinical utility of WES is largely unknown. METHODS: We performed whole exome capture and massive parallel sequencing in 28 patients with early onset diabetes. Those who had a strong family history of diabetes were preferentially enrolled. Rare and non-silent variants in 29 genes known to cause monogenic diabetes, including 12 maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes, were investigated for pathogenicity. RESULTS: The average depth of on-target WES reads was 97 X. A total of four pathogenic or likely pathogenic rare missense variants (p.Leu319Pro in HNF4A, p.His103Tyr and p.Arg74Gln in ABCC8, and p.Leu139Val in HNF1A) in MODY genes were identified in three patients. Although four rare non-silent variants in MODY genes (p.Arg183Cys in PAX4, p.Val139Ile and p.Pro740fs in CEL, and p.Val147Ile in HNF4A) and two rare non-silent variants in monogenic diabetes genes (p.Glu169Lys in WFS1, and p.Pro407Gln in GATA4) were identified, their pathogenicity was uncertain or likely benign. CONCLUSIONS: WES could be an initial option for genetic testing in patients with early onset diabetes. However, sufficient and universal coverage of genes of interest is required. In addition, it could be difficult to interpret variant pathogenicity, and these cases might require further validation.

27899486|t|Functional Investigations of HNF1A Identify Rare Variants as Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes in the General Population.
27899486|a|Variants in HNF1A encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1A) are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young form 3 (MODY 3) and type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether functional classification of HNF1A rare coding variants can inform models of diabetes risk prediction in the general population by analyzing the effect of 27 HNF1A variants identified in well-phenotyped populations (n = 4,115). Bioinformatics tools classified 11 variants as likely pathogenic and showed no association with diabetes risk (combined minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.22%; odds ratio [OR] 2.02; 95% CI 0.73-5.60; P = 0.18). However, a different set of 11 variants that reduced HNF-1A transcriptional activity to &lt;60% of normal (wild-type) activity was strongly associated with diabetes in the general population (combined MAF 0.22%; OR 5.04; 95% CI 1.99-12.80; P = 0.0007). Our functional investigations indicate that 0.44% of the population carry HNF1A variants that result in a substantially increased risk for developing diabetes. These results suggest that functional characterization of variants within MODY genes may overcome the limitations of bioinformatics tools for the purposes of presymptomatic diabetes risk prediction in the general population.

27913849|t|Targeted next-generation sequencing reveals MODY in up to 6.5% of antibody-negative diabetes cases listed in the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry.
27913849|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: MODY can be wrongly diagnosed as type 1 diabetes in children. We aimed to find the prevalence of MODY in a nationwide population-based registry of childhood diabetes. METHODS: Using next-generation sequencing, we screened the HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, GCK and INS genes in all 469 children (12.1%) negative for both GAD and IA-2 autoantibodies and 469 antibody-positive matched controls selected from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry (3882 children). Variants were classified using clinical diagnostic criteria for pathogenicity ranging from class 1 (neutral) to class 5 (pathogenic). RESULTS: We identified 58 rare exonic and splice variants in cases and controls. Among antibody-negative patients, 6.5% had genetic variants of classes 3-5 (vs 2.4% in controls; p = 0.002). For the stricter classification (classes 4 and 5), the corresponding number was 4.1% (vs 0.2% in controls; p = 1.6 x 10-5). HNF1A showed the strongest enrichment of class 3-5 variants, with 3.9% among antibody-negative patients (vs 0.4% in controls; p = 0.0002). Antibody-negative carriers of variants in class 3 had a similar phenotype to those carrying variants in classes 4 and 5. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This is the first study screening for MODY in all antibody-negative children in a nationwide population-based registry. Our results suggest that the prevalence of MODY in antibody-negative childhood diabetes may reach 6.5%. One-third of these MODY cases had not been recognised by clinicians. Since a precise diagnosis is important for treatment and genetic counselling, molecular screening of all antibody-negative children should be considered in routine diagnostics.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is caused by genetic defects of regulation of insulin secretion that induce insulin oversecretion in intrauterine life and postnatally. The clinical consequence is fetal macrosomia and subsequently neonatal and infantile hypoglycaemia. The most severe form is caused by biallelic mutations of KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes that encode both potassium channel subunits, whereas their heterozygous mutations as well as enzymatic defects (GLUD1, HADH, GCK) lead to milder presentation. HNF4A or HNF1A transcriptional factor defects lead to transient hyperinsulinism but to MODY diabetes later in life, due to biphasic beta-cell dysfunction starting as hyperfunction and developing via normal function to hypofunction. An early aetiological diagnosis and effective treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism substantially improves the outcome regarding not only survival but also neurocognitive functions.Key words: B-cell - congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) - hypoglycaemia - insulin.

28012402|t|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in Brazil: Establishment of a national registry and appraisal of available genetic and clinical data.
28012402|a|AIMS: Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic forms of diabetes caused by mutations in at least 14 genes, but mostly by mutations in Glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 homeobox A (HNF1A). This study aims to establish a national registry of MODY cases in Brazilian patients, assessing published and unpublished data. METHODS: 311 patients with clinical characteristics of MODY were analyzed, with unpublished data on 298 individuals described in 12 previous publications and 13 newly described cases in this report. RESULTS: 72 individuals had GCK mutations, 9 described in Brazilian individuals for the first time. One previously unpublished novel GCK mutation, Gly178Ala, was found in one family. 31 individuals had HNF1A mutations, 2 described for the first time in Brazilian individuals. Comparisons of GCK probands vs HNF1A: age 16+-11 vs 35+-20years; age at diagnosis 11+-8 vs 21+-7years; BMI 19+-6 vs 25+-6kg/m2; sulfonylurea users 5 vs 83%; insulin users 5 vs 17%; presence of arterial hypertension 0 vs. 33%, all p&lt;0.05. No differences were observed in lipids and C-peptide. CONCLUSIONS: Most MODY cases in Brazil are due to GCK mutations. In agreement with other studied populations, novel mutations are common. Only 14% of patients with familial diabetes carry a HNF1A mutation. Diagnosis of other rare forms of MODY is still a challenge in Brazilian population, as well as adequate strategies to screen individuals for molecular diagnosis.

28052112|t|Lower Frequency of HLA-DRB1 Type 1 Diabetes Risk Alleles in Pediatric Patients with MODY.
28052112|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of susceptible HLA-DRB1 alleles for type 1 diabetes in a cohort of pediatric patients with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of MODY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 160 families with a proband diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and 74 families with a molecular diagnosis of MODY (61 GCK-MODY and 13 HNF1A-MODY) were categorized at high definition for HLA-DRB1 locus. According to the presence or absence of the susceptible HLA-DRB1 alleles for type 1 diabetes, we considered three different HLA-DRB1 genotypes: 0 risk alleles (no DR3 no DR4); 1 risk allele (DR3 or DR4); 2 risk alleles (DR3 and/or DR4). RESULTS: Compared with type 1 diabetes, patients with MODY carried higher frequency of 0 risk alleles, OR 22.7 (95% CI: 10.7-48.6) and lower frequency of 1 or 2 risk alleles, OR 0.53 (95% CI: 0.29-0.96) and OR 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HLA-DRB1 risk alleles for type 1 diabetes is significantly lower in patients with MODY. In children and adolescents with diabetes, the presence of 2 risk alleles (DR3 and/or DR4) reduces the probability of MODY diagnosis, whereas the lack of risk alleles increases it. Therefore, we might consider that HLA-DRB1 provides additional information for the selection of patients with high probability of monogenic diabetes.

28095440|t|Comprehensive Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) Gene Screening in Pregnant Women with Diabetes in India.
28095440|a|Pregnant women with diabetes may have underlying beta cell dysfunction due to mutations/rare variants in genes associated with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). MODY gene screening would reveal those women genetically predisposed and previously unrecognized with a monogenic form of diabetes for further clinical management, family screening and genetic counselling. However, there are minimal data available on MODY gene variants in pregnant women with diabetes from India. In this study, utilizing the Next generation sequencing (NGS) based protocol fifty subjects were screened for variants in a panel of thirteen MODY genes. Of these subjects 18% (9/50) were positive for definite or likely pathogenic or uncertain MODY variants. The majority of these variants was identified in subjects with autosomal dominant family history, of whom five were in women with pre-GDM and four with overt-GDM. The identified variants included one patient with HNF1A Ser3Cys, two PDX1 Glu224Lys, His94Gln, two NEUROD1 Glu59Gln, Phe318Ser, one INS Gly44Arg, one GCK, one ABCC8 Arg620Cys and one BLK Val418Met variants. In addition, three of the seven offspring screened were positive for the identified variant. These identified variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, these findings in pregnant women with diabetes, imply that a proportion of GDM patients with autosomal dominant family history may have MODY. Further NGS based comprehensive studies with larger samples are required to confirm these finding.

28105082|t|Genetic diagnosis and treatment of a Chinese ketosis-prone MODY 3 family with depression.
28105082|a|BACKGROUND: To analyze the gene mutation and mental disorder of a Chinese ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) family, and to make a precise diagnosis and give a treatment for them. METHODS: We studied a Chinese family with a clinical diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The clinical data and the blood samples were collected. The promotor and coding regions inclusive intron exon boundaries of the HNF1A, HNF4A were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The missense mutation was also analyzed by bioinformatics. Genetic counseling was performed twice a month to relieve the mental disorder of the persons. RESULTS: The missense mutation c.779 C&gt;T (p.T260M) in exon4 of HNF1A gene was detected, and the symptom heterogenicity among persons in this family were found. All the members were retreated with Gliclazide and stopped to use other medicine, the blood glucose of them were well controlled. We also performed an active genetic counseling to them and the mental disorder of the proband's sister was relieved. CONCLUSIONS: A missense mutation of HNF1A gene was first found in Chinese ketosis-prone MODY family with manifestations heterogenicity among the persons. Sulphonylureas medicine and genetic counseling are efficiency ways to treat MODY 3 and its' mental disorder respectively.

28116330|t|Identification and functional analysis of c.422_423InsT, a novel mutation of the HNF1A gene in a patient with diabetes.
28116330|a|BACKGROUND: HNF1A gene regulates liver-specific genes, and genes that have a role in glucose metabolism, transport, and secretion of insulin. HNF1A gene mutations are frequently associated with type 2 diabetes. HNF1A protein has three domains: the dimerization domain, the DNA-binding domain, and the trans-activation domain. Some mutations in the dimerization or DNA-binding domains have no influence on the normal allele, while others have dominant negative effects. The I27L, A98V, and S487N polymorphisms are common variants of the HNF1A gene; they have been found in T2D and non-diabetic subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched for mutations in the first three exons of the HNF1A gen in an Amerindian population of 71 diabetic patients. DNA sequencing revealed the previously reported I27L polymorphism (c.79A&gt;C) in 53% of diabetic patients and in 67% of the control group. Thus, the I27L/L27L polymorphism might be a marker of Amerindians. In addition, we found the c.422_423InsT mutation in the HNF1A gene of one patient, which had not been previously reported. This mutation resulted in a frame shift of the open reading frame and a new translation stop in codon 187, leading to a truncated polypeptide of 186 amino acids (Q141Hfs*47). This novel mutation affects the DNA-binding capacity of the mutant HNF1A protein by EMSA; its intracellular localization by fluorescence and confocal microscopy, and a dominant-negative effect affecting the DNA-binding capacity of the normal HNF1A by EMSA. We also studied the homology modeling structure to understand the effect of this mutation on its DNA-binding capacity and its dominant negative effect. CONCLUSION: The HNF1A Q141Hfs*47 mutant polypeptide has no DNA-binding capacity and exerts a dominant negative effect on the HNF1A protein. Therefore, it might produce severe phenotypic effects on the expression levels of a set of beta-cell genes. Consequently, its screening should be included in the genetic analysis of diabetic patients after more functional studies are performed.

28170077|t|Clinical application of ACMG-AMP guidelines in HNF1A and GCK variants in a cohort of MODY families.
28170077|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of monogenic diabetes with autosomal dominant inheritance. GCK -MODY and HNF1A -MODY are the prevalent subtypes. Currently, there is growing concern regarding the correct interpretation of molecular genetic findings. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) updated guidelines to interpret and classify molecular variants. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MODY ( GCK / HNF1A ) in a large cohort of Brazilian families, to report variants related to phenotype, and to classify them according to ACMG guidelines. One hundred and nine probands were investigated, 45% with clinical suspicion of GCK -MODY and 55% with suspicion of HNF1A -MODY. Twenty-five different variants were identified in GCK gene (30 probands-61% of positivity), and 7 variants in HNF1A (10 probands-17% of positivity). Fourteen of them were novel (12- GCK /2- HNF1A ). ACMG guidelines were able to classify a large portion of variants as pathogenic (36%- GCK /86%- HNF1A ) and likely pathogenic (44%- GCK /14%- HNF1A ), with 16% (5/32) as uncertain significance. This allows us to determine the pathogenicity classification more efficiently, and also reinforces the suspected associations with the phenotype among novel variants.

28254450|t|Diabetic phenotype of transgenic pigs introduced by dominant-negative mutant hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha.
28254450|a|AIM: The present study aimed to identify the characteristics of genetically modified pigs carrying a mutant human gene as a research model for diabetes and its complications. METHODS: We developed a transgenic cloned pig (founder, male) carrying a mutant gene, i.e., human HNF-1alpha (P291fsinsC), which is responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3. Transgenic progeny obtained via the artificial insemination of wild type (WT) sows with the cryopreserved sperm derived from the founder pig was pathologically examined. RESULTS: The transgenic progeny maintained a high blood glucose level (&gt;200mg/dL). Additionally, the oral glucose tolerance test results showed that the recovery of blood glucose levels in the transgenic progeny was significantly delayed compared with that in the WT semi-siblings. Hypoplasia of the islets of Langerhans was confirmed by the histopathological image of the pancreas, based on the hyperglycemia noted in the progeny being ascribed to decreased insulin secretion. Retinal hemorrhage and cotton-wool spots, i.e., findings consistent with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, were detected, and these progressed over time. The histopathological image of the renal glomeruli showed a nodular lesion that is characteristic of diabetic nephropathy in humans. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that the genetically modified pig that we developed is a promising model for research on diabetes and its complications.

28323911|t|Monogenic Diabetes Accounts for 6.3% of Cases Referred to 15 Italian Pediatric Diabetes Centers During 2007 to 2012.
28323911|a|Context: An etiologic diagnosis of diabetes can affect the therapeutic strategy and prognosis of chronic complications. Objective: The aim of the present study was to establish the relative percentage of different diabetes subtypes in patients attending Italian pediatric diabetes centers and the influence of an etiologic diagnosis on therapy. Design, Setting, and Patients: This was a retrospective study. The clinical records of 3781 consecutive patients (age, 0 to 18 years) referred to 15 pediatric diabetes clinics with a diagnosis of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012 were examined. The clinical characteristics of the patients at their first referral to the centers, type 1 diabetes-related autoantibodies, molecular genetics records, and C-peptide measurements, if requested for the etiologic diagnosis, were acquired. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was to assess the percentage of each diabetes subtype in our sample. Results: Type 1 diabetes represented the main cause (92.4%) of diabetes in this group of patients, followed by monogenic diabetes, which accounted for 6.3% of cases [maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), 5.5%; neonatal diabetes mellitus, 0.6%, genetic syndromes, 0.2%]. A genetic diagnosis prompted the transfer from insulin to sulphonylureas in 12 patients bearing mutations in the HNF1A or KCNJ11 genes. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 1% of the patients. Conclusions: Monogenic diabetes is highly prevalent in patients referred to Italian pediatric diabetes centers. A genetic diagnosis guided the therapeutic decisions, allowed the formulation of a prognosis regarding chronic diabetic complications for a relevant number of patients (i.e.,GCK/MODY), and helped to provide genetic counseling.

28324025|t|Clinical and Genetic Features of Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Renal Glycosuria.
28324025|a|Context: A sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which increases urinary glucose excretion, was reported to decrease blood glucose levels and deaths among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established cardiovascular disease. SLC5A2 and HNF1A mutations are associated with renal glycosuria, but their contributions to renal glycosuria in patients with T2DM are not well understood. Objective: To assess the clinical features of patients with T2DM and renal glycosuria and those with T2DM and low urinary glucose excretion (LUGE) and identify variants in the exons of SLC5A2 and HNF1A in patients with renal glycosuria and T2DM. Design: A total of 2044 Chinese patients with T2DM, including 64 patients with renal glycosuria and 58 patients with LUGE, were tested for their plasma and urine glucose concentrations after fasting. SLC5A2 and HNF1A exons were sequenced. Results: Compared with patients with LUGE, those with renal glycosuria were younger (P = 0.008), had lower body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.002) and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values (P &lt; 0.0001), and were less likely to have hypertension (P = 0.006). HOMA-IR and BMI were negatively associated with renal glycosuria after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and insulin therapy. One novel mutation (V359G) of SLC5A2 in 32 patients with renal glycosuria and one known mutation (R131W) of HNF1A in 28 nonobese patients with renal glycosuria were identified. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there are subtypes of T2DM characterized by different urinary glucose excretion and cardiovascular risk factors. SLC5A2 and HNF1A mutations partially explain renal glycosuria in patients with T2DM.

28395978|t|The spectrum of HNF1A gene mutations in patients with MODY 3 phenotype and identification of three novel germline mutations in Turkish Population.
28395978|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early age of onset, and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Heterozygous mutations in several genes may cause MODY. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the molecular spectrum of HNF1A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a) mutations, in the individuals referred to a reference center for molecular genetic analysis. Mutations screening was performed in a group of 136 unrelated patients (average age 17.22 years) selected by clinical characterization of MODY. Mutation screening involved direct sequencing of the HNF1A gene. RESULTS: Among 136 individuals analyzed, 10 were carrying heterozygous HNF1A mutations, 3 of them being novel. Clinical features, such as age of diabetes at diagnosis or severity of hyperglycemia, were not related to the mutation type or location. No clear phenotype - genotype correlations were identified. CONCLUSIONS: As a conclusion MODY resulted from HNF1A mutations shows heterogeneity at both phenotypic and molecular levels in Turkish population.

28410371|t|Determining the role of missense mutations in the POU domain of HNF1A that reduce the DNA-binding affinity: A computational approach.
28410371|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a non-ketotic form of diabetes associated with poor insulin secretion. Over the past years, several studies have reported the association of missense mutations in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha (HNF1A) with MODY3. Missense mutations in the POU homeodomain (POUH) of HNF1A hinder binding to the DNA, thereby leading to a dysfunctional protein. Missense mutations of the HNF1A were retrieved from public databases and subjected to a three-step computational mutational analysis to identify the underlying mechanism. First, the pathogenicity and stability of the mutations were analyzed to determine whether they alter protein structure and function. Second, the sequence conservation and DNA-binding sites of the mutant positions were assessed; as HNF1A protein is a transcription factor. Finally, the biochemical properties of the biological system were validated using molecular dynamic simulations in Gromacs 4.6.3 package. Two arginine residues (131 and 203) in the HNF1A protein are highly conserved residues and contribute to the function of the protein. Furthermore, the R131W, R131Q, and R203C mutations were predicted to be highly deleterious by in silico tools and showed lower binding affinity with DNA when compared to the native protein using the molecular docking analysis. Triplicate runs of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (50ns) revealed smaller changes in patterns of deviation, fluctuation, and compactness, in complexes containing the R131Q and R131W mutations, compared to complexes containing the R203C mutant complex. We observed reduction in the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, compactness, and electrostatic potential, as well as the loss of salt bridges, in the R203C mutant complex. Substitution of arginine with cysteine at position 203 decreases the affinity of the protein for DNA, thereby destabilizing the protein. Based on our current findings, the MD approach is an important tool for elucidating the impact and affinity of mutations in DNA-protein interactions and understanding their function.

28438156|t|Relative contribution of type 1 and type 2 diabetes loci to the genetic etiology of adult-onset, non-insulin-requiring autoimmune diabetes.
28438156|a|BACKGROUND: In adulthood, autoimmune diabetes can present as non-insulin-requiring diabetes, termed as 'latent autoimmune diabetes in adults' (LADA). In this study, we investigated established type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic loci in a large cohort of LADA cases to assess where LADA is situated relative to these two well-characterized, classic forms of diabetes. METHODS: We tested the association of T1D and T2D GWAS-implicated loci in 978 LADA cases and 1057 non-diabetic controls of European ancestry using a linear mixed model. We then compared the associations of T1D and T2D loci between LADA and T1D and T2D cases, respectively. We quantified the difference in genetic risk between each given disease at each locus, and also calculated genetic risk scores to quantify how genetic liability to T1D and T2D distinguished LADA cases from controls. RESULTS: Overall, our results showed that LADA is genetically more similar to T1D, with the exception of an association at the T2D HNF1A locus. Several T1D loci were associated with LADA, including the major histocompatibility complex region, as well as at PTPN22, SH2B3, and INS. Contrary to previous studies, the key T2D risk allele at TCF7L2 (rs7903146-T) had a significantly lower frequency in LADA cases, suggesting that this locus does not play a role in LADA etiology. When constrained on antibody status, the similarity between LADA and T1D became more apparent; however, the HNF1A and TCF7L2 observations persisted. CONCLUSION: LADA is genetically closer to T1D than T2D, although the genetic load of T1D risk alleles is less than childhood-onset T1D, particularly at the major histocompatibility complex region, potentially accounting for the later disease onset. Our results show that the genetic spectrum of T1D extends into adult-onset diabetes, where it can clinically masquerade as T2D. Furthermore, T2D genetic risk plays a small role in LADA, with a degree of evidence for the HNF1A locus, highlighting the potential for genetic risk scores to contribute towards defining diabetes subtypes.

28453780|t|Variation in Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young Genes Influence Response to Interventions for Diabetes Prevention.
28453780|a|Context: Variation in genes that cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has been associated with diabetes incidence and glycemic traits. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether genetic variation in MODY genes leads to differential responses to insulin-sensitizing interventions. Design and Setting: This was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), involving 27 US academic institutions. We genotyped 22 missense and 221 common variants in the MODY-causing genes in the participants in the DPP. Participants and Interventions: The study included 2806 genotyped DPP participants randomized to receive intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 935), metformin (n = 927), or placebo (n = 944). Main Outcome Measures: Association of MODY genetic variants with diabetes incidence at a median of 3 years and measures of 1-year beta-cell function, insulinogenic index, and oral disposition index. Analyses were stratified by treatment group for significant single-nucleotide polymorphism x treatment interaction (Pint &lt; 0.05). Sequence kernel association tests examined the association between an aggregate of rare missense variants and insulinogenic traits. Results: After 1 year, the minor allele of rs3212185 (HNF4A) was associated with improved beta-cell function in the metformin and lifestyle groups but not the placebo group; the minor allele of rs6719578 (NEUROD1) was associated with an increase in insulin secretion in the metformin group but not in the placebo and lifestyle groups. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that genetic variation among MODY genes may influence response to insulin-sensitizing interventions.

28490609|t|A Genome-Wide Association Study of IVGTT-Based Measures of First-Phase Insulin Secretion Refines the Underlying Physiology of Type 2 Diabetes Variants.
28490609|a|Understanding the physiological mechanisms by which common variants predispose to type 2 diabetes requires large studies with detailed measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity. Here we performed the largest genome-wide association study of first-phase insulin secretion, as measured by intravenous glucose tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes from 10 studies. We aimed to refine the mechanisms of 178 known associations between common variants and glycemic traits and identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of first-phase insulin secretion at P &lt; 0.05 and provided new evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion, intrinsic to the islet cells, is a key mechanism underlying the associations at the HNF1A, IGF2BP2, KCNQ1, HNF1B, VPS13C/C2CD4A, FAF1, PTPRD, AP3S2, KCNK16, MAEA, LPP, WFS1, and TMPRSS6 loci. The fasting glucose-raising allele near PDX1, a known key insulin transcription factor, was strongly associated with lower first-phase insulin secretion but has no evidence for an effect on type 2 diabetes risk. The diabetes risk allele at TCF7L2 was associated with a stronger effect on peak insulin response than on C-peptide-based insulin secretion rate, suggesting a possible additional role in hepatic insulin clearance or insulin processing. In summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which common genetic variation influences type 2 diabetes risk and glycemic traits.

28556992|t|Management of sulfonylurea-treated monogenic diabetes in pregnancy: implications of placental glibenclamide transfer.
28556992|a|The optimum treatment for HNF1A/HNF4A maturity-onset diabetes of the young and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP ) channel neonatal diabetes, outside pregnancy, is sulfonylureas, but there is little evidence regarding the most appropriate treatment during pregnancy. Glibenclamide has been widely used in the treatment of gestational diabetes, but recent data have established that glibenclamide crosses the placenta and increases risk of macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycaemia. This raises questions about its use in pregnancy. We review the available evidence and make recommendations for the management of monogenic diabetes in pregnancy. Due to the risk of stimulating increased insulin secretion in utero, we recommend that in women with HNF1A/ HNF4A maturity-onset diabetes of the young, those with good glycaemic control who are on a sulfonylurea per conception either transfer to insulin before conception (at the risk of a short-term deterioration of glycaemic control) or continue with sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) treatment in the first trimester and transfer to insulin in the second trimester. Early delivery is needed if the fetus inherits an HNF4A mutation from either parent because increased insulin secretion results in ~800-g weight gain in utero, and prolonged severe neonatal hypoglycaemia can occur post-delivery. If the fetus inherits a KATP neonatal diabetes mutation from their mother they have greatly reduced insulin secretion in utero that reduces fetal growth by ~900 g. Treating the mother with glibenclamide in the third trimester treats the affected fetus in utero, normalising fetal growth, but is not desirable, especially in the high doses used in this condition, if the fetus is unaffected. Prospective studies of pregnancy in monogenic diabetes are needed.

28593615|t|A single dose of dapagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, induces higher glycosuria in GCK- and HNF1A-MODY than in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
28593615|a|AIMS: SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of oral hypoglycemic agents used in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Their effectiveness in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is unknown. We aimed to assess the response to a single dose of 10 mg dapagliflozin in patients with Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha (HNF1A)-MODY, Glucokinase (GCK)-MODY, and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We examined 14 HNF1A-MODY, 19 GCK-MODY, and 12 type 2 diabetes patients. All studied individuals received a single morning dose of 10 mg of dapagliflozin added to their current therapy of diabetes. To assess the response to dapagliflozin we analyzed change in urinary glucose to creatinine ratio and serum 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) level. RESULTS: There were only four patients with positive urine glucose before dapagliflozin administration (one with HNF1A-MODY, two with GCK-MODY, and one with T2DM), whereas after SGLT-2 inhibitor use, glycosuria occurred in all studied participants. Considerable changes in mean glucose to creatinine ratio after dapagliflozin administration were observed in all three groups (20.51 +- 12.08, 23.19 +- 8.10, and 9.84 +- 6.68 mmol/mmol for HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, and T2DM, respectively, p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). Post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences in mean glucose to creatinine ratio change between type 2 diabetes and each monogenic diabetes in response to dapagliflozin (p = 0.02, p = 0.003 for HNF1-A and GCK MODY, respectively), but not between the two MODY forms (p = 0.7231). Significant change in serum 1,5-AG was noticed only in T2DM and it was -6.57 +- 7.34 mg/ml (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of dapagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, induces higher glycosuria in GCK- and HNF1A-MODY than in T2DM. Whether flozins are a valid therapeutic option in these forms of MODY requires long-term clinical studies.

28597946|t|Comprehensive screening for monogenic diabetes in 89 Japanese children with insulin-requiring antibody-negative type 1 diabetes.
28597946|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in causative genes for neonatal diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young have been identified in multiple patients with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes (T1D). OBJECTIVES: We aimed to clarify the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of monogenic abnormalities among 89 children with autoantibody-negative insulin-requiring T1D. METHODS: Mutations in 30 genes were screened using next-generation sequencing, and copy-number alterations of 4 major causative genes were examined using multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification. We compared the clinical characteristics between mutation carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: We identified 11 probable pathogenic substitutions (6 in INS , 2 in HNF1A , 2 in HNF4A , and 1 in HNF1B ) in 11 cases, but no copy-number abnormalities. Only 2 mutation carriers had affected parents. De novo occurrence was confirmed for 3 mutations. The non-carrier group, but not the carrier group, was enriched with susceptible HLA alleles. Mutation carriers exhibited comparable phenotypes to those of non-carriers, except for a relatively normal body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant genetic overlap between autoantibody-negative T1D and monogenic diabetes. Mutations in INS and HNF genes, but not those in GCK and other monogenic diabetes genes, likely play critical roles in children with insulin-requiring T1D. This study also suggests the relatively high de novo rates of INS and HNF mutations, and the etiological link between autoimmune abnormalities and T1D in the non-carrier group. Carriers of monogenic mutations show non-specific phenotypes among all T1D cases, although they are more likely to have a normal BMI at diagnosis than non-carriers.

28635922|t|[Molecular genetics of maturity-onset diabetes of the young].
28635922|a|To verify the type of diabetes mellitus (DM) remains an extremely important problem in endocrinology, as along with types 1 and 2 DM there are rarer hereditary types of DM, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The latter is a genetic type of DM, which is characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance. Eleven types of MODY (MODY 1 to MODY13) are identified; each is associated with mutations in the certain gene: HNF4A, GCK, HNF1A, PDX1, HNF1B, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, KCNJ11 and ABCC8. A molecular genetic testing for suspected MODY is conducted to verify the diagnosis and to define a subtype of MODY, patient management tactics, to predict the outcome of the disease and its complications in relation to the found subtype of MODY. It is also important to seek mutation causing MODY in terms of the early detection of MODY in the first-degree relatives of a proband, appropriate therapy of the disease, and prevention of its complications.

28712822|t|Association study of HNF1A polymorphisms with metabolic syndrome in the Moroccan population.
28712822|a|AIMS: Variants in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) gene are associated with Metabolic Syndromeand its components independently. In this study, we aimed to assess the statistical association of the rs1169288, rs2464196 and rs735396 variants and haplotypes of HNF1A gene with metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in a Moroccan population sample. METHODS: Three variants in the HNF1A gene were genotyped, rs1169288 A&gt;C, rs2464196 G&gt;A and rs735396 T&gt;C in cases and controls from Moroccan population using KASPar  technology (KBioscience, UK). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were assessed. MS was defined according to the international Diabetes Federation (IDF). The effects of HNF1A polymorphisms and constructed haplotypes on MS were estimated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The HNF1A gene, rs1169288 and rs2464196 variants conferred an increased risk to MS (OR=2.08, 95%CI=1.38-3.14, P=0.0005 and OR=1.52, 95%IC=1.05-2.20, P=0.03, respectively) when adjusted for BMI, sex and age. We found that the C allele of the variant rs735396 was associated with an increased triglycerides level (p-value=0.04434) among patients and high weist circumference (P=0.02005) and total cholesterol (P=0.03227) amount among controls. The haplotype AAT (OR=5.656, P&lt;0.00001) was the most significantly associated with susceptibility to metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that SNPs rs1169288 and rs2464196 of HNF1A gene were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in a Morrocan population. Furthermore, the CAC, AAC, AAT and AGT haplotypes of these SNPs and rs735396 were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome.

28766492|t|MODY3, renal cysts, and Dandy-Walker variants with a microdeletion spanning the HNF1A gene.
28766492|a|Heterozygous hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha gene (&lt;italic&gt;HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt;) mutations are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), but they rarely involve extrahepatic manifestations. Renal cysts and diabetes syndrome can be caused by &lt;italic&gt;HNF1B&lt;/italic&gt; mutations. No association between MODY3 and Dandy-Walker variants (DWV) has been reported. &lt;italic&gt;HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt; mutations might be responsible for renal malformations. In a Japanese girl with glycosuria, developmental delay, mental retardation, renal cysts, and DWV, the &lt;italic&gt;HNF1B&lt;/italic&gt; gene had no mutations. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified a de-novo interstitial 12q24.22-q24.31 deletion of 5.6 Mb encompassing the &lt;italic&gt;HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt; gene, which is compatible with a diagnosis of MODY3. The variety of phenotypes suggests a novel microdeletion syndrome spanning the &lt;italic&gt;HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt; gene. Because &lt;italic&gt;HNF1B&lt;/italic&gt; functions as an &lt;italic&gt;HNF1A/HNF1B&lt;/italic&gt; heterodimer, haploinsufficient &lt;italic&gt;HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt; interacts with a certain &lt;italic&gt;HNF1B&lt;/italic&gt; haplotype. The resulting truncated heterodimer might engender renal cysts. More patients with well-defined deletion within 12q.24.31 must be evaluated to produce a detailed genotype-phenotype correlation and to elucidate this emerging microdeletion syndrome. : .

28862987|t|MODY in Ukraine: genes, clinical phenotypes and treatment.
28862987|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has not been previously studied in Ukraine. We investigated the genetic etiology in a selected cohort of patients with diabetes diagnosed before 18 years of age, and in their family members. METHODS: Genetic testing of the most prevalent MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B and INS) was undertaken for 36 families (39 affected individuals) by Sanger or targeted next generation sequencing. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis of MODY was made in 15/39 affected individuals from 12/36 families (33%). HNF1A and HNF4A MODY were the most common subtypes, accounting for 9/15 of MODY cases. Eight patients with HNF1A or HNF4A MODY and inadequate glycemic control were successfully transferred to sulfonylureas. Median HbA1c decreased from 67 mmol/mol (range 58-69) to 47 mmol/mol (range 43-50) (8.3% [7.5-8.5] to 6.4% [6.1-6.7]) 3 months after transfer (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing identified pathogenic HNF1A and HNF4A variants as the most common cause of MODY in Ukraine. Transfer to sulfonylureas substantially improved the glycemic control of these patients.

28934671|t|The HNF1A mutant Ala180Val: Clinical challenges in determining causality of a rare HNF1A variant in familial diabetes.
28934671|a|AIMS: Heterozygous mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A (HNF1A) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). Our aim was to compare two families with suspected dominantly inherited diabetes and a new HNF1A variant of unknown clinical significance. METHODS: The HNF1A gene was sequenced in two independently recruited families from the Norwegian MODY Registry. Both familes were phenotyped clinically and biochemically. Microsatellite markers around and within the HNF1A locus were used for haplotyping. Chromosomal linkage analysis was performed in one family, and whole-exome sequencing was undertaken in two affected family members from each family. Transactivation activity, DNA binding and nuclear localization of wild type and mutant HNF-1A were assessed. RESULTS: The novel HNF1A variant c.539C&gt;T (p.Ala180Val) was found in both families. The variant fully co-segregated with diabetes in one family. In the other family, two subjects with diabetes mellitus and one with normal glucose levels were homozygous variant carriers. Chromosomal linkage of diabetes to the HNF1A locus or to other genomic regions could not be established. The protein functional studies did not reveal significant differences between wild type and variant HNF-1A. In each family, whole-exome sequencing failed to identify any other variant that could explain the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A variant p.Ala180Val does not seem to cause MODY3, although it may confer risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our data demonstrate challenges in causality evaluation of rare variants detected in known diabetes genes.

28938416|t|Pancreatic Histopathology of Human Monogenic Diabetes Due to Causal Variants in KCNJ11, HNF1A, GATA6, and LMNA.
28938416|a|Context: Monogenic diabetes is thought to account for 2% of all diabetes cases, but most patients receive misdiagnoses of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. To date, little is known about the histopathological features of pancreata from patients with monogenic diabetes. Objective: Retrospective study of the JDRF Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes biorepository to identify possible cases of monogenic diabetes and to compare effects of genetic variants on pancreas histology. Methods: We selected cases of diabetes for genetic testing on the basis of criteria that included young age at diagnosis, low body mass index, negative autoantibody status, and/or detectable C-peptide level. Samples underwent next-generation-targeted sequencing of 140 diabetes/diabetes-related genes. Pancreas weight and histopathology were reviewed. Results: Forty-one of 140 cases of diabetes met the clinical inclusion criteria, with 38 DNA samples available. Genetic variants of probable clinical significance were found in four cases: one each in KCNJ11, HNF1A, GATA6, and LMNA. The KCNJ11 and HNF1A samples had significantly decreased pancreas weight and insulin mass similar to that of type 1 diabetes but had no insulitis. The GATA6 sample had severe pancreatic atrophy but with abundant beta cells and severe amyloidosis similar to type 2 diabetes. The LMNA sample had preserved pancreas weight and insulin mass but abnormal islet architecture and exocrine fatty infiltrates. Conclusions: Four cases of diabetes had putative causal variants in monogenic diabetes genes. This study provides further insight into the heterogeneous nature of monogenic diabetes cases that exhibited clinical and pathophysiological features that overlap with type 1/type 2 diabetes.

29026101|t|Heterozygous RFX6 protein truncating variants are associated with MODY with reduced penetrance.
29026101|a|Finding new causes of monogenic diabetes helps understand glycaemic regulation in humans. To find novel genetic causes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), we sequenced MODY cases with unknown aetiology and compared variant frequencies to large public databases. From 36 European patients, we identify two probands with novel RFX6 heterozygous nonsense variants. RFX6 protein truncating variants are enriched in the MODY discovery cohort compared to the European control population within ExAC (odds ratio = 131, P = 1 x 10-4). We find similar results in non-Finnish European (n = 348, odds ratio = 43, P = 5 x 10-5) and Finnish (n = 80, odds ratio = 22, P = 1 x 10-6) replication cohorts. RFX6 heterozygotes have reduced penetrance of diabetes compared to common HNF1A and HNF4A-MODY mutations (27, 70 and 55% at 25 years of age, respectively). The hyperglycaemia results from beta-cell dysfunction and is associated with lower fasting and stimulated gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels. Our study demonstrates that heterozygous RFX6 protein truncating variants are associated with MODY with reduced penetrance.Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common subtype of familial diabetes. Here, Patel et al. use targeted DNA sequencing of MODY patients and large-scale publically available data to show that RFX6 heterozygous protein truncating variants cause reduced penetrance MODY.

29101032|t|p.Q511L mutation of HNF1alpha in hepatocellular carcinoma suppresses the transcriptional activity and the anti-tumor effect of HNF1alpha.
29101032|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that regulates many aspects of hepatocyte functions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that HNF1alpha has potent therapeutic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in HNF1alpha gene are frequently associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) and hepatocellular adenomas. However, the association of HNF1alpha mutation and HCC remains elusive. In this study, the point mutation of HNF1alpha gene with c.A1532 &gt; T/p.Q511L was identified in an HCC patient by exon-capture high-throughput sequencing. Mutation of c.A1532 &gt; T/p.Q511L in HNF1alpha gene was only detected in the tumor tissue but not in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue of the patient. Luciferase reporter assay and real-time PCR revealed that mutation of p.Q511L reduced the transcriptional activity of HNF1alpha. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fraction analysis revealed that mutation of p.Q511L disturbed the intracellular localization of HNF1alpha in HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of HNF1alpha on the proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells was also partially abolished by the mutation of p.Q511L. Our data suggested that the missense mutation of HNF1alpha (p.Q511L) may associate with the progression of HCC.

29107594|t|Genes Associated with Pancreas Development and Function Maintain Open Chromatin in iPSCs Generated from Human Pancreatic Beta Cells.
29107594|a|Current in vitro islet differentiation protocols suffer from heterogeneity and low efficiency. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from pancreatic beta cells (BiPSCs) preferentially differentiate toward endocrine pancreas-like cells versus those from fibroblasts (FiPSCs). We interrogated genome-wide open chromatin in BiPSCs and FiPSCs via ATAC-seq and identified ~8.3k significant, differential open chromatin sites (DOCS) between the two iPSC subtypes (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05). DOCS where chromatin was more accessible in BiPSCs (Bi-DOCS) were significantly enriched for known regulators of endodermal development, including bivalent and weak enhancers, and FOXA2 binding sites (FDR &lt; 0.05). Bi-DOCS were associated with genes related to pancreas development and beta-cell function, including transcription factors mutated in monogenic diabetes (PDX1, NKX2-2, HNF1A; FDR &lt; 0.05). Moreover, Bi-DOCS correlated with enhanced gene expression in BiPSC-derived definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells. Bi-DOCS therefore highlight genes and pathways governing islet-lineage commitment, which can be exploited for differentiation protocol optimization, diabetes disease modeling, and therapeutic purposes.

29107759|t|The unique clinical spectrum of maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3.
29107759|a|Phenotypic variability in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) makes screening criteria for genomic analysis challenging. We describe the clinical spectrum in a large pedigree with HNF1A-MODY; as generations progressed, the course and outcome became poorer. Although uncommon, pancreatic autoantibodies and diabetes ketoacidosis should not exclude the diagnosis of MODY.
