19799532|t|Influence of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-dynamics of sulfonylurea drugs.
19799532|a|Sulfonylurea drugs including chlorpropamide, gliclazide, tolbutamide, glipizide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and glimepiride are the most widely used oral hypoglycaemic agents in people with type 2 diabetes. This review investigates the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulfonylurea drugs. CYP2C9 is the major enzyme involved in sulfonylurea drug metabolism. CYP2C9 variant allele carriers have significant lower apparent clearance of these medicines. CYP2C19 genotype is more influential for gliclazide pharmacokinetics when compared to CYP2C9. Sulfonylurea pharmacodynamics is affected by several genes. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1, ABCC8 gene) and K+ inward rectifier Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) have been correlated to significant variation in sulfonylurea response. Diabetics with the SUR1 exon 33 G allele are more sensitive to gliclazide and the rs5210 variant of the KCNJ11 gene was associated with improved clinical efficacy of gliclazide. Carriers of Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants are more likely to fail sulfonylurea therapy. On the other hand, patients with HNF-1alpha mutations had a significant greater response to gliclazide when compared to those with type 2 diabetes. The Arg972 polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) may lead to secondary failure of sulfonylurea therapy. Calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) polymorphism has also been linked to sulfonylurea drug response. Despite the available evidence, larger population studies that investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulfonylurea drugs are needed to investigate the influence of key SNPs amidst all potential contributing factors to variability in response to these which inturn will provide information to optimise sulfonylurea use in people with diabetes.

20119856|t|Haplotype association of calpain 10 gene variants with type 2 diabetes mellitus in an Irish sample.
20119856|a|BACKGROUND: Calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). AIM: To examine the contribution of four CAPN10 gene variants to T2DM risk in an Irish sample. METHODS: Genotyping of marker 19 insertion-deletion (ins/del) and three CAPN10 variants, rs3792267, rs3749166 and rs5030952 at the CAPN10 gene was performed in 236 T2DM subjects and 120 controls. Allelic, genotypic and haplotype comparisons were conducted between the groups. RESULTS: In the examined markers, no significant differences were observed although the deletion/deletion allele tended to be more common in T2DM subjects (chi(2) = 3.2, P = 0.07). A significant overrepresentation of a haplotype comprising (rs3792267), (19) and rs3749166 (chi(2) = 5.3, P = 0.021) was seen in T2DM subjects. Two protective haplotypes were detected: (G-ins-G) of (rs3792267), (19) and rs3749166 (chi(2) = 6.7, P = 0.009) and (ins-G-C) of (19), (rs3749166) and rs5030952 (chi(2) = 8.5, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: CAPN10 gene variants may affect T2DM susceptibility in the Irish population.

20142250|t|Diabetes genes and prostate cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.
20142250|a|There is a known inverse association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prostate cancer (PrCa) that is poorly understood. Genetic studies of the T2D-PrCa association may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of this association. We evaluated associations in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study between PrCa and nine T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide association studies of T2D (in CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARG, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and four T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms from pre-genome-wide association studies (in ADRB2, CAPN10, SLC2A2, and UCP2). From 1987 to 2000, there were 397 incident PrCa cases among 6,642 men ages 45 to 64 years at baseline. We used race-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between PrCa and increasing number of T2D risk-raising alleles. PrCa was positively associated with the CAPN10 rs3792267 G allele [hazard ratio (HR) 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.44] and inversely associated with the SLC2A2 rs5400 Thr110 allele (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72, 1.00), the UCP2 rs660339 Val55 allele (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73, 0.97) and the IGF2BP2 rs4402960 T allele (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.02; blacks only). The TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele was inversely associated with PrCa using a dominant genetic model (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97). Further knowledge of T2D gene-PrCa mechanisms may improve understanding of PrCa etiology.

20178008|t|Association of diabetes susceptibility gene calpain-10 with pancreatic cancer among smokers.
20178008|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the association between calpain-10 (CAPN10), a diabetes susceptibility gene, with risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). METHODS: DNA samples from 83 incident exocrine PC cases and 166 controls, all of whom were smokers, were genotyped for four markers of CAPN10 in a nested case-control study based on the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), a randomized chemoprevention trial of subjects at high risk of lung cancer. Controls were matched on sex, race, age, CARET intervention arm, duration of exposure to asbestos, and smoking history. Conditional logistic regression was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The minor allele of SNP-43 (rs3792267) in intron 3 was associated with increased risk of PC with an odds ratio of 1.57 (95%CI 1.03-2.38, p = 0.035) per allele. The three markers of the highest risk haplotype had an odds ratio of 1.98 (95%CI 1.12-3.49, p = 0.019) for risk of PC compared to the most common haplotype. There was no evidence of interaction between either of these associations by diabetes status. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that variation in CAPN10 may be associated with increased risk of PC among smokers. Thus, studies of genes associated with diabetes risk in PC are warranted in a larger population.

20193213|t|[Association between calpain-10 gene polymorphism and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta analysis].
20193213|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to approach the relation of SNP43, SNP44 locus, main haplotypes and haplotype combinations with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: According to the theory and principles of systematic review, data from case-control studies regarding the association between calpain-10 (CAPN10) gene and T2DM were derived through electronic search of PubMed and Chinese journals databases. To gain a more precise estimation of the relationship, a stratified Meta-analysis with four subgroups was performed according to the races. Publication bias was also assessed. RESULTS: The association with T2DM in different races was evaluated. In Mongoloid race, SNP43-G allele, G/G genotype and 111/221 haplotype combination showed notable association with T2DM with ORs (95%CI) as 1.368 (1.155 - 1.620), 1.437 (1.186 - 1.741) and 2.762 (1.287 - 5.927) respectively. In Caucasoid race, SNP44-C allele, 111/111 hapotype combination showed strong relationship with T2DM with ORs (95%CI) as 1.144 (1.023 - 1.278), 1.291(1.050 - 1.586) respectively. In Hybrid race, only one positive finding was obtained which was SNP44-C allele with OR (95%CI) as 1.653 (1.025 - 2.665). CONCLUSION: SNP43-G allele, G/G genotype, 111/221 were risk factors to Mongoloid race. And SNP-C allele, 111/111 haplotype combination were risk factors to Caucasoid race, and SNP44-C allele to Hybrid race.

20368234|t|Co-existence of risk and protective haplotypes of Calpain 10 gene to type 2 diabetes in the eastern Indian population.
20368234|a|Linkage and association studies have detected a role for Calpain-10 (CAPN10) polymorphisms in susceptibility to T2DM in many populations. This study aimed to evaluate possible associations between three SNPs in the CAPN10 (UCSNPs -43, -19 and -63) gene and T2DM in the east Indian population. The distribution of genotype frequency of UCSNP-63 varied significantly between T2DM patients and controls under a dominant model. The uncommon (T) allele (OR = 3.74, 95% CI: 1.44-9.7) of the UCSNP-63 and haplotype 112 (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.17-9.9) were associated with increased risk of T2DM. On the contrary, the most common haplotype 121 (OR = 0.70 95% CI: 0.50-0.99) was associated with a reduced risk for T2DM. In our population a novel 111/112-haplotype combination created by the CAPN10 UCSNP-43, -19 and -63 was associated with risk of T2DM. Haplotypes 112 and 121 with opposite genetic influences also co-exist in our population.

20388922|t|Calpain-10 is a component of the obesity-related quantitative trait locus Adip1.
20388922|a|We previously mapped Adip1, an obesity quantitative trait locus (QTL), to the central portion of murine chromosome 1 containing the calpain-10 (Capn10) gene. Human studies have associated calpain-10 (CAPN10) variants with type 2 diabetes and various metabolic traits. We performed a quantitative hybrid complementation test (QHCT) to determine whether differences attributed to Adip1 are the result of variant Capn10 alleles in LG/J and SM/J mice. We crossed LG/J and SM/J to wild-type (C57BL/6J) and Capn10 knockout (Capn10(-/-)) mice to form four F(1) hybrid groups: LG/J by wild-type, LG/J by Capn10(-/-), SM/J by wild-type, and SM/J by Capn10(-/-). We performed a two-way ANOVA with the experimental strain, tester strain, and their interaction as the factors. Significant interaction indicates a quantitative failure to complement. We found failure to complement for fat, organ, and body weights, and leptin, female free fatty acid, and triglyceride levels. Capn10(-/-) resulted in heavier weights and higher serum levels in LG/J crosses but not in SM/J crosses. For glucose tolerance and insulin response tests, the Capn10(-/-) allele resulted in lower glucose levels in crosses with SM/J but had no effect in the LG/J crosses. Differences between the LG/J and SM/J Capn10 alleles are the likely source of some of the QTL effects mapped to Adip1 in the LG/J-by-SM/J cross. Capn10 plays an important role in regulating obesity and diabetes in mice.

20406624|t|Association of CAPN10 gene with insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and renal function in essential hypertensive patients.
20406624|a|BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension (EH) is a common disorder, which can increase the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Calpain-10 (CAPN10) gene was the first candidate gene of T2D identified through genome-wide linkage and positional cloning, but few works have focused on the relationship of CAPN10 with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in EH patients. METHODS: To identify the effect of UCSNP-43 and UCSNP-44 in CAPN10 gene on susceptibility to IFG/IGT, we conducted a case-control study in 961 EH patients with and without IFG/IGT among Han Chinese population. We also evaluated the impact of two SNPs on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance estimated through oral glucose tolerance test and renal functions by blood chemical assays. RESULTS: The major findings of this study were that UCSNP-43 displayed higher G120 and AUCg. In addition, UCSNP-44 was found associated with IFG/IGT in EH patients, and associated with increased G30, G60, AUCg, Cederholm index, Scr and eGFR. The haplotype UCSNP-43-44 was detected associated with IFG/IGT susceptibility, G60, G120, I0, AUCg, Scr and eGFR by the linear regression with the adjustment for sex, age, BMI, mean blood pressures and ACEI/ARB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided some evidence that CAPN10 gene may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IFG/IGT in EH patients.

20470430|t|Common polymorphisms of calpain-10 and the risk of Type 2 Diabetes in a Tunisian Arab population: a case-control study.
20470430|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic variations in the calpain-10 gene (CAPN10), in particular the at-risk diplotype (112/121), were previously implicated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: We examined the association of CAPN10 UCSNP-43 (rs3792267), UCSNP-19 (rs3842570), and UCSNP-63 (rs5030952) SNPs with T2D in 917 Tunisian T2D patients and 748 non-diabetic controls. CAPN10 genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Enrichment of UCSNP-19 2R (minor) allele and 2R/2R genotype was found in T2D patients; the allele and genotype distribution of UCSNP-43 and UCSNP-63 alleles and genotypes were not significantly different between patient groups and non-diabetic control subjects. Regression analysis demonstrated progressive increases in T2D risk in 3R/2R [OR (95% CI) = 1.35 (1.08 - 1.68)] and 2R/2R [OR (95% CI) = 1.61 (1.20 - 2.18)] genotypes. Of the six haplotypes detected, enrichment of haplotype 111 (UCSNP-43/UCSNP-19/UCSNP-63) was seen in patients (Pc = 0.034); the distribution of the other haplotypes was comparable between patients and control subjects; neither haplotype 211 nor haplotype 212 was observed. Furthermore, the frequency of all CAPN10 diplotypes identified, including the "high-risk diplotype (112/121) reported for Mexican-Americans and Northern Europeans, were comparable between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: CAPN10 UCSNP-19 variant, and the 111 haplotype contribute to the risk of T2D in Tunisian subjects; no significant associations between CAPN10 diplotypes and T2D were demonstrated for Tunisians.

20570542|t|Variants within the calpain-10 gene and relationships with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and T2DM-related traits among Tunisian Arabs.
20570542|a|BACKGROUND: Common variations in the calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene variants UCSNP-43, UCSNP-19 and UCSNP-63, and the 112/121 diplotype, are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and T2DM-related traits. METHODS: The association of UCSNP-43, -19 and -63 CAPN10 SNPs with T2DM was assessed in 917 Tunisian T2DM patients and 748 ethnically matched non-diabetic controls. CAPN10 genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Significant differences in UCSNP-19 MAF, but not UCSNP-43 or -63, and genotype distribution were seen between patients and controls. Heterogeneity in UCSNP-19, but not UCSNP-43 and -63, genotype distribution was noted according to geographical origin. Obesity was associated with UCSNP-19, while raised fasting glucose was associated with UCSNP-63, and increased HDL was associated with UCSNP-43. Enrichment of homozygous UCSNP-19 2/2 was seen in overweight and obese compared with lean patients; logistic-regression analyses demonstrated a positive association of the 2/2 genotype with overweight [P=0.003; OR (95% CI)=2.07 (1.28-3.33)] and obese [P=0.021; OR (95% CI)=1.83 (1.10-3.07)] patients. Of the six CAPN10 haplotypes identified, significant enrichment of only haplotype 111 was seen in T2DM patients [Pc=0.034; OR (95% CI)=1.22 (1.06-1.41)], while the frequency of all identified CAPN10 diplotypes, including the high-risk 112/121, was comparable between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: While CAPN10 UCSNP-19 SNP and haplotype 111 contribute to the risk of T2DM in Tunisian subjects, no significant association between CAPN10 diplotypes and T2DM was demonstrated.

20667559|t|Association of calpain 10 gene polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Southern Indians.
20667559|a|The aim was to investigate the association between the CAPN10 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -44 (rs2975760), -43 (rs3792267), -19 (rs3842570), and -63 (rs5030952) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in an Asian Indian population in Southern India. A total of 1443 subjects, 794 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) and 649 type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects, were randomly selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study. These subjects were genotyped for the 4 CAPN10 SNPs using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and validated by direct sequencing. None of the 4 SNPs showed any significant differences in the genotypic distribution among the NGT and type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects (P = .20, .86, .34, and .39 for SNPs -44, -43, -19, and -63, respectively). The NGT subjects with the 11 genotype of the SNP -63 had significantly higher 2-hour postload plasma glucose (mean +- SD, 5.66 +- 1.05 mmol/L) levels compared with the combined 12 and 22 genotype group (5.33 +- 1.11 mmol/L, P = .004). The P value remained significant even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption (nominal P = .008). No significant difference in the biochemical parameters was observed when the subjects were stratified according to the other SNPs. The 2111 haplotype corresponding to SNPs -44, -43, -19, and -63 showed a significant difference in the proportion among NGT (0.18) and type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects (0.22, nominal P = .014). Although the Bonferroni correction based on the asymptotic test does not preserve this significance, the test based on the empirical distribution remained significant. In conclusion, our study raises the possibility that the 2111 haplotype of SNPs -44, -43, -19, and -63 may be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although none of these SNPs may be individually associated with diabetes.

20923526|t|Ethnic difference in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in inter-East Asian populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on gene polymorphism.
20923526|a|BACKGROUND: We previously reported that the fasting serum insulin level was significantly lower in Japanese patients than in Korean and Chinese patients, and showed evidence that a difference in the dietary component would be one of the most influential factors for the ethnic difference. However, it is well known that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results from the interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental risk factors. Therefore, we investigated ethnic differences by focusing on gene polymorphism, possibly related to T2DM in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese subjects. METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE between January 2001 and October 2008. We conducted a search for articles containing minor allele frequency (MAF) in the gene polymorphisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 (KCNJ11), Calpain 10 (CAPN10), and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2). The pooled odds ratio was calculated by using a fixed-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method after confirming statistical evidence of homogeneity across the ethnicities using the Breslow-Day test. RESULTS: The Breslow-Day test revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between ethnicities in pooled odds ratios for the gene polymorphisms in PPARG (P = 0.828), KCNJ11 (P = 0.194), CAPN10 (P = 0.090), and TCF7L2 (P = 0.376). Also, pooled odds ratios of each gene polymorphism in East Asians were 0.645 for PPARG (P = 0.000), 1.168 for KCNJ11 (P = 0.000), 0.967 for CAPN10 (P = 0.759), and 1.386 for TCF7L2 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study and our previous studies suggest that behavioral and environmental risk factors have a more significant impact on ethnic difference in East Asian patients with T2DM compared with genetic predispositions.

21389182|t|Calpain-10 interacts with plasma saturated fatty acid concentrations to influence insulin resistance in individuals with the metabolic syndrome.
21389182|a|BACKGROUND: Calpain-10 protein (intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease) may play a role in glucose metabolism, pancreatic beta cell function, and regulation of thermogenesis. Several CAPN10 polymorphic sites have been studied for their potential use as risk markers for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Fatty acids are key metabolic regulators that may interact with genetic factors and influence glucose metabolism. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether the genetic variability at the CAPN10 gene locus is associated with the degree of insulin resistance and plasma fatty acid concentrations in subjects with MetS. DESIGN: The insulin sensitivity index, glucose effectiveness, insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], insulin secretion (disposition index, acute insulin response, and HOMA of beta cell function), plasma fatty acid composition, and 5 CAPN10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined in a cross-sectional analysis of 452 subjects with MetS participating in the LIPGENE dietary intervention cohort. RESULTS: The rs2953171 SNP interacted with plasma total saturated fatty acid (SFA) concentrations, which were significantly associated with insulin sensitivity (P &lt; 0.031 for fasting insulin, P &lt; 0.028 for HOMA-IR, and P &lt; 0.012 for glucose effectiveness). The G/G genotype was associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations, lower HOMA-IR, and higher glucose effectiveness in subjects with low SFA concentrations (below the median) than in subjects with the minor A allele (G/A and A/A). In contrast, subjects with the G/G allele with the highest SFA concentrations (above the median) had higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR values and lower glucose effectiveness than did subjects with the A allele. CONCLUSION: The rs2953171 polymorphism at the CAPN10 gene locus may influence insulin sensitivity by interacting with the plasma fatty acid composition in subjects with MetS. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00429195.

21834909|t|A replication study of the IRS1, CAPN10, TCF7L2, and PPARG gene polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes in two different populations of Mexico.
21834909|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic degenerative disease that involves the participation of several genetic and environmental factors. The objective of the study was to determine the association of the IRS1 (rs1801278), CAPN10 (rs3792267), TCF7L2 (rs7903146 and rs12255372), and PPARG (rs1801282) gene polymorphisms with T2D, in two different Mexican populations. We conducted a case-control replication study in the state of Guerrero and in Mexico City, with 400 subjects from Guerrero and 1065 from Mexico City. Data were analyzed by logistic regression, adjusting by ancestry, age, gender, and BMI, to determine the association with T2D. Heterozygosity for the Gly972Arg variant of the IRS1 gene showed the strongest association for T2D in both analyzed samples (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.12-5.26 and 2.64, 95% CI 1.37-5.10, respectively). In addition, an association of two SNPs of the TCF7L2 gene with T2D was observed in both cities: rs7903146, (for Guerrero OR = 1.98 CI95% 1.02-3.89 and for Mexico OR = 1.94 CI95% 1.31-2.88) and rs12255372 (OR = 1.79 CI95% 1.08-2.97, OR = 1.78 CI95% 1.17-2.71 respectively). We suggest that our results provide strong evidence that variation in the IRS1 and TCF7L2 genes confers susceptibility to T2D in our studied populations.

22384174|t|Association of CAPN10 SNPs and haplotypes with polycystic ovary syndrome among South Indian Women.
22384174|a|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is known to be characterized by metabolic disorder in which hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance are central features. Given the physiological overlap between PCOS and type-2 diabetes (T2DM), and calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) being a strong candidate for T2DM, a number of studies have analyzed CAPN10 SNPs among PCOS women yielding contradictory results. Our study is first of its kind to investigate the association pattern of CAPN10 polymorphisms (UCSNP-44, 43, 56, 19 and 63) with PCOS among Indian women. 250 PCOS cases and 299 controls from Southern India were recruited for this study. Allele and genotype frequencies of the SNPs were determined and compared between the cases and controls. Results show significant association of UCSNP-44 genotype CC with PCOS (p = 0.007) with highly significant odds ratio when compared to TC (OR = 2.51, p = 0.003, 95% CI = 1.37-4.61) as well as TT (OR = 1.94, p = 0.016, 95% CI = 1.13-3.34). While the haplotype carrying the SNP-44 and SNP-19 variants (21121) exhibited a 2 fold increase in the risk for PCOS (OR = 2.37, p = 0.03), the haplotype containing SNP-56 and SNP-19 variants (11221) seems to have a protective role against PCOS (OR = 0.20, p = 0.004). Our results support the earlier evidence for a possible role of UCSNP-44 of the CAPN10 gene in the manifestation of PCOS.

22796443|t|Identification of copy number variation of CAPN10 in Thais with type 2 diabetes by multiplex PCR and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).
22796443|a|Copy number variations (CNVs) have been shown to be associated with several diseases. They can cause deviation of genotypes from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Genetic case-control association studies in Thais revealed that genotype distribution of CAPN10 Indel19 was deviated from HWE after correction of genotyping error. Therefore, we aim to identify CNVs within CAPN10 Indel19 region. The semi-quantitative denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) method was used to detect CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 marker in cohort of 305 patients with type 2 diabetes and 250 control subjects without diabetes. CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 was successfully detected by DHPLC. After correction of genotype calling based on the status of identified CNVs, CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes were well-fitted for HWE (p&gt;0.05). However, we did not find association between CNV genotypes and risk of type 2 diabetes in our population. CNVs in CAPN10 have been identified in Thais. These CNVs lead to deviation from HWE of CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes. After excluding identified CNVs from the analysis, CAPN10 Indel19 was associated with type 2 diabetes. The information obtained from our study would be helpful for genotyping accuracies of SNPs residing in the CNVs region.

23021796|t|Calpain-10 gene polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes and its micro- and macrovascular complications.
23021796|a|Genetic variations in the calpain 10 gene (CAPN10) were previously implicated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We studied the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene, SNP -43, SNP -19 and SNP -63, with T2DM and its complications. Overall, we examined 1440 individuals: 880 patients with diabetes and 560 healthy subjects, all Caucasians of Polish origin. All subjects were genotyped for the CAPN10 SNPs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The frequencies of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes at three studied loci were similar between the groups. However, the -43 SNP was significantly more frequent in T2DM patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in patients without CVD (p=0.001). The -43 SNP was still significantly associated with the risk of CVD after adjusting for potential risk factors including male gender, age, BMI, dyslipidemia and hypertension. The odds ratio for G allele for CVD+ versus CVD- patients was 1.89, 95% CI 1.52-2.35. None of the studied SNPs was significantly associated with microvascular diabetic complications. There was a tendency to increased frequency of SNP -43 1/1 homozygotes in patients with diabetic retinopathy (p=0.057). The homozygous haplotype combination 121/121 was more frequent in T2DM patients than in non-diabetic controls (18.4% vs 10.5%, p=0.019). In conclusion, the results of our study suggest the significant association of SNP -43 with the risk of CVD coexisting with T2DM. We also observed that 121/121 haplotype was associated with T2DM in the studied population.

23249316|t|Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes: a global meta-analysis studying the genetic differences in Tunisian populations.
23249316|a|The present study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate type 2 diabetes (T2D)- associated polymorphisms in cohorts originated from several Tunisian regions. In fact, we evaluated the effect of seven polymorphisms in the following genes-PPARg (Pro12Ala), TNFalpha (-308A/G), ENPP1(K121Q), TCF7L2(rs7903146 C/T), MTHFR(C677T), ACE(I/D), and CAPN10(3R/2R)-on T2D risk, through a meta-analysis combining data of previous studies performed on Tunisian populations originating from the north, center, or south of the country. R statistics version 2.12.1 software was used to estimate the heterogeneity between studies. Pooled odds ratios were computed by the fixed-effects method of Mantel-Haenszel if no heterogeneity between studies exists. Despite the similarities founded in a number of loci, the Woolf test reported that the contributions of ENPP1 and ACE loci in T2D risk are dependent on the geographic origin of concerned groups, and this heterogeneity could be attributed not only to the variable contribution of the variant in T2D risk but also to diversities of genetic background between tested groups. Interestingly, observed heterogeneity highlighted founding concerning Y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA about the genetic structure of Tunisian population and proves once again that Tunisians, like the north-Africans, are a mosaic of subpopulations, with significant differences in genetic structure. In homogeneous groups, we replicated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TCF7L2, MTHFR, CAPN 10, TNFalpha, and ACE genes with a T2D risk in the Tunisian population with OR ranging from 1.43 to 6.72. However, we reported an absence of the association of PPARg with T2D in the Tunisian population.

23262350|t|The reduction of Calpain-10 expression is associated with risk polymorphisms in obese children.
23262350|a|Excessive weight gain and obesity are major public health concerns. Childhood obesity is growing at an alarming rate. Polymorphisms in the Calpain-10 gene and the reduced expression of this gene in muscle cells and adipocytes have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in several populations. In the present study, we explored the contribution of Calpain-10 in the development of metabolic impairment in childhood. We evaluated the presence of risk polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene (SNP-44, SNP-43, InDel-19 and SNP-63) and the associated changes in the Calpain-10 mRNA levels in a pediatric population. A total of 161 Mexican children between 4 and 18 years old were included in this study. This population was classified into three groups according to international growth references: healthy weight (HW), overweight (OW) and obese (OB). Association studies of the anthropometric data, clinical values, genotyping and expression assays showed a decrease in the Calpain-10 mRNA and protein expression in the OW and OB groups with respect to the HW group. This decrease in the Calpain-10 mRNA expression was more evident in individuals homozygous for SNP-44 (T/T) and InDel-19 (3/3), alone (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.015, respectively) or in combination (p=0.017). These polymorphisms were also associated with elevated BMI, weight percentiles, z-scores, waist circumferences, fasting glucose levels and beta cell functions in the OW and OB groups (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, our results indicate a statistically significant decrease in the expression of the 75-kDa Calpain-10 isoform in the OW+OB group. The presence of polymorphisms and alterations in the expression of the CAPN10 gene at early ages might result in metabolic impairment in adulthood and should be further investigated.

24034724|t|Analysis of the structure of calpain-10 and its interaction with the protease inhibitor SNJ-1715.
24034724|a|Calpain-10 (CAPN10) is a cysteine protease that is activated by intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) and known to be involved in diseases such as cancer, heart attack, and stroke. A role for the CAPN10 gene in diabetes mellitus type II was recently identified. Hyper activation of the enzyme initiates a series of destructive cycles that can cause irreversible damage to cells. The development of inhibitors may be useful as therapeutic agents for a number of calpainopathies. In this paper, we have used the homology modelling technique to determine the 3D structure of calpain-10 from Homo sapiens. The model of calpain-10 obtained by homology modelling suggests that its active site is conserved among family members and the main interactions are similar to those observed for mu-calpain. Structural analysis revealed that there are small differences in the charge distribution and molecular surface of the enzyme. These differences are probably less dependent on calcium for calpain-10 than they are for mu-calpain. In addition, the ion pair Cys(-)/His(+) formation was observed using of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations that were based upon hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approaches. Finally, the binding of the SNJ-1715 inhibitor to calpain-10 was investigated in order to further understand the mechanism of inhibition of calpain-10 by this inhibitor at the molecular level.

24059590|t|The TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T) allele is associated with type 2 diabetes in urban Ghana: a hospital-based case-control study.
24059590|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, and genetic predisposition is likely involved in that. Yet, genetic variants known to confer increased susceptibility among Caucasians are far from being established in African populations. In Ghanaian adults, we examined associations of several of these polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study on type 2 diabetes (and hypertension) was conducted in Kumasi, Ghana. TCF7L2 rs7903146, KCNJ11 rs5219, PPARgamma rs1801282 and CAPN10 rs3842570, rs3792267, and rs5030952 were typed and associations with type 2 diabetes and phenotypic traits examined. RESULTS: 675 patients with type 2 diabetes and 377 controls were compared. The minor allele frequency of the TCF7L2 (T) allele was 0.33. In the multivariate model, this allele increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 39% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.81; p = 0.014). The minor alleles KCNJ11 (G) and PPARgamma (G) were practically absent (each, 0.001). Minor allele frequencies of CAPN10 were for -43 (A) 0.11 and for -63 (C) 0.46. These variants showed no significant associations with type 2 diabetes. Two CAPN10 haplotypes tended to protect against type 2 diabetes: 211 (aOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.03-1.92; p = 0.31) and 221 (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10; p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: In urban Ghana, the frequency of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T) allele is comparable to the one in Caucasians; the association with type 2 diabetes is slightly weaker. The risk allele KCNJ11 (G) and the protective allele PPARgamma (G) are virtually absent. The potential influence of comparatively rare CAPN10 haplotypes on type 2 diabetes risk in this population requires further evaluation. Large-scale genetic studies among native Africans aiming at fine-mapping the candidate genes are needed to identify the actual factors involved in their increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

24266779|t|Variation in the calpain-10 gene is not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus.
24266779|a|BACKGROUND: In several large studies an association between certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has been identified. Since T2D and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) seem to be linked pathophysiologically, we examined the frequencies of CAPN10-polymorphisms in women with GDM. METHODS: By using real-time PCR assisted melting curve analysis samples of 204 women with GDM and 297 controls were tested for variations of SNP-43, -44, -63 and Indel-19 of CAPN10. RESULTS: Since the genotype frequencies found in SNP-44 among the controls did not meet the Hardy-Weinberg-Equilibrium, the further analysis was performed with SNP-43, -63 and Indel-19 only. Herein, the distribution of neither genotype nor allele nor haplogenotype-combination nor haplotype showed a significant difference between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Variations of SNP-43, -63 and Indel-19 of CAPN10 were not associated with an increased risk of developing GDM.

24429295|t|Ethnic differences in CAPN10 SNP-19 in type 2 diabetes: a North-West Indian case control study and evidence from meta-analysis.
24429295|a|Summary Calpain 10 (CAPN10) variants have been associated with the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the present case-control study, we analysed the distribution of SNP-19 insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in a total of 607 samples (103 T2D cases and 102 healthy controls) from Brahmin; (100 T2D cases and 100 healthy controls) from Bania and (100 T2D cases and 102 healthy controls) from Jat Sikh ethnic groups of the North-West Indian population. Increased frequency of I allele and II genotype was found in T2D in Brahmin ethnic group [P = 0 003, OR = 2 83 (1 43-5 61 at 95% CI)]. Significant correlation between II genotype and body mass index (BMI) was also observed [P = 0 003, OR = 3 31 (1 52-7 20 at 95% CI)]. No association for the genotypes and alleles was seen in Banias and Jat Sikhs. Our data suggests that SNP-19 I/D variation in the CAPN10 gene is modulated by ethnicity and influences the susceptibility to T2D in the North-West Indian population. We also performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies to assess the validity of this association. Data from 13 case-control studies with 15 760 samples comprising of 8395 T2D cases and 7365 controls were finally analysed. Significant heterogeneity between individual studies was evident in dominant and codominant models. The results of present meta-analysis indicate an association of T2D with carriers of DD genotype of CAPN10 I/D polymorphism. However, further analyses on a larger sample size are required to establish a conclusive association in meta-analysis.

24508288|t|Role of calpain-10 in the development of diabetes mellitus and its complications.
24508288|a|Calpain activity has been implicated in several cellular processes such as cell signaling, apoptosis, exocytosis, mitochondrial metabolism and cytoskeletal remodeling. Evidence has indicated that the impairment of calpain expression and the activity of different calpain family members are involved in diverse pathologies. Calpain-10 has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes, and polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing this disease. The present work focused on the molecular biology of calpain-10, supporting its key participation in glucose metabolism. Current knowledge regarding the role of calpain-10 in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes-related diseases is additionally reviewed.

24612564|t|Association of IRS1, CAPN10, and PPARG gene polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the high-risk population of Hyderabad, India.
24612564|a|BACKGROUND: We attempted to validate earlier findings on the nature of the association of the IRS1, CAPN10, and PPARG genes with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the high-risk population of Hyderabad, India. METHODS: A sample of 1379 subjects (758 T2DM patients, 621 controls) was genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IRS1 (rs1801278), CAPN10 (rs3792267, rs5030952), and PPARG (rs1801282) genes. RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of IRS1 (rs1801278) and CAPN10 (rs3792267) SNPs differed significantly between the patient and control groups. Logistic regression analysis suggested a significant association of these two SNPs (P &lt;= 0.007) with T2DM and the strength of association did not alter when adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, and the waist : hip ratio as covariates. The same two SNPs showed significant association in multivariate logistic regression analyses, even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, suggesting an independent nature of the role of these genes in the manifestation of T2DM in our population. CONCLUSIONS: We replicated the significant association of rs1801278 and rs3792267 SNPs of the IRS1 and CAPN10 genes with T2DM in the population of Hyderabad. Despite the known biological significance of the PPARG gene and a sufficient statistical power of the present study, we could not replicate the association of PPARG with T2DM in our high-risk population. Given the vast ethnic, geographic, and genetic heterogeneity of the Indian population, many more studies are needed covering the ethnic and geographic heterogeneity of India to enable identification of an Indian-specific profile of genes associated with T2DM.

24630865|t|The calpain system and diabetes.
24630865|a|Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a clinical syndrome that is characterized by hyperglycemia due to deficiency of insulin. The global prevalence of diabetes has been estimated to increase from 4% (1995) to 5.4% by the year 2025. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM/Type-1) in human, generating hyperglycemia due to insulin deficiency as a consequence of destructing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM/Type-II), is a multifactorial, exact biochemical and genetic defect which has not yet been elucidated completely. Calpains seem to play a role in NIDDM and IDDM. Positional cloning experiments revealed that there is a NIDDM susceptibility to calpain 10 (CAPN10). Increased calpain activity and leukocyte trafficking were noticed in the microcirculation in ZDF (Zuker diabetic fatty) rats. Exercise and low body weight play a significant role in reducing calpains expression or elevating the calpains degradation in the skeletal muscle of NIDDM rats. Numerous investigations have been reported that non-coding polymorphisms in CAPN10 proteins might be involved in the NIDDM. Calpain and its mRNA presence had been reported in tissues from many mammalian species. CAPN10 and other calpains seem to be linked to glucose metabolism, insulin secretion and action pathways. This review will give an overview of the role of calpain in NIDDM and IDDM.

24779302|t|A case-control study on the association of common variants of CAPN10 gene and the risk of type 2 diabetes in an Iranian population.
24779302|a|BACKGROUND: Calpain-10 is a ubiquitously expressed protease that serves as an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease and is regarded to be one of the candidate genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify the association of the common variants of this gene and the risk of T2DM in the Kurdish ethnic group of Iran. METHODS: Study groups included 173 T2DM and 173 normoglycemic subjects. Genotyping was determined by PCR-RFLP. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were then evaluated. Data was analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The allelic frequency of the A-allele of SNP-43 variant was significantly different (p = 0.01) between case and control groups (18% vs. 11%). The genotype frequencies for SNP-43 did not show any significant difference between case and control individuals. However, the dominant model of SNP-43 was found to be significantly associated with T2DM (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 - 2.89, p &lt; 0.029). The distribution and allele frequency of other SNPs (SNP-19 and -63) did not show any significant difference between the study groups. For SNP-43, fasting serum insulin (p = 0.043) and HOMA-IR (p = 0.026) were higher in the control subjects with the GA+AA genotype when compared with the GG genotype. Among the T2DM subjects, there was no significant difference in any of the clinical or biochemical parameters between the GG and GA+AA genotypes of SNP-43. Normoglycemic subjects carrying the 2R/3R+3R/3R genotypes of SNP-19 had significantly lower HDL-C (p = 0.034) as compared with those with the 2R/2R genotype. In T2DM subjects, no significant difference was found in any of the clinical or biochemical parameters between 2R/2R and 2R/3R+3R/3R genotypes. T2DM subjects carrying the CT+TT genotypes of SNP-63 variation had significantly higher LDL-C (p = 0.015) as compared with those with the CC genotype. In normoglycemic subjects, no significant difference was found in any of the clinical or biochemical parameters between CC and CT+TT genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that there is an association between the SNP-43, but not SNP-19 and -63, and T2DM in the Kurdish ethnic group of West Iran.

24993573|t|Utility of large consanguineous family-based model for investigating the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
24993573|a|OBJECTIVES: This study examined the utility of a family-based model for replicating the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS AND RESULTS: In a total of 232 members of a large consanguineous Omani Arab pedigree (age: 16-80years), there were 27 diabetics and 50 prediabetics (17 with impaired fasting glucose and 33 with impaired glucose tolerance). All 232 individuals underwent anthropometric and biochemical investigations and genotyped for 14 known common gene variants of modest effect on T2D risk. Power analysis at a LOD score of 3, gave 80% power to locate a single specific locus that accounts for 52% of the total phenotypic variation. Measured genotype analysis (MGA) was used to determine heritability of various quantitative traits (QTs) which ranged 25-56%. Using MGA, some common gene variants were found to have little (&lt;5%) but significant impact on the heritability of T2D related QTs [KCNJ11 (rs5219), p=0.004]; [IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), p=0.02]; [SLC30A8 (rs13266634), p=0.05]; [CAPN10 (rs2975760), p=0.031]; [FTO (rs8050136), p=0.023]; [FTO (rs9939609), p=0.018] and [SLC30A8 (rs13266634), p=0.05]. Sib-TDT analysis showed that some gene variants were significantly associated with T2D risk but didn't reach the level of significance after Bonferroni correction [KCNJ11 (rs5219), p=0.047] and [CAPN10 (rs41266971), p=0.035]. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that, in principle, a family-based model with minor limitations could be used to replicate some of the results of large GWAS case-control studies. This model could successfully be applied for the future discovery, by deep sequencing, of rare gene variants.

25238846|t|A genetic variant of the CAPN10 gene in Mexican subjects with dyslipidemia is associated with increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations after the consumption of a soy protein and soluble fiber dietary portfolio.
25238846|a|Dyslipidemia is a major public health problem, and therefore, it is important to develop dietary strategies to diminish the prevalence of this disorder. It was recently reported that diet may play an important role in triggering insulin resistance by interacting with genetic variants at the CAPN10 gene locus in patients with metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, it remains unknown whether genetic variants of genes involved in the development of type 2 diabetes are associated with variations in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The study used a single-center, prospective, cohort design. Here, we assessed the effect of four variants of the CAPN10 gene on HDL-C levels in response to a soy protein and soluble fiber dietary portfolio in subjects with dyslipidemia. In 31 Mexican dyslipidemic individuals, we analyzed four CAPN10 gene variants (rs5030952, rs2975762, rs3792267, and rs2975760) associated with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with the GG genotype of the rs2975762 variant of the CAPN10 gene were better responders to dietary intervention, showing increased HDL-C concentrations from the first month of treatment. HDL-C concentrations in participants with the wild type genotype increased by 17.0%, whereas the HDL-C concentration in subjects with the variant genotypes increased by only 3.22% (p = 0.03); the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of GG carriers tended to decrease (-12.6%). These results indicate that Mexican dyslipidemic carriers of the rs2975762-GG genotype are better responders to this dietary intervention.

25327507|t|A pharmacogenetic association between a variation in calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene and the response to metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.
25327507|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate possible associations of the single-nucleotide variants in six genes encoding the key molecules mediating the metformin pharmacodynamic effect with the response to treatment with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred forty-eight drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. PRKAA1 rs249429, STK11 rs741765, PCK1 rs4810083, PPARGC1A rs10213440, HNF1A rs11086926, and CAPN10 rs3792269 variants were genotyped. The outcomes of the study were treatment success defined by achieving HbA1c &lt;7 % and absolute reduction in HbAlc after 6-month metformin therapy. The relationships between genotypes and outcomes were evaluated in multivariate logistic and linear models. The level of statistical significance after Bonferroni correction was predefined as p&lt;0.0083. RESULTS: The minor G-allele of CAPN10 rs3792269 A&gt;G polymorphism was significantly associated with less treatment success with an odds ratio of 0.27 (95 % CI 0.12-0.62, p=0.002) per variant allele. When the reduction in HbA1c was analyzed as a quantitative trait, G-allele was nominally associated with a smaller reduction in HbA1c (per allele beta=-0.26, 95 % CI -0.50 to -0.02, p=0.032). The reduction in HbA1c in minor allele carriers (24 % of study population) was smaller by 0.3 % in comparison with the major allele homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the first observation of an association between a variant in CAPN10 gene and the response to metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. This observation needs to be replicated in further studies in different populations.

25382134|t|CAPN10 SNP43 G&gt;A gene polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Asian population: a meta-analysis of 9353 participants.
25382134|a|A correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)43 G&gt;A in the calpain-10 (CAPN10) gene (i.e., CAPN10 SNP43) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility has been suggested, but the evidence for such a relationship remains controversial. To explore the association of the CAPN10 SNP43 with T2DM in Asian populations, a meta-analysis including 9,353 participants from 20 individual studies in Asian populations was conducted. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were evaluated by a fixed-effect model or random-effect model. The relationship between CAPN10 SNP43 and T2DM was significant under allelic (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.38, P = 0.03), recessive (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.038-1.472, P =0.017), heterozygous (OR: 1.261, 95% CI: 1.053-1.512, P = 0.012), and additive (OR: 1.183, 95% CI: 1.014-1.381, P = 0.033) genetic models but not under dominant (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.78-1.62, P = 0.53) or homozygous (OR: 0.937, 95% CI: 0.648-1.355, P = 0.730) genetic models. CAPN10 SNP43 was significantly associated with T2DM susceptibility in Asian populations, especially in Chinese populations. Asians, particularly Chinese people with the SNP43 G allele of the CAPN10 gene may have an increased risk of developing T2DM.

25419435|t|Association of calpain-10 rs2975760 polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.
25419435|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for the majority of diabetes cases and affects a significant proportion of the adult population worldwide. Calpain-10 has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes, and some polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing this disease. Several molecular epidemiological studies were conducted in recent years to evaluate the association between the CAPN10 rs2975760 polymorphism and T2DM risk in diverse populations. However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. We performed a meta-analysis of 8 case-control studies that included 2758 T2DM cases and 2762 case-free controls. We assessed the strength of the association, using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confi dence intervals (CIs). Overall, this meta-analysis showed that the CAPN10 rs2975760 polymorphism was not associated with a significantly type 2 diabetes risk in three genetic models. However, after excluding two study for its heterogeneity, a significantly increased risk was found in all comparisons (for C vs T: OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.03-1.27, I (2)=0, P heterpgeneity=0.420, P b=0.012; for TC vs TT: OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.01-1.30, I (2)=3.8%, P heterpgeneity=0.392, P b=0.030; for CC+TC vs TT: OR=1.16, 95% CI=1.03-1.31, I (2)=3.7%, P heterpgeneity=0.393, P b=0.015). No publication bias was found in the present study. This meta-analysis suggests that the C allele of the CAPN10 rs2975760 polymorphism is associated with an increased T2DM risk. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confi rm this association.

25606412|t|Investigation of Calpain 10 (rs2975760) gene polymorphism in Asian Indians with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
25606412|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are part of a heterogeneous and complex metabolic group of disorders that share common pathophysiological circumstances, including beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. The protein Calpain 10 (CAPN10) plays a role in glucose metabolism, pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion, and thermogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) based genotyping of CAPN10 (rs2975760) polymorphism was carried out in T2DM and GDM with suitable controls for each of the pathologies from the same population. Genomic DNA was isolated from 787 participants, including 250 cases of T2DM, 287 pregnant women, of which 137 were identified as having GDM and the remaining 150 were confirmed as non-GDM, and 250 healthy control volunteers, and association analysis was carried out for genotypes and alleles. RESULTS: In the present study, T2DM was compared with healthy controls and was not found to be associated with the CAPN10 C allele (odds ratio, OR: 1.09; 95% CI = 0.8011-1.484; p = 0.5821). GDM also did not show any association when compared with non-GDM (OR: 1.124; 95% CI = 0.7585-1.667; p = 0.5606) respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the CAPN10 (rs2975760) polymorphism scrutinized in this study is not associated with T2DM and GDM.

25617558|t|[SNP-19 genotypic variants of CAPN10 gene and its relation to diabetes mellitus type 2 in a population of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico].
25617558|a|INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type 2 is a common pathology with multifactorial etiology, which exact genetic bases remain unknown. Some studies suggest that single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CAPN10 gene (Locus 2q37.3) could be associated with the development of this disease, including the insertion/deletion polymorphism SNP-19 (2R 3R). OBJECTIVE: The present study determined the association between the SNP-19 and the risk of developing DM type 2 in Ciudad Juarez population. METHODOLOGY: For this study 107 participants were selected: 43 diabetics type 2 (cases) and 64 non diabetics with no family history of DM type 2 in first grade (control). Anthropometric studies were realized as well as lipids, lipoproteins and serum glucose biochemical profiles. The genotypification of SNP-19 was performed using peripheral blood lymphocytes DNA, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), and electrophoretic analysis in agarose gels. Once obtained the genotypic and allelic frequencies, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test (GenAlEx 6.4) was also performed. RESULTS: Using the X2 analysis it was identified the genotypic differences between cases and control with higher frequency of the homozygous genotype 3R of SNP- 19 in the cases group (0.418) compared to control group (0.265). Also, it was observed an association between genotype 2R/3R with elevated weight, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences, but only in the diabetic group (P=&lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings in this study suggest that SNP-19 in CAPN10 may participate in the development of DM type 2 in the studied population.

METHODS: Using case-control design, a total of 992 diabetic patients and 294 normoglycemic Omani Arabs were genotyped, by an allelic discrimination assay-by-design TaqMan method on fast real time polymerase chain reaction system, for the following gene variants: KCNJ11 (rs5219), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), CDKAL1 (rs10946398), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), FTO (rs9939609 and rs8050136), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), SLC30A8 (rs13266634) CAPN10 (rs3792267) and HHEX (rs1111875). T2D patients were recruited from the Diabetes Clinic (n = 243) and inpatients (n = 749) at Sultan Qaboos Univesity Hospital (SQUH), Muscat, Oman. Adult control participants (n = 294) were volunteers from the community and from those visiting Family Medicine Clinic at SQU, for regular medical checkup. The difficulty in recruiting Omani participants with no family history of diabetes was the main reason behind the small number of control participants in this study. Almost all volunteers questioned had a relative with diabetes mellitus. Inspite of the small number of normoglycemic controls in this study, this sample was sufficient for detection of genes and loci for common alleles influencing T2D with an odds ratio of &gt;= 1.3 reaching at least 80% power. Data was collected from June 2010 to February 2012. RESULTS: Using binary logistic regression analysis, four gene variants showed significant association with T2D risk: KCNJ11 (rs5219, P = 5.8 x 10(-6), OR = 1.74), TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 0.001, OR = 1.46), CDKAL1 (rs10946398, P = 0.002, OR = 1.44) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 0.020, OR = 1.40). The fixation index analysis of these four gene variants indicated significant genetic differentiation between diabetics and controls {[KCNJ11 (rs5219), P &lt; 0.001], [TCF7L2 (rs7903146), P &lt; 0.001], [CDKAL1 (rs10946398), P &lt; 0.05], [CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), P &lt; 0.05]}. The highest genotype variation % between diabetics and controls was found at KCNJ11 (2.07%) and TCF7L2 (1.62%). This study was not able to detect an association of T2D risk with gene variants of IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), CAPN10 (rs3792267) and HHEX (rs1111875). Moreover, no association was found between FTO gene variants (rs9939609 and rs8050136) and T2D risk. However, T2D risk was found to be significantly associated with obesity (P = 0.002, OR = 2.22); and with the Waist-to-Hip ratio (n = 532, P = 1.9 x10(-7), OR = 2.4), [among males (n = 234, P = 1.2 x 10(-4), OR = 2.0) and females (n = 298, P = 0.001, OR = 6.3)]. CONCLUSION: Results confirmed the association of KCNJ11 (rs5219), TCF7L2 (rs7903146), CDKAL1 (rs10946398) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661) gene variants with susceptibility to T2D among Omani Arabs.

25982606|t|[Association analysis of SNP-63 and indel-19 variant in the calpain-10 gene with polycystic ovary syndrome in women of reproductive age].
25982606|a|BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex and heterogeneous disease involving both reproductive and metabolic problems. It has been suggested a genetic predisposition in the etiology of this syndrome. The identification of calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) as the first candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus, has focused the interest in investigating their possible relation with the polycystic ovary syndrome, because this syndrome is associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, two metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if there is association between the SNP-63 and the variant indel-19 of the CAPN10 gene and polycystic ovary syndrome in women of reproductive age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 101 women (55 with polycystic ovary syndrome and 46 without polycystic ovary syndrome). The genetic variant indel-19 was identified by electrophoresis of the amplified fragments by PCR, and the SNP-63 by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of the two variants do not differ significatly between women with polycystic ovary syndrome and control women group. The haplotype 21 (defined by the insertion allele of indel-19 variant and C allele of SNP-63) was found with higher frequency in both study groups, being more frequent in the polycystic ovary syndrome patients group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.8353). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that SNP-63 and indel-19 variant of the CAPN10 gene do not represent a risk factor for polycystic ovary syndrome in our patients group.

26042206|t|Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Hyderabad, India.
26042206|a|Fifteen SNPs from nine different genes were genotyped on 1379 individuals, 758 T2DM patients and 621 controls, from the city of Hyderabad, India, using Sequenom Massarray platform. These data were analyzed to examine the role of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in the manifestation of T2DM. The multivariate analysis suggests that TCF7L2, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, HHEX and PPARG genes are significantly associated with T2DM, albeit only the first two of the above 5 were associated in the univariate analysis. Significant gene-gene and gene-environment interactions were also observed with reference to TCF7L2, CAPN10 and CDKAL1 genes, highlighting their importance in the pathophysiology of T2DM. In the analysis for cumulative effect of risk alleles, SLC30A8 steps in as significant contributor to the disease by its presence in all combinations of risk alleles. A striking difference between risk allele categories, 1-4 and 5-6, was evident in showing protective and susceptible roles, respectively, while the latter was characterized by the presence of TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 variants. Overall, these two genes TCF7L2 and CDKAL1 showed strong association with T2DM, either individually or in interaction with the other genes. However, we need further studies on gene-gene and gene-environment interactions among heterogeneous Indian populations to obtain unequivocal conclusions that are applicable for the Indian population as a whole.

26543536|t|Detection of CAPN10 copy number variation in Thai patients with type 2 diabetes by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
26543536|a|AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with complex human diseases. However, CNVs can cause genotype deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). A genetic case-control association study in 216 Thai diabetic patients and 192 non-diabetic controls found that, after excluding genotyping errors, genotype distribution of calpain 10 (CAPN10) SNP44 (rs2975760) deviated from HWE. Here, we aimed to detect CNV within the CAPN10 SNP44 region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CNV within the CAPN10 SNP44 region was detected using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and the results confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with SYBR Green I. RESULTS: Both methods successfully identified CNV in the CAPN10 SNP44 region, obtaining concordant results. Correction of genotype calling based on the status of identified CNVs showed that the CAPN10 SNP44 genotype is in good agreement with HWE (P &gt; 0.05). However, no association between CNV genotypes and risk of type 2 diabetes was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Identified CNVs for CAPN10 SNP44 genotypes lead to deviation from HWE. Furthermore, both denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction are useful for detecting CNVs.

26937418|t|Candidate gene analysis supports a role for polymorphisms at TCF7L2 as risk factors for type 2 diabetes in Sudan.
26937418|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is multifactorial. A growing number of genes have been identified as risk factors for T2D across multiple ethnicities in trans-ancestry meta-analysis of large-scale genome-wide association studies. Few studies have looked at these genes in Sub-Saharan African populations. This study was undertaken to look for associations between T2D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of the top candidate genes in a selected Sudanese population. METHODS: A total 240 T2D cases and 128 unrelated healthy control subjects were included in this study. Age, sex, weight and height were recorded, blood pressure and biochemical profiles of glucose and lipids were analysed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY  system. Fourteen SNPs were selected across 7 genes: CAPN10 (rs2975760 and rs5030952), PPARG (rs17036314 and rs1801282), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960 and rs1470579), CDKAL1 (rs9465871), HHEX (rs1111875), TCF7L2 (rs7903146, rs11196205 and rs12255372), and KCNJ11 (rs5215, rs1800467 and rs5219). Allelic and haplotype association analyses were performed under additive models in PLINK. P &lt;= 0.007 (=0.05/7 genes) was the P-value required to achieve correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: A significant genetic association between the SNPs rs7903146 (odds ratio 1.69, 95 % confidence interval 1.21-2.38, P = 0.002) and rs12255372 (odds ratio 1.70, 95 % confidence interval 1.20-2.41, P = 0.003) at TCF7L2 and T2D was found in Sudanese population. These associations were retained after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (e.g. rs7903146: odds ratio 1.70, P adj:age/sex/BMI = 0.005). The strongest haplotype association (odds ratio 2.24; P adj:age/sex/BMI = 0.0003) comprised the two point haplotype T_C across rs7903146 and rs11196205. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that SNP rs7903146 added significant main effects to rs11196205 or rs12255372, whereas the reverse was not true, indicating that the main effect for association with T2D in this population is most strongly tagged by SNP rs7903146. Adjusted analyses also provided support for protection from T2D associated with minor alleles at SNPs rs2975760 at CAPN10 (odds ratio 0.44, 95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.97, P adj:age/sex/BMI = 0.042) and rs1111876 at HHEX (odds ratio 0.60, 95 % confidence interval 0.39- 0.93, P adj:age/sex/BMI = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Multiethnic associations between T2D and SNPs at TCF7L2, CAPN10 and HHEX extend to Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically Sudan.

27324783|t|Meta-analysis of the association between four CAPN10 gene variants and gestational diabetes mellitus.
27324783|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of the meta-analysis is to evaluate the association between calpain-10 (CANP10) gene polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A computer-based retrieval was performed in Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases for eligible studies. The genotype data from four variants in CANP10 [single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 19, 43, 44, and 63] were collected. The pooled Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were conducted for five genetic models. RESULTS: Five studies containing 1003 GDMs and 1788 controls are included in this meta-analysis. The overall combined odds ratios show that SNP 19 and SNP 43 are not associated with increased risk of GDM in all genetic models. The association between SNP 63 and GDM is only significant in the heterozygous model (OR 2.79, 95 % CI 1.15-6.74). The SNP 44 is associated with increased risk of GDM in the recessive model (OR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.07-2.85), but only two studies are included. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that women carriage of TT genotype in SNP 63 (rs5030952) is associated with increased risk in GDM.

27374856|t|The Uyghur population and genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes: potential role for variants in CAPN10, APM1 and FUT6 genes.
27374856|a|Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified over 70 loci associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in multiple populations of European ancestry. However, the risk attributable to an individual variant is modest and does not yet provide convincing evidence for clinical utility. Association between these established genetic variants and T2DM in general populations is hitherto understudied in the isolated populations, such as the Uyghurs, resident in Hetian, far southern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. In this case-control study, we genotyped 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 10 genes associated with diabetes in 130 cases with T2DM and 135 healthy controls of Uyghur, a Chinese minority ethnic group. Three of the 13 SNPs demonstrated significant association with T2DM in the Uyghur population. There were significant differences between the T2DM patients and controls in the risk allele distributions of rs3792267 (CAPN10) (P = 0.002), rs1501299 (APM1) (P = 0.017), and rs3760776 (FUT6) (P = 0.031). Allelic carriers of rs3792267-A, rs1501299-T, and rs3760776-T had a 2.24-fold [OR (95% CI): 1.35-3.71], 0.59-fold [OR (95% CI): 0.39-0.91], 0.57-fold [OR (95% CI): 0.34-0.95] increased risk for T2DM respectively. We further confirmed that the cumulative risk allelic scores calculated from the 13 susceptibility loci for T2DM differed significantly between the T2DM patients and controls (P = 0.001), and the effect of obesity/overweight on T2DM was only observed in the subjects with a combined risk allelic score under a value of 17. This study observed that the SNPs rs3792267 in CAPN10, rs1501299 in APM1, and rs3760776 in FUT6 might serve as potential susceptible biomarkers for T2DM in Uyghurs. The cumulative risk allelic scores of multiple loci with modest individual effects are also significant risk factors in Uyghurs for T2DM, particularly among non-obese individuals. This is the first investigation having observed/found genetic variations on genetic loci functionally linked with glycosylation associated with the risk of T2DM in a Uyghur population.

28139539|t|Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus genes in polycystic ovary syndrome aetiology among women from southern India.
28139539|a|BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder of premenopausal women. Given the phenotypic overlap between PCOS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), this study was carried out to investigate whether genes implicated in T2DM were also involved in the susceptibility to PCOS among women from southern India. METHODS: A total of 248 women with PCOS and 210 healthy women as controls were genotyped for a panel of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nine T2DM genes, such as TCF7L2, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, CDKN2A, IRS1, CAPN10 and PPARG, on Sequenom MassARRAY platform. RESULTS: None of the 15 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with PCOS after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, either in the univariate or multivariate context. The cumulative effect of risk alleles observed with reference to T2DM was also not seen with reference to PCOS. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: The nine T2DM genes considered in this exploratory study might not be the primary susceptibility factors for PCOS among Indian women. Our results supplement the lack of evidence of the association of T2DM genes with PCOS among the Chinese and Caucasians hinting at the possible universality of this pattern. Specifically designed comprehensive studies that include women with T2DM and PCOS are required to explore the precise role of the diabetes genes.

28277135|t|TCF7L2, CAPN10 polymorphisms are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risks: a meta-analysis.
28277135|a|Several polymorphisms have been identified in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), and calpain-10 (CAPN10) genes. Controversial conclusions for the genetic relationship between these polymorphisms and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risks were obtained. Our study aims at assessing whether these polymorphisms are associated with GDM susceptibility via a meta-analysis. A total of 19 eligible case-control articles were obtained after databases searching. A significantly increased GDM risk was observed for TCF7L2 rs7903146 (all OR &gt; 1, p &lt; 0.01), but not rs12255372. In addition, significant difference was observed in case/control comparison for 112/112 (GG/2R2R/TT) haplotype combination frequency of CAPN10 SNP-43/19/63 (OR = 3.32, p = 0.043). In summary, TCF7L2 rs7903146 and 112/112 haplotype of CAPN10 might be associated with GDM risks.

28357066|t|Association of two synonymous splicing-associated CpG single nucleotide polymorphisms in calpain 10 and solute carrier family 2 member 2 with type 2 diabetes.
28357066|a|Coding synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have attracted little attention until recently. However, such SNPs located in epigenetic, CpG sites modifying exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) can be informative with regards to the recently verified association of intragenic methylation and splicing. The present study describes the association of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with the exonic, synonymous, epigenetic SNPs, rs3749166 in calpain 10 (CAPN10) glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocator and rs5404 in solute carrier family 2, member 2 (SLC2A2), also termed GLUT2, which, according to prior bioinformatic analysis, strongly modify the splicing potential of glucose transport-associated genes. Previous association studies reveal that only rs5404 exhibits a strong negative T2D association, while data on the CAPN10 polymorphism are contradictory. In the present study DNA from blood samples of 99 Greek non-diabetic control subjects and 71 T2D patients was analyzed. In addition, relevant publicly available cases (40) resulting from examination of 110 Personal Genome Project data files were analyzed. The frequency of the rs3749166 A allele, was similar in the patients and non-diabetic control subjects. However, AG heterozygotes were more frequent among patients (73.24% for Greek patients and 54.55% for corresponding non-diabetic control subjects; P=0.0262; total cases, 52.99 and 75.00%, respectively; P=0.0039). The rs5404 T allele was only observed in CT heterozygotes (Greek non-diabetic control subjects, 39.39% and Greek patients, 22.54%; P=0.0205; total cases, 34.69 and 21.28%, respectively; P=0.0258). Notably, only one genotype, heterozygous AG/CC, was T2D-associated (Greek non-diabetic control subjects, 29.29% and Greek patients, 56.33%; P=0.004; total cases, 32.84 and 56.58%, respectively; P=0.0008). Furthermore, AG/CC was strongly associated with very high (&gt;=8.5%) glycosylated plasma hemoglobin levels among patients (P=0.0002 for all cases). These results reveal the complex heterozygotic SNP association with T2D, and indicate possible synergies of these epigenetic, splicing-regulatory, synonymous SNPs, which modify the splicing potential of two alternative glucose transport-associated genes.

28607931|t|Genetic Epidemiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Mexican Mestizos.
28607931|a|There are currently about 415 million people with diabetes worldwide, a figure likely to increase to 642 million by 2040. In 2015, Mexico was the second Latin American country and sixth in the world in prevalence of this disorder with nearly 11.5 million of patients. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the main kind of diabetes and its etiology is complex with environmental and genetic factors involved. Indeed, polymorphisms in several genes have been associated with this disease worldwide. To estimate the genetic epidemiology of T2D in Mexican mestizos a systematic bibliographic search of published articles through PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was conducted. Just case-control studies of candidate genes about T2D in Mexican mestizo inhabitants were included. Nineteen studies that met the inclusion criteria were found. In total, 68 polymorphisms of 41 genes were assessed; 26 of them were associated with T2D risk, which were located in ABCA1, ADRB3, CAPN10, CDC123/CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CRP, ELMO1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, IRS1, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, LTA, NXPH1, SIRT1, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and TNF-alpha genes. Overall, 21 of the 41 analyzed genes were associated with T2D in Mexican mestizos. Such a genetic heterogeneity compares with findings in other ethnic groups.

29151334|t|Investigation of glucocorticoid receptor and calpain-10 gene polymorphisms in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
29151334|a|Background/aim: We proposed to investigate the role of calpain-10 (CAPN10) gene single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-19 and SNP-44 and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) gene N363S polymorphisms in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Materials and methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 125 patients with T2DM and 112 healthy volunteers. Genotyping was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Results: There were no statistically significant differences found between the allele and genotype frequencies of CAPN10 SNP-19, CAPN10 SNP-44, and NR3C1 N363S polymorphisms and T2DM development (P &gt; 0.05). The CAPN10 SNP-19 del-allele, CAPN10 SNP-44 C-allele, and NR3C1 N363S G-allele were determined to be risk factors for T2DM development. In T2DM patients an association was identified between the CAPN10 SNP-19 del-allele, homozygous del/del genotype, SNP-44 C-allele, heterozygous TC genotype, NR3C1 N363S G-allele, heterozygous AG genotype, and increased BMI. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the SNP-44 polymorphism is associated with T2DM susceptibility and contributes to the risk of T2DM.

29506634|t|Association analysis of calpain 10 gene variants/haplotypes with gestational diabetes mellitus among Mexican women.
29506634|a|Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolically complex disease with major genetic determinants. GDM has been associated with insulin resistance and dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells, so the GDM candidate genes are those that encode proteins modulating the function and secretion of insulin, such as that for calpain 10 (CAPN10). This study aimed to assess whether single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-43, SNP-44, SNP-63, and the indel-19 variant, and specific haplotypes of the CAPN10 gene were associated with gestational diabetes mellitus. We studied 116 patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and 83 women with normal glucose tolerance. Measurements of anthropometric and biochemical parameters were performed. SNP-43, SNP-44, and SNP-63 were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphisms, while the indel-19 variant was detected by TaqMan qPCR assays.  The allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of the four variants did not differ significantly between women with gestational diabetes mellitus and controls. However, in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, glucose levels were significantly higher bearing the 3R/3R genotype than in carriers of the 3R/2R genotype of the indel-19 variant (p = 0.006). In conclusion, the 3R/3R genotype of the indel-19 variant of the CAPN-10 gene influenced increased glucose levels in these Mexican women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

30425305|t|Calpain-10 regulates actin dynamics by proteolysis of microtubule-associated protein 1B.
30425305|a|Calpain-10 (CAPN10) is the calpain family protease identified as the first candidate susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the detailed molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Here we report that CAPN10 processes microtubule associated protein 1 (MAP1) family proteins into heavy and light chains and regulates their binding activities to microtubules and actin filaments. Immunofluorescent analysis of Capn10-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts shows that MAP1B, a member of the MAP1 family of proteins, is localized at actin filaments rather than at microtubules. Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching analysis shows that calpain-10 regulates actin dynamics via MAP1B cleavage. Moreover, in pancreatic islets from CAPN10 knockout mice, insulin secretion was significantly increased both at the high and low glucose levels. These findings indicate that deficiency of calpain-10 expression may affect insulin secretion by abnormal actin reorganization, coordination and dynamics through MAP1 family processing.

30728419|t|Blood-based analysis of type-2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility genes identifies specific transcript variants with deregulated expression and association with disease risk.
30728419|a|Despite significant progress by genome-wide association studies, the ability of genetic variants to conduce to the prediction or prognosis of type-2 diabetes (T2D) is weak. Expression analysis of the corresponding genes may suggest possible links between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and T2D phenotype and/or risk. Herein, we investigated the expression patterns of 24 T2D-susceptibility genes, and their individual transcript variants (tv), in peripheral blood of T2D patients and controls (CTs), applying RNA-seq and real-time qPCR methodologies, and explore possible associations with disease features. Our data revealed the deregulation of certain transcripts in T2D patients. Among them, the down-regulation of CAPN10 tv3 was confirmed as an independent predictor for T2D. In patients, increased expression of CDK5 tv2, CDKN2A tv3 or THADA tv5 correlated positively with serum insulin levels, of CDK5 tv1 positively with % HbA1c levels, while in controls, elevated levels of TSPAN8 were associated positively with the presence of T2D family history. Herein, a T2D-specific expression profile of specific transcripts of disease-susceptibility genes is for the first time described in human peripheral blood. Large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the potential of these molecules to serve as disease biomarkers.

31122183|t|The Importance of Precision Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM): From Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacoepigenetic Aspects.
31122183|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide disorder as the most important challenges of health-care systems. Controlling the normal glycaemia greatly profit long-term prognosis and gives explanation for early, effective, constant, and safe intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Finding the main genetic and epigenetic profile of T2DM and the exact molecular targets of T2DM medications can shed a light to its personalized management. The comprehensive information of T2DM was earned through the genome-wide association study (GWAS) studies. In the current review we represent the most important candidate genes of T2DM like CAPN10, TCF7L2, PPAR-gamma, IRSs, KCNJ11, WFS1, and HNF homeoboxes. Different genetic variations of candidate gene can predict the efficacy of T2DM personalized strategy medication. RESULTS: SLCs and AMPK variations are considered for metformin, CYP2C9, KATP channel, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and KCNQ1 for sulphonylureas, OATP1B, and KCNQ1 for repaglinide and the last but not the least ADIPOQ, PPAR-gamma, SLC, CYP2C8, and SLCO1B1 for thiazolidinediones response prediction. CONCLUSION: Taken everything into the consideration, there is an extreme need to determine the genetic status of T2DM patients in some known genetic region before planning the medication strategies.

31292430|t|The Association Between the rs2975760 and rs3792267 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Calpain 10 (CAPN10) and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
31292430|a|BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the association between the rs2975760 and rs3792267 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene and gestational diabetes mellitus. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 138 patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and 152 healthy pregnant women. Venous blood was separated, and the DNA was extracted. The rs2975760 and rs3792267SNP polymorphisms of CAPN10 were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The frequencies of different genotypes in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and healthy pregnant women were determined, and the relationship between different SNP genotypes and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus was analyzed. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the frequencies of the TT, CT and CC genotypes of rs2975760 and the frequencies of the GG, AG and AA genotypes of rs3792267 between the women with gestational diabetes and the controls. Expression of rs2975760 and rs3792267 were not associated with the risk of gestational diabetes in the dominant model, recessive model, and additive model. However, grade B and grade D diabetes in the CC and TC genotypes of rs2975760 were significantly different from those in the TT genotype (P&lt;0.05). Grade B and grade D diabetes in the AA and AG genotypes of rs3792267 were significantly different compared with those in the GG genotype (P&lt;0.05), and allele A was significantly increased compared with allele G (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS The rs2975760 and rs3792267 SNP polymorphisms of CAPN10 showed no significant association with the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus and only a mild association with the severity.

31398423|t|Arsenic impairs GLUT1 trafficking through the inhibition of the calpain system in lymphocytes.
31398423|a|Exposure to arsenic is associated with increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The proteases calpain-1 (CAPN1), calpain-2 (CAPN2) and calpain-10 (CAPN10) and their endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (CAST) regulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipocytes. We investigated whether arsenic disrupts GLUT1 trafficking and function through calpain inhibition, using lymphocytes as a cell model. Lymphocytes from healthy subjects were treated with 0.1 or 1 muM of sodium arsenite for 72 h and challenged with 3.9 or 11.1 mM of glucose. Our results showed that arsenite inhibited GLUT1 trafficking, glucose uptake, and calpain activity in the presence of 11.1 mM of glucose. These correlated with a decrease in the autolytical fragment of 50 kDa of CAPN1 and increased levels of CAST, but there were no changes in CAPN2 and CAPN10. We used a cell-free system to evaluate the effect of arsenite over CAPN1, finding that arsenite induced CAPN1 autolysis. To confirm that calpains are involved in GLUT1 trafficking and glucose uptake in lymphocytes, we generated stable CAPN1 or CAPN10 knockdowns in Jurkat cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). CAPN1 knockdown induced glucose uptake, while CAPN10 knockdown diminished glucose uptake, which correlated with a significant reduction of calpain activity after the pulse with 11.1 mM of glucose. These data showed that CAPN10 was responsible for the induction of calpain activity after the challenge with 11.1 mM of glucose and that CAPN1 and CAPN10 regulate glucose uptake in lymphocytes. Altogether, our results suggest that arsenite impairs GLUT1 trafficking and function through calpain dysregulation.

31791003|t|Calpain Activity in Leukocytes is Associated with Diabetes Biochemical Markers.
31791003|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CAPN10 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Specific members of the calpain system (CAPN1, CAPN2 and CAPN10) are implicated in glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the calpain activity in leukocytes of control subjects and patients with T2D and its association with the calpain family members involved in glucose metabolism and with biochemical parameters that are altered in T2D. METHODS: Calpain activity under extracellular glucose concentrations (70-280 mg/dL) was evaluated in leukocytes from subjects with and without T2D. Protein and mRNA levels of CAPN1, CAPN2 and CAPN10 were evaluated. Calpain inhibitors assays were performed in leukocytes from subjects without T2D to evaluate glucose uptake. Calpain activity at 100 mg/dL glucose was correlated with biochemical parameters by multivariate regression. RESULTS: Calpain activity in control subjects increased with extracellular glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner, showing a negative association with HbA1c levels and total amount of CAPN10 protein. In contrast, calpain activity is decreased in patients with T2D and do not respond to changes in glucose concentration. A reduction of CAPN1 autolytic fragments were observed in the subjects with diabetes. Calpain inhibitors decreased calpain activity but did not altered glucose uptake in leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Calpain activity induced by glucose in leukocytes was associated with biochemical markers of glucose metabolism and with CAPN10 protein abundance. Calpain activity is low in subjects with T2D. Thus, calpain activity induced by extracellular glucose in leukocytes could be a potential marker for T2D early risk detection.
