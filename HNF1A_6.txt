29120028|t|Precision medicine for monogenic diabetes: from a survey to the development of a next-generation diagnostic panel.
29120028|a|Monogenic diabetes (MD) accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases. Because of its wide phenotypic spectrum, MD is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. While clinical and biochemical parameters can suggest MD, a definitive diagnosis requires genetic analysis. We conducted a survey among clinicians specialising in diabetes to document the cases with MD. Of 74 clinically suspected MD patients, 46% had undergone genetic analysis, which was mostly conducted using Sanger's classical sequencing method. The most common recorded mutations were located in the GCK gene, followed by the mitochondrial genome (m.3243A&gt;G mutation) and the HNF1B and HNF1A genes. The remaining 54% of patients only had a clinical diagnosis, mostly because genetic analysis was not easily accessible. Here, we designed a new diagnostic panel of 42 genes that was developed based on the survey. The panel was validated with an independent sample of nine known MD patients. Our survey confirms the need for a comprehensive analytical instrument for the diagnosis of MD, which will be met by the proposed panel. The diagnosis of MD is crucial because it dictates treatment and may improve metabolic control and reduce long-term complications as proposed by precision medicine.

29175806|t|The Distribution of Different Types of Diabetes in Childhood: A Single Center Experience
29175806|a|OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common cause of diabetes in childhood but type 2 diabetes (T2D) and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are emerging as noteworthy causes of diabetes at young ages. The aim is to determine the distribution, trends and clinical features of the different types of diabetes in childhood in one tertiary center. METHODS: The records of children and adolescents aged 0-18 years who were diagnosed as "diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia" between January 1999 and December 2016, were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at diagnosis and type of diabetes were recorded. RESULTS: The mean +- standard deviation age of 835 patients (48.7% females) at diagnosis was 8.8+-4.4 years. Eighty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed as T1D, 5.7% as T2D, 5.3% as clinical MODY and 5% as being cases of other types of diabetes. The frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe DKA in T1D were 48.4% and 11.6%, respectively. Fourteen patients (29.2%) with T2D presented with ketosis and two of them (4.2%) had DKA at diagnosis. Antibody positivity was 83.1% in T1D and 14.8% in T2D. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of T2D has clearly been demonstrated in recent years with a frequency of 1.9%, 2.4% and 7.9% in 1999-2004, 2005-2010 and 2011-2016, respectively (p&lt;0.001). In MODY, genetic analysis was performed in 26 (59%) patients and HNF1A and GCK gene mutations were detected in 3 (11.5%) and 14 (53.8%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the most frequent cause of DM is T1D in childhood, a trend towards increase in the frequency of T2D in recent years is notable in our population.

29185012|t|Systems biology of the IMIDIA biobank from organ donors and pancreatectomised patients defines a novel transcriptomic signature of islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes.
29185012|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pancreatic islet beta cell failure causes type 2 diabetes in humans. To identify transcriptomic changes in type 2 diabetic islets, the Innovative Medicines Initiative for Diabetes: Improving beta-cell function and identification of diagnostic biomarkers for treatment monitoring in Diabetes (IMIDIA) consortium ( www.imidia.org ) established a comprehensive, unique multicentre biobank of human islets and pancreas tissues from organ donors and metabolically phenotyped pancreatectomised patients (PPP). METHODS: Affymetrix microarrays were used to assess the islet transcriptome of islets isolated either by enzymatic digestion from 103 organ donors (OD), including 84 non-diabetic and 19 type 2 diabetic individuals, or by laser capture microdissection (LCM) from surgical specimens of 103 PPP, including 32 non-diabetic, 36 with type 2 diabetes, 15 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 20 with recent-onset diabetes (&lt;1 year), conceivably secondary to the pancreatic disorder leading to surgery (type 3c diabetes). Bioinformatics tools were used to (1) compare the islet transcriptome of type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic OD and PPP as well as vs IGT and type 3c diabetes within the PPP group; and (2) identify transcription factors driving gene co-expression modules correlated with insulin secretion ex vivo and glucose tolerance in vivo. Selected genes of interest were validated for their expression and function in beta cells. RESULTS: Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified 19 genes differentially expressed (false discovery rate &lt;=0.05, fold change &gt;=1.5) in type 2 diabetic vs non-diabetic islets from OD and PPP. Nine out of these 19 dysregulated genes were not previously reported to be dysregulated in type 2 diabetic islets. Signature genes included TMEM37, which inhibited Ca2+-influx and insulin secretion in beta cells, and ARG2 and PPP1R1A, which promoted insulin secretion. Systems biology approaches identified HNF1A, PDX1 and REST as drivers of gene co-expression modules correlated with impaired insulin secretion or glucose tolerance, and 14 out of 19 differentially expressed type 2 diabetic islet signature genes were enriched in these modules. None of these signature genes was significantly dysregulated in islets of PPP with impaired glucose tolerance or type 3c diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These studies enabled the stringent definition of a novel transcriptomic signature of type 2 diabetic islets, regardless of islet source and isolation procedure. Lack of this signature in islets from PPP with IGT or type 3c diabetes indicates differences possibly due to peculiarities of these hyperglycaemic conditions and/or a role for duration and severity of hyperglycaemia. Alternatively, these transcriptomic changes capture, but may not precede, beta cell failure.

29207974|t|Spectrum of mutations in monogenic diabetes genes identified from high-throughput DNA sequencing of 6888 individuals.
29207974|a|BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of monogenic as well as atypical forms of diabetes mellitus has important clinical implications for their specific diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted treatment. Single gene mutations that affect beta-cell function represent 1-2% of all cases of diabetes. However, phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of family history of diabetes can limit the diagnosis of monogenic forms of diabetes. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an excellent opportunity to screen large numbers of individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes for mutations in disease-associated genes. METHODS: We utilized a targeted sequencing approach using the Illumina HiSeq to perform a case-control sequencing study of 22 monogenic diabetes genes in 4016 individuals with type 2 diabetes (including 1346 individuals diagnosed before the age of 40 years) and 2872 controls. We analyzed protein-coding variants identified from the sequence data and compared the frequencies of pathogenic variants (protein-truncating variants and missense variants) between the cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 40 individuals with diabetes (1.8% of early onset sub-group and 0.6% of adult onset sub-group) were carriers of known pathogenic missense variants in the GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, ABCC8, and INS genes. In addition, heterozygous protein truncating mutations were detected in the GCK, HNF1A, and HNF1B genes in seven individuals with diabetes. Rare missense mutations in the GCK gene were significantly over-represented in individuals with diabetes (0.5% carrier frequency) compared to controls (0.035%). One individual with early onset diabetes was homozygous for a rare pathogenic missense variant in the WFS1 gene but did not have the additional phenotypes associated with Wolfram syndrome. CONCLUSION: Targeted sequencing of genes linked with monogenic diabetes can identify disease-relevant mutations in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes not suspected of having monogenic forms of the disease. Our data suggests that GCK-MODY frequently masquerades as classical type 2 diabetes. The results confirm that MODY is under-diagnosed, particularly in individuals presenting with early onset diabetes and clinically labeled as type 2 diabetes; thus, sequencing of all monogenic diabetes genes should be routinely considered in such individuals. Genetic information can provide a specific diagnosis, inform disease prognosis and may help to better stratify treatment plans.

29222740|t|A Case of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY3) in a Family with a Novel HNF1A Gene Mutation in Five Generations.
29222740|a|Diabetes mellitus with autosomal dominant inheritance, i.e., maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), is a genetic form of diabetes mellitus. The MODY phenotype is associated with gene mutations leading to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Here, we present the clinical case of a 50-year-old proband with familial diabetes mellitus in five generations (proband, her mother, grandmother, great-grandfather, and son). This disease is most likely associated with the novel Ser6Arg mutation in the HNF1A gene, which was identified in four family members. The mutation was not detected in MODY patients (126 subjects), in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (188 subjects), and in a general population sample (564 subjects).

29264522|t|High Prevalence of Diabetes-Predisposing Variants in MODY Genes Among Danish Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
29264522|a|Context: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with first recognition during pregnancy, is a heterogeneous form of diabetes characterized by various degrees of beta-cell dysfunction. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of possibly pathogenic variants in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and INS among women with GDM. Furthermore, we examined the glucose tolerance status in variant carriers vs noncarriers at follow-up. Design Setting and Patients: We sequenced the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and INS using targeted region capture and next-generation sequencing in 354 Danish women with diet-treated GDM. Glucose tolerance was examined at follow-up 10 years after the index pregnancy. Main Outcome Measures: The prevalence of possibly pathogenic variants in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and INS was estimated, and differences in anthropometric traits, high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and glucose metabolism were measured. Results: At baseline, 17 possibly disease-causing variants were found in 21 women, revealing a combined GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and INS variant prevalence of 5.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.5% to 8.4%). At follow-up, 15 out of 135 women with diabetes (11%) were carriers of variants in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, or INS. Conclusions: Almost 6% of Danish women with diet-treated GDM have possibly pathogenic variants in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, or INS. These women are at high risk of developing diabetes after pregnancy. Thus screening for variants in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, and INS should be considered among women with GDM.

29371776|t|Mutations in HNF1A Gene are not a Common Cause of Familial Young-Onset Diabetes in Iran.
29371776|a|Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) as a homeodomain transcription factor which regulates variety of genes, are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Detection of HNF1A mutations not only classifies the subtype, but also predicts the likely clinical course and may alters the method of treatment from insulin to the oral sulphonylureas, which is shown to improve glycemic control. The coding and promoter regions of HNF1A gene were screened for mutations in 34 unrelated Iranian MODY patients. We identified one novel missense mutation (C49G) and two novel polymorphisms and 8 recently identified SNPs in the HNF1A gene. It is possible that in Iran, other yet to be identified genes are responsible for the familial young onset diabetes. Hence, there is a need for more extensive genetic analyses in Iranian patients with familial young onset diabetes.

29424957|t|HNF1A variant, energy-reduced diets and insulin resistance improvement during weight loss: The POUNDS Lost trial and DIRECT.
29424957|a|AIM: To determine whether weight-loss diets varying in macronutrients modulate the genetic effect of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) rs7957197 on weight loss and improvement of insulin resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed the interaction between HNF1A rs7957197 and weight-loss diets with regard to weight loss and insulin resistance improvement among 722 overweight/obese adults from a 2-year randomized weight-loss trial, the POUNDS Lost trial. The findings were replicated in another independent 2-year weight-loss trial, the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT), in 280 overweight/obese adults. RESULTS: In the POUNDS Lost trial, we found that a high-fat diet significantly modified the genetic effect of HNF1A on weight loss and reduction in waist circumference (P for interaction = .006 and .005, respectively). Borderline significant interactions for fasting insulin and insulin resistance (P for interaction = .07 and .06, respectively) were observed. We replicated the results in DIRECT. Pooled results showed similar significant interactions with weight loss, waist circumference reduction, and improvement in fasting insulin and insulin resistance (P values for interaction = .001, .005, .02 and .03, respectively). Greater decreases in weight, waist circumference, fasting insulin level and insulin resistance were observed in participants with the T allele compared to those without the T allele in the high-fat diet group (P = .04, .03 and .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our replicable findings provide strong evidence that individuals with the HNF1A rs7957197 T allele might obtain more benefits in weight loss and improvement of insulin resistance by choosing a hypocaloric and high-fat diet.

29439679|t|Comprehensive genomic analysis identifies pathogenic variants in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) patients in South India.
29439679|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an early-onset, autosomal dominant form of non-insulin dependent diabetes. Genetic diagnosis of MODY can transform patient management. Earlier data on the genetic predisposition to MODY have come primarily from familial studies in populations of European origin. METHODS: In this study, we carried out a comprehensive genomic analysis of 289 individuals from India that included 152 clinically diagnosed MODY cases to identify variants in known MODY genes. Further, we have analyzed exome data to identify putative MODY relevant variants in genes previously not implicated in MODY. Functional validation of MODY relevant variants was also performed. RESULTS: We found MODY 3 (HNF1A; 7.2%) to be most frequently mutated followed by MODY 12 (ABCC8; 3.3%). They together account for ~ 11% of the cases. In addition to known MODY genes, we report the identification of variants in RFX6, WFS1, AKT2, NKX6-1 that may contribute to development of MODY. Functional assessment of the NKX6-1 variants showed that they are functionally impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed HNF1A and ABCC8 to be the most frequently mutated MODY genes in south India. Further we provide evidence for additional MODY relevant genes, such as NKX6-1, and these require further validation.

29450745|t|Clinical Management of Women with Monogenic Diabetes During Pregnancy.
29450745|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monogenic diabetes accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases, but is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes. Accurate genetic diagnosis directs management, such as no pharmacologic treatment for GCK-MODY, low-dose sulfonylureas for HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY, and high-dose sulfonylureas for KATP channel-related diabetes. While diabetes treatment is defined for the most common causes of monogenic diabetes, pregnancy poses a challenge to management. Here, we discuss the key issues in pregnancy affected by monogenic diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: General recommendations for pregnancy affected by GCK-MODY determine need for maternal insulin treatment based on fetal mutation status. However, a recent study suggests macrosomia and miscarriage rates may be increased with this strategy. Recent demonstration of transplacental transfer of sulfonylureas also raises questions as to when insulin should be initiated in sulfonylurea-responsive forms of monogenic diabetes. Pregnancy represents a challenge in management of monogenic diabetes, where factors of maternal glycemic control, fetal mutation status, and transplacental transfer of medication must all be taken into consideration. Guidelines for pregnancy affected by monogenic diabetes will benefit from large, prospective studies to better define the need for and timing of initiation of insulin treatment.

29486427|t|Pharmacogenetics and target identification in diabetes.
29486427|a|In diabetes, pharmacogenetics can be used both to identify patient subgroups who will have most benefit and/or least harm from a particularly treatment, and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug action and disease aetiology. There is increasing evidence that genetic variation alters response to diabetes treatments-both in terms of glycaemic response and side effects. This can be seen with dramatic impact on clinical care, in patients with genetic forms of diabetes such as Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young caused by HNF1A mutations, and Neonatal diabetes due to activating mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11. Beyond monogenic diabetes, pharmacogenetic variants have yet to impact on clinical practice, yet the effect sizes (e.g. for metformin intolerance and OCT1 variants; or for metformin action and SLC2A2 variants) are potentially of clinical utility, especially if the genotype is already known at the point of prescribing. Over the next few years, increasing cohort sizes and linkage at scale to electronic medical records will provide considerable potential for stratification and novel target identification in diabetes.

29493090|t|Clinical heterogeneity of hyperinsulinism due to HNF1A and HNF4A mutations.
29493090|a|BACKGROUND: Dominant inactivating mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A have been described to cause hyperinsulinism (HI) before evolving to diabetes. However, information available in the literature regarding the clinical phenotype is limited. OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence of HNF1A and HNF4A mutations in a large cohort of children with HI, and to describe their genotypes and phenotypes. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed to extract clinical information. Mutation analysis was carried out for 8 genes associated with HI (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, HNF4A, HNF1A, and UCP2). RESULTS: HNF1A and HNF4A mutations were identified in 5.9% (12 out of 204; HNF1A = 7, HNF4A = 5) of diazoxide-responsive HI probands. The clinical phenotypes were extremely variable. Two children showed evidence of ketone production during hypoglycemia, a biochemical profile atypical for hyperinsulinism. At the time of analysis, diazoxide was discontinued in 5 children at a median age of 6.8 years. None had developed diabetes mellitus at a median age of 7.0 years. CONCLUSIONS: Given the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of HNF1A- and HNF4A-HI, all children with transient, diazoxide-responsive HI without clear history of perinatal stress, should be screened for HNF1A and HNF4A mutations as it predicts the clinical course and affects the subsequent management plan.

29633446|t|A novel INS mutation in a family with maturity-onset diabetes of the young: Variable insulin secretion and putative mechanisms.
29633446|a|Insulin gene (INS) mutations cause a rare form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant diabetes with at least 14 confirmed causative genes. Here, we describe a family with MODY due to a novel INS mutation, detected using massively parallel sequencing (MPS). The proband presented aged 11 years with mild diabetic ketoacidosis. She was negative for IA2 and GAD antibodies. She had a strong family history of diabetes affecting both her two siblings and her mother, none of whom had ketosis but who were considered to have type 1 diabetes and managed on insulin, and her maternal grandfather, who was managed for decades on sulfonylureas. Of note, her younger sister had insulin deficiency but an elevated fasting proinsulin:insulin ratio of 76% (ref 5%-30%). Sanger sequencing of HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B in the proband was negative. Targeted MPS using a custom-designed amplicon panel sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq detected a heterozygous INS mutation c.277G&gt;A (p.Glu93Lys). Sanger sequencing confirmed the variant segregated with diabetes within the family. Structural analysis of this variant suggested disruption of a critical hydrogen bond between insulin and the insulin receptor; however, the clinical picture in some individuals also suggested abnormal insulin processing and insulin deficiency. This family has a novel INS mutation and demonstrated variable insulin deficiency. MPS represents an efficient method of MODY diagnosis in families with rarer gene mutations.

29666556|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A variants in Croatia.
29666556|a|Introduction: Maturity onset diabetes of the young due to HNF1A mutations (HNF1A-MODY) is the most frequent form of monogenic diabetes in adults. It is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but establishing genetic diagnosis is important, as treatment differs from the common types of diabetes. HNF1A-MODY has not been investigated in Croatia before due to limited access to genetic testing. In this study we aimed to describe the characteristics of young adults diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 45 years, who have rare HNF1A allele variants, and estimate the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY in Croatia. Materials and methods: We recruited 477 C-peptide positive and beta cell antibody negative subjects through the Croatian Diabetes Registry. HNF1A was sequenced for all participants and systematic assessment of the variants found was performed. The prevalence of HNF1A-MODY was calculated in the study group and results extrapolated to estimate the proportion of diabetic individuals with HNF1A-MODY in Croatia and the population prevalence. Results: Our study identified 13 individuals harbouring rare HNF1A allelic variants. After systematic assessment, 8 were assigned a diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY. Two individuals were able to discontinue insulin treatment following the diagnosis. We estimated that HNF1A-MODY in Croatia has a prevalence of 66 (95% CI 61 - 72) cases per million. Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of HNF1A-MODY in Croatia is similar to that reported in other European countries. Finding cases lead to important treatment changes for patients. This strongly supports the introduction of diagnostic genetic testing for monogenic diabetes in Croatia.

29739729|t|Congenital Hyperinsulinism and Evolution to Sulfonylurearesponsive Diabetes Later in Life due to a Novel Homozygous p.L171F ABCC8 Mutation
29739729|a|Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children. Recessive inactivating mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes account for approximately 50% of all CHI cases. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy and diabetes in later life have been reported in patients with HNF1A, HNF4A and ABCC8 mutations. Herein, we present a child who was diagnosed with CHI at birth, then developed diabetes mellitus at the age of nine years due to a novel homozygous missense, p.L171F (c.511C&gt;T) mutation in exon 4 of ABCC8. The parents and one sibling were heterozygous carriers, whilst a younger sibling who had transient neonatal hypoglycemia was homozygous for the mutation. The mother and (maternal) uncle, who was also heterozygous for the mutation, developed diabetes within their third decade of life. The preliminary results of sulphonylurea (SU) treatment was suggestive of SU responsiveness. Patients with homozygous ABCC8 mutations can present with CHI in the newborn period, the hyperinsulinism can show variability in terms of clinical severity and age at presentation and can cause diabetes later in life. Patients with homozygous ABCC8 mutations who are managed medically should be followed long-term as they may be at increased risk of developing diabetes after many years.

29758564|t|Monogenic diabetes in overweight and obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes: the TODAY clinical trial.
29758564|a|PurposeMonogenic diabetes accounts for 1-2% of diabetes cases. It is often undiagnosed, which may lead to inappropriate treatment. This study was performed to estimate the prevalence of monogenic diabetes in a cohort of overweight/obese adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D).MethodsSequencing using a custom monogenic diabetes gene panel was performed on a racially/ethnically diverse cohort of 488 overweight/obese adolescents with T2D in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) clinical trial. Associations between having a monogenic diabetes variant and clinical characteristics and time to treatment failure were analyzed.ResultsMore than 4% (22/488) had genetic variants causing monogenic diabetes (seven GCK, seven HNF4A, five HNF1A, two INS, and one KLF11). Patients with monogenic diabetes had a statistically, but not clinically, significant lower body mass index (BMI) z-score, lower fasting insulin, and higher fasting glucose. Most (6/7) patients with HNF4A variants rapidly failed TODAY treatment across study arms (hazard ratio = 5.03, P = 0.0002), while none with GCK variants failed treatment.ConclusionThe finding of 4.5% of patients with monogenic diabetes in an overweight/obese cohort of children and adolescents with T2D suggests that monogenic diabetes diagnosis should be considered in children and adolescents without diabetes-associated autoantibodies and maintained C-peptide, regardless of BMI, as it may direct appropriate clinical management.

29791172|t|[Current treatment options in Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young].
29791172|a|The discovery of MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young) and the elucidation of its heritability enabled more precise clinical characteristics of different MODY subtypes and led to understanding that glucokinase MODY (GCK-MODY) is not associated with vascular complications in long term follow-up, whereas MODY of transcription factors (e.g. HNF1A-MODY) is in case of bad metabolic control connected with the acceleration of particularly microvascular complications. There is a strong evidence of the needlessness of any specific antidiabetic treatment in prognosticaly favourable GCK-MODY (except for the pregnancy). On the contrary, in MODY of transcription factors, including the most common one - HNF1A-MODY, the treatment, traditionally based on sulphonylurea derivatives (and after their failure on insulin) is required. Due to wider spectrum of available antidiabetic agents offering individualization of the treatment, the question of efficacy of other antidiabetic agents in MODY patients arises. This review article summarizes current knowledge of therapeutic options in patients with MODY.Key words: insulin - MODY - oral hypoglycemic drugs - treatment.

29844095|t|Mexican Carriers of the HNF1A p.E508K Variant Do Not Experience an Enhanced Response to Sulfonylureas.
29844095|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess whether an ethnic-specific variant (p.E508K) in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) gene hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1A) found in Mexicans is associated with higher sensitivity to sulfonylureas, as documented in patients with MODY3. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 96 participants (46 variant carriers and 50 age- and sex-matched noncarriers). Response to glipizide (one 2.5-5.0-mg dose), metformin (four 500-mg doses), and an oral glucose challenge was evaluated using a previously validated protocol. Glucose and insulin levels and their areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Carriers of the p.E508K variant had a lower maximum insulin peak during the glipizide challenge as compared with noncarriers with diabetes (P &lt; 0.05). Also, carriers had a lower insulin response after the oral glucose challenge. Following an oral glucose tolerance test in the presence of metformin, carriers of the p.E508K variant with diabetes had a lower maximum insulin peak and total and incremental insulin AUC value as compared with noncarriers with diabetes (P &lt; 0.05). A similar but nonsignificant trend was seen in participants without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of variant p.E508K in HNF1A have a reduced insulin response rather than the increased sensitivity to sulfonylureas seen in patients with MODY3.

29895593|t|The Common HNF1A Variant I27L Is a Modifier of Age at Diabetes Diagnosis in Individuals With HNF1A-MODY.
29895593|a|There is wide variation in the age at diagnosis of diabetes in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to a mutation in the HNF1A gene. We hypothesized that common variants at the HNF1A locus (rs1169288 [I27L], rs1800574 [A98V]), which are associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility, may modify age at diabetes diagnosis in individuals with HNF1A-MODY. Meta-analysis of two independent cohorts, comprising 781 individuals with HNF1A-MODY, found no significant associations between genotype and age at diagnosis. However after stratifying according to type of mutation (protein-truncating variant [PTV] or missense), we found each 27L allele to be associated with a 1.6-year decrease (95% CI -2.6, -0.7) in age at diagnosis, specifically in the subset (n = 444) of individuals with a PTV. The effect size was similar and significant across the two independent cohorts of individuals with HNF1A-MODY. We report a robust genetic modifier of HNF1A-MODY age at diagnosis that further illustrates the strong effect of genetic variation within HNF1A upon diabetes phenotype.

29916222|t|Exploring the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis of MODY3
29916222|a|Background/aim: MODY3 associated with HNF1A is the most common form of MODY and is clinically misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes due to similar clinical symptoms. This study aimed to analyze the role of HNF1A-regulated miRNAs as a biomarker in the diagnosis of MODY3. Materials and methods: MIN6 cells were transfected with the HNF1A cDNA expression vector for overexpression or with siRNA specific to HNF1A to silence its expression. The HNF1A-regulated miRNAs were determined by RNA-Seq of the total RNA extract. Expressions of the candidate miRNAs in blood samples of MODY3, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes patients and in healthy subjects were compared statistically by Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: This study revealed the presence of 238 known HNF1A-regulated miRNAs in MIN6 cells. miR-129-1-3p, miR-200b-3p, and miR-378a-5p were selected as candidate miRNAs. The expression level of miR-378a-5p significantly decreased in type 2 diabetes and MODY3 patients, while miR-200b-3p expression was significantly decreased only in MODY3 patients. Conclusion: Although further studies with larger numbers of patients are required, this study demonstrated that the expression levels of miR-200b-3p and miR-378a-5p decrease in MODY3 patients and suggests that miR-200b-3p is an especially strong candidate to use clinically for selecting suspected MODY3 patients.

29927023|t|Genetic basis of early-onset, maturity-onset diabetes of the young-like diabetes in Japan and features of patients without mutations in the major MODY genes: Dominance of maternal inheritance.
29927023|a|BACKGROUND: Causative mutations cannot be identified in the majority of Asian patients with suspected maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the genetic basis of Japanese patients with MODY-like diabetes and gain insight into the etiology of patients without mutations in the major MODY genes. SUBJECTS: A total of 263 Japanese patients with early-onset, non-obese, MODY-like diabetes mellitus referred to Osaka City General Hospital for diagnosis. METHODS: Mutational analysis of the four major MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B) by Sanger sequencing. Mutation-positive and mutation-negative patients were further analyzed for clinical features. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 103 (39.2%) patients; 57 mutations in GCK; 29, HNF1A; 7, HNF4A; and 10, HNF1B. Contrary to conventional diagnostic criteria, 18.4% of mutation-positive patients did not have affected parents and 8.2% were in the overweight range (body mass index [BMI] &gt;85th percentile). HOMA-IR at diagnosis was elevated (&gt;2) in 15 of 66 (22.7%) mutation-positive patients. Compared with mutation-positive patients, mutation-negative patients were significantly older (P = 0.003), and had higher BMI percentile at diagnosis (P = 0.0006). Interestingly, maternal inheritance of diabetes was significantly more common in mutation-negative patients (P = 0.0332) and these patients had significantly higher BMI percentile as compared with mutation-negative patients with paternal inheritance (P = 0.0106). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the conventional diagnostic criteria, de novo diabetes, overweight, and insulin-resistance are common in Japanese patients with mutation-positive MODY. A significant fraction of mutation-negative patients had features of early-onset type 2 diabetes common in Japanese, and non-Mendelian inheritance needs to be considered for these patients.

29947923|t|Genetic variants of gestational diabetes mellitus: a study of 112 SNPs among 8722 women in two independent populations.
29947923|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy that has substantial short- and long-term adverse health implications for women and their children. However, large-scale studies on genetic risk loci for GDM remain sparse. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among 2636 women with GDM and 6086 non-GDM control women from the Nurses' Health Study II and the Danish National Birth Cohort. A total of 112 susceptibility genetic variants confirmed by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes were selected and measured. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was created based on variants that were significantly associated with risk of GDM after correcting for the false discovery rate. RESULTS: For the first time, we identified eight variants associated with GDM, namely rs7957197 (HNF1A), rs10814916 (GLIS3), rs3802177 (SLC30A8), rs9379084 (RREB1), rs34872471 (TCF7L2), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs11787792 (GPSM1) and rs7041847 (GLIS3). In addition, we confirmed three variants, rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153 (MTNR1B) and rs4506565 (TCF7L2), that had previously been significantly associated with GDM risk. Furthermore, compared with participants in the first (lowest) quartile of weighted GRS based on these 11 SNPs, the ORs for GDM were 1.07 (95% CI 0.93, 1.22), 1.23 (95% CI 1.07, 1.41) and 1.53 (95% CI 1.34, 1.74) for participants in the second, third and fourth (highest) quartiles, respectively. The significant positive associations between the weighted GRS and risk of GDM persisted across most of the strata of major risk factors for GDM, including family history of type 2 diabetes, smoking status, BMI and age. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this large-scale case-control study with women from two independent populations, eight novel GDM SNPs were identified. These findings offer the potential to improve our understanding of the aetiology of GDM, and particularly of biological mechanisms related to beta cell function.

30050001|t|High-Throughput Approaches onto Uncover (Epi)Genomic Architecture of Type 2 Diabetes.
30050001|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disorder that is caused by a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. High-throughput approaches have opened a new avenue toward a better understanding of the molecular bases of T2D. A genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified a group of the most common susceptibility genes for T2D (i.e., TCF7L2, PPARG, KCNJ1, HNF1A, PTPN1, and CDKAL1) and illuminated novel disease-causing pathways. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based techniques have shed light on rare-coding genetic variants that account for an appreciable fraction of T2D heritability (KCNQ1 and ADRA2A) and population risk of T2D (SLC16A11, TPCN2, PAM, and CCND2). Moreover, single-cell sequencing of human pancreatic islets identified gene signatures that are exclusive to alpha-cells (GCG, IRX2, and IGFBP2) and beta-cells (INS, ADCYAP1, INS-IGF2, and MAFA). Ongoing epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have progressively defined links between epigenetic markers and the transcriptional activity of T2D target genes. Differentially methylated regions were found in TCF7L2, THADA, KCNQ1, TXNIP, SOCS3, SREBF1, and KLF14 loci that are related to T2D. Additionally, chromatin state maps in pancreatic islets were provided and several non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) that are key to T2D pathogenesis were identified (i.e., miR-375). The present review summarizes major progress that has been made in mapping the (epi)genomic landscape of T2D within the last few years.

30068891|t|Heterogeneous nature of diabetes in a family with a gain-of-function mutation in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8) gene.
30068891|a|Gain-of-function ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8) mutations are known to cause neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes in the young. However, the intrafamilial heterogeneous nature of diabetes caused by the ABCC8 mutation is not fully understood to date. To clarify the intrafamilial heterogeneous nature of monogenetic diabetes, we conducted a case study on a family with ABCC8 mutations. We investigated eight family members, including a neonatal diabetes patient, based on metabolic features and genetic analysis. All coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A genes were amplified from genomic DNA and directly sequenced. Five gene mutation carriers with ABCC8 (c.1819G&gt;A/p.V607M) were identified in this family, and the onset and severity of diabetes progressively worsened across the three generations. Each of the ABCC8 gene mutation carrier family members were diagnosed with diabetes as follows: the grandfather with type 2 diabetes at 35 years of age, the aunt with slowly-progressive insulin-dependent diabetes at 18 years of age, the mother with ketosis-onset insulin-dependent diabetes at 14 years of age, the sister with impaired glucose tolerance at 9 years of age, and the proband with transient neonatal diabetes at birth. The present study shows the heterogeneous nature of diabetes in a family with a gain-of-function mutation in the ABCC8 gene.

30086875|t|Genetic causes and treatment of neonatal diabetes and early childhood diabetes.
30086875|a|Diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose associated with single gene mutations are less rare than previously thought and may account for more than 6% of patients attending a pediatric diabetes clinic. The number of loci involved in monogenic diabetes exceed 25, and appropriate genetic diagnosis is crucial to direct therapy, for genetic counseling and for prognosis of short- and long-term complications. Among patients with neonatal diabetes (i.e. with onset within first 6 months of life) and patients with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY; an autosomal dominant form of diabetes), those carrying mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8, HNF1A and HNF4A genes usually respond to oral therapy with sulphonylurea, while those bearing GCK mutations do not necessitate any treatment. Sensor-augmented continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has been successfully employed in neonatal diabetes, and long-lasting effectiveness of sulfonylurea in KCNJ11 mutation carriers with neonatal diabetes well documented.

30143652|t|The E3 SUMO ligase PIASgamma is a novel interaction partner regulating the activity of diabetes associated hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha.
30143652|a|The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1A) is involved in normal pancreas development and function. Rare variants in the HNF1A gene can cause monogenic diabetes, while common variants confer type 2 diabetes risk. The precise mechanisms for regulation of HNF-1A, including the role and function of post-translational modifications, are still largely unknown. Here, we present the first evidence for HNF-1A being a substrate of SUMOylation in cellulo and identify two lysine (K) residues (K205 and K273) as SUMOylation sites. Overexpression of protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIASgamma) represses the transcriptional activity of HNF-1A and is dependent on simultaneous HNF-1A SUMOylation at K205 and K273. Moreover, PIASgamma is a novel HNF-1A interaction partner whose expression leads to translocation of HNF-1A to the nuclear periphery. Thus, our findings support that the E3 SUMO ligase PIASgamma regulates HNF-1A SUMOylation with functional implications, representing new targets for drug development and precision medicine in diabetes.

30155490|t|Lower Circulating miR-122 Level in Patients with HNF1A Variant-Induced Diabetes Compared with Type 2 Diabetes.
30155490|a|miR-122, the expression of which is regulated by several transcription factors, such as HNF1A, was recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma. HNF1A variants can cause diabetes and might be involved in the development of primary liver neoplasm. Differences in miR-122 expression among different types of diabetes have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate differences in serum miR-122 levels in Chinese patients with different forms of diabetes, including T2DM, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), HNF1A variant-induced diabetes (HNF1A-DM), glucokinase variant-induced diabetes (GCK-DM), and mitochondrial A3243G mutation-induced diabetes (MDM). In total, 12 HNF1A-DM patients, 24 gender-, age-, and body mass index-matched (1 : 2) T2DM patients and 24 healthy subjects were included in this study. In addition, 30 monogenic diabetes (11 GCK-DM and 19 MDM) and 17 T1DM patients were included. Fasted blood biochemistry and miR-122 were measured. The results showed that the HNF1A-DM patients had lower miR-122 levels [0.046 (0.023, 0.121)] than T2DM patients [0.165 (0.036, 0.939), P = 0.02] and healthy controls [0.249 (0.049, 1.234), P = 0.019]. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for miR-122 to discriminate HNF1A-DM and T2DM was 0.687 (95% CI: 0.52-0.86, P = 0.07). There was no difference in serum miR-122 among HNF1A-DM, GCK-DM, MDM, and T1DM patients. Lower serum miR-122 is a unique feature of HNF1A-DM patients and might partially explain the increased risk for liver neoplasm and abnormal lipid metabolism in HNF1A-DM patients.

30181854|t|Traditional clinical criteria outperform high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for the screening of hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha maturity-onset diabetes of the young among young Asians with diabetes.
30181854|a|Background: Young adults with diabetes in Asia represent a heterogeneous group. Using traditional clinical criteria to preselect individuals for testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) may exclude a large proportion from testing. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has shown promise as a biomarker to differentiate hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A)-MODY from type 2 diabetes. We aimed to compare the use of hs-CRP as a biomarker versus traditional criteria, to guide testing for HNF1A-MODY among a cohort of young adults with diabetes in Singapore. Methods: A total of 252 adults (age of onset &lt;=45 years) and 20 children with diabetes were recruited. Using traditional criteria (family history of diabetes and onset of diabetes &lt;=25 years) and an hs-CRP cut off of &lt;=0.5 mg/l, 125 and 37 adults, respectively, were identified for HNF1A gene testing. All children underwent HNF1A gene testing. Results: Five adults (5/143, 3.5%) with HNF1A-MODY were identified. There were no HNF1A gene mutations among the children. Traditional criteria correctly identified all five HNF1A-MODY individuals (5/125, 4%), while applying an hs-CRP level of &lt;=0.5 mg/l selected just 1 of these 5 for HNF1A gene testing (1/37, 2.7%). None of those with a positive GAD antibody or undetectable C-peptide level had HNF1A-MODY. Conclusion: The use of hs-CRP to guide screening for HNF1A-MODY among Asian young adults with diabetes did not improve the diagnostic yield. Applying a combination of age of onset of diabetes under 25 years and a family history of diabetes alone could guide targeted HNF1A-MODY screening in Asians, with an expected yield of 4% diagnosed with HNF1A-MODY among those screened.

30229274|t|A UK nationwide prospective study of treatment change in MODY: genetic subtype and clinical characteristics predict optimal glycaemic control after discontinuing insulin and metformin.
30229274|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Treatment change following a genetic diagnosis of MODY is frequently indicated, but little is known about the factors predicting future treatment success. We therefore conducted the first prospective study to determine the impact of a genetic diagnosis on individuals with GCK-, HNF1A- or HNF4A-MODY in the UK, and to identify clinical characteristics predicting treatment success (i.e. HbA1c &lt;=58 mmol/mol [&lt;=7.5%]) with the recommended treatment at 2 years. METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, non-selective study of individuals referred to the Exeter Molecular Genetic Laboratory for genetic testing from December 2010 to December 2012. Individuals from the UK with GCK- or HNF1A/HNF4A-MODY who were not on recommended treatment at the time of genetic diagnosis, and who were diagnosed below the age of 30 years and were currently aged less than 50 years, were eligible to participate. RESULTS: A total of 44 of 58 individuals (75.9%) changed treatment following their genetic diagnosis. Eight individuals diagnosed with GCK-MODY stopped all diabetes medication without experiencing any change in HbA1c (49.5 mmol/mol [6.6%] both before the genetic diagnosis and at a median of 1.25 years' follow-up without treatment, p = 0.88). A total of 36 of 49 individuals (73.5%) diagnosed with HNF1A/HNF4A-MODY changed treatment; however, of the 21 of these individuals who were being managed with diet or sulfonylurea alone at 2 years, only 13 (36.1% of the population that changed treatment) had an HbA1c &lt;=58 mmol/mol (&lt;=7.5%). These individuals had a shorter diabetes duration (median 4.6 vs 18.1 years), lower HbA1c (58 vs 73 mmol/mol [7.5% vs 8.8%]) and lower BMI (median 24.2 vs 26.0 kg/m2) at the time of genetic diagnosis, compared with individuals (n = 23/36) with an HbA1c &gt;58 mmol/mol (&gt;7.5%) (or &lt;58 mmol/mol [&lt;7.5%] on additional treatment) at the 2 year follow-up. Overall, 64% (7/11) individuals with a diabetes duration of &lt;=11 years and an HbA1c of &lt;=69 mmol/mol (&lt;=8.5%) at time of the genetic test achieved good glycaemic control (HbA1c &lt;=58 mmol/mol [&lt;=7.5%]) with diet or sulfonylurea alone at 2 years, compared with no participants with a diabetes duration of &gt;11 years and an HbA1c of &gt;69 mmol/mol (&gt;8.5%) at the time of genetic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In participants with GCK-MODY, treatment cessation was universally successful, with no change in HbA1c at follow-up. In those with HNF1A/HNF4A-MODY, a shorter diabetes duration, lower HbA1c and lower BMI at genetic diagnosis predicted successful treatment with sulfonylurea/diet alone, supporting the need for early genetic diagnosis and treatment change. Our study suggests that, in individuals with HNF1A/HNF4A-MODY with a longer duration of diabetes (&gt;11 years) at time of genetic test, rather than ceasing current treatment, a sulfonylurea should be added to existing therapy, particularly in those who are overweight or obese and have a high HbA1c.

30259503|t|The importance of combined NGS and MLPA genetic tests for differential diagnosis of maturity onset diabetes of the young.
30259503|a|INTRODUCTION: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes. Being clinically and genetically heterogeneous, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy. MODY is caused by a single gene mutation. Thirteen genes, defining 13 subtypes, have been identified to cause MODY. A correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, prognosis, and genetic counselling. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine unrelated paediatric patients clinically suspected of having MODY diabetes were analysed using TruSight One panel for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. RESULTS: In this study we identified variants in MODY genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%). Using two genetic tests, NGS and MLPA, we detected both single nucleotide variants and large deletions in patients. Most of the patients harboured a variant in the GCK gene (11/22), followed by HNF1B (5/22). The rest of the variants were found in the NEUROD1 and HNF1A genes. We identified one novel variant in the GCK gene: c.596T&gt;C, p.Val199Ala. The applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of MODY in two patients and revealed variants in other genes possibly associated with the patient's clinical phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: In our group of MODY patients most variants were found in the GCK gene, followed by variants in HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF1A genes. The combined NGS and MLPA-based genetic tests presented a comprehensive approach for analysing patients with suspected MODY diabetes and provided a successful differential diagnosis of MODY subtypes.

30269055|t|Monogenic diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis.
30269055|a|We present a non-consanguineous family of three siblings who presented with diabetes mellitus (DM), two of whom had genetically confirmed cystic fibrosis (CF), with one pancreatic-sufficient mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (DeltaF508/R117H;IVS8-5T). A detailed history revealed family members from three successive generations diagnosed with 'type 1' or 'type 2' diabetes, leading to genetic investigations for monogenic DM. A heterozygous frameshift mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox alpha (HNF1A) gene (c.404delA) was subsequently confirmed in all three siblings, which is known to cause monogenic diabetes and is exquisitely sensitive to sulfonylurea therapy. Following this diagnosis, both siblings with CF and HNF1A monogenic diabetes were started on gliclazide therapy, while their older brother who had been wrongly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes was switched from insulin to gliclazide, all with excellent therapeutic responses.

30287671|t|Glimepiride monotherapy versus combination of glimepiride and linagliptin therapy in patients with HNF1A-diabetes: a protocol for a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
30287671|a|INTRODUCTION: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A)-diabetes is the most common monogenetic subtype of diabetes. Strict glycaemic control is crucial for a good prognosis for patients with HNF1A-diabetes. Sulfonylurea (SU) is used as a first-line therapy in HNF1A-diabetes. However, SU therapy may be problematic as it confers a high risk of hypoglycaemia. We hypothesise that low dose of SU in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor provides a safer and more efficacious treatment in patients with HNF1A-diabetes compared with SU as monotherapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a randomised, double-blinded, crossover study, patients with HNF1A-diabetes will randomly be assigned to 16 weeks of treatment with glimepiride+linagliptin, 4 weeks of washout and 16 weeks of treatment with glimepiride+placebo (or vice versa). Treatment will be evaluated with continuous glucose monitoring and combined meal and bicycle tests conducted at baseline and at the end of each of the two treatment periods. The primary end point is the absolute difference in the mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions between the two treatments (glimepiride+linagliptin vs glimepiride+placebo) at the end of each treatment period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol is approved by the Danish Medicines Agency, The Scientific-Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (H-17014518) and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The trial will be carried out and monitored in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published at scientific conferences and as one or more scientific manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals with authorship in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' recommendations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 2017-000204-15.

30293189|t|Screening of HNF1A and HNF4A mutation and clinical phenotype analysis in a large cohort of Chinese patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
30293189|a|AIMS: The study aimed to screen the HNF1A and HNF4A mutation in a large Chinese cohort of high clinical suspicion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) patients and characterize the clinical features of those patients. The performance of hsCRP as a biomarker to differentiate MODY3 from early onset T2DM was also evaluated. METHODS: A total of 74 patients with a strong clinical suspicion of MODY from 59 families and 33 newly diagnosed early-onset T2DM were included. HNF1A and HNF4A mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. ROC curves were used to identify the optimal cutoff of hsCRP. RESULTS: One novel (c.864_865insG) and six recurrent HNF1A mutations (R203H, R263H, P379T, L422P, P519L and c.873delC) in 17 patients from 8 families (13.6%), as well as one novel HNF4A (R331H) mutation were identified. Nonspecific clinical presentations were observed in MODYX compared to MODY3 patients. MODY3 subjects exhibited with younger, lower BMI, TG, fasting and postprandial C-peptide, higher HDL than T2DM. Particularly, we confirmed serum hsCRP was lower in MODY3 than T2DM. ROC curve showed a good discrimination with an AUC of 0.852 and identified a cutoff hsCRP of 0.79 (75% sensitivity and 83% specificity). Good glycemic control was observed in all identified patients after switching to glimepiride therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HNF1A mutation was relatively lower in Mainland China and HNF4A mutation was rare. Serum hsCRP concentrations performed well in discriminating MODY3 from T2DM. Molecular diagnosis of MODY3/1 did transform management in clinical practice and facilitated the glycemic control.

30377089|t|Autoantibodies against ZnT8 are rare in Central-European LADA patients and absent in MODY patients, including those positive for other autoantibodies.
30377089|a|BACKGROUND: Testing for autoantibodies against the zinc transporter ZnT8 (ZnTA) is becoming routine in pediatric diabetes. However, available data are inconclusive when focusing on adult-onset diabetes, including autoimmune diabetes, which does not require insulin at diagnosis (LADA). BASIC PROCEDURES: We examined the ZnTA prevalence and titers and matched them with the clinical phenotype and PTPN22 genotypes of Czech LADA patients who were positive for GADA and/or IA2A and had a fasting C-peptide level &gt;200 pmol/L at diagnosis as well as HNF4A-, GCK- or HNF1A-MODY patients and healthy controls. MAIN FINDINGS: Most LADA patients were negative for ZnTA, and the sensitivity of the assay was only 18-20% for patients with LADA-like progression to insulinotherapy compared to healthy controls. In LADA patients, there was no association between the ZnTA and PTPN22 risk genotypes. LADA patients positive for ZnTA had a lower BMI than those positive for other autoantibodies alone. Importantly, MODY patients were completely negative for ZnTA, and the levels of ZnTA in MODY patients were similar to those in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: ZnTA quantification did not improve LADA diagnosis. However, positivity for ZnTA can be used as a negative MODY pre-diagnostic criterion even in the region of Central and East Europe, where other islet cell autoantibodies are common in MODY patients.

30395577|t|The application of post-translational modification oriented serum proteomics to assess experimental diabetes with complications.
30395577|a|Proteome analysis of serum from type 2 diabetics with complications may lead to the discovery of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NFkappaB transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins. Our results also indicated the potential association of the hepatic secretome and hepatocyte nuclear factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications.

30421137|t|Quality of life assessment in patients with HNF1A-MODY and GCK-MODY.
30421137|a|AIM: The impact of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) on quality of life (QoL) has never been examined. We assessed disease impact on QoL among patients with HNF1A-MODY and GCK mutation carrier status. METHODS: The study included 80 patients with HNF1A-MODY and 89 GCK gene mutation carriers. We also examined 128 type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients for comparison. Diabetes-specific QoL was assessed using the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life questionnaire. RESULTS: HNF1A-MODY and GCK-MODY groups had similar mean age (41.7 vs. 38.0 years, respectively) and BMI (24.1 vs. 24.3 kg/m2), whereas T1DM patients were on average younger (34.2 years) with similar BMI (25.0 kg/m2). Less than a third of GCK mutation carriers were on pharmacotherapy (n = 20, 31%), while the majority of HNF1A mutation carriers used oral drugs or insulin (n = 66, 82.5%). While current QoL was similar across the three groups (p = 0.66), two other major indices-the impact of diabetes on QoL and the average weighted impact (AWI)-differed among them (p &lt; 0.001 for both comparisons). The impact of diabetes on patient QoL and AWI observed in both MODY groups was smaller than in T1DM. Etiological diagnosis of diabetes and a diagnosis of retinopathy were the only independent factors influencing the impact of diabetes on QoL and AWI in regression analysis. In HNF1A-MODY, all three major indices of QoL were more heavily influenced for patients on insulin in comparison to other treatment sub-groups. CONCLUSION: MODY has a smaller negative impact on QoL compared to T1DM. Mode of treatment further stratifies QoL decline for HNF1A-MODY subjects.

30447144|t|Targeted next generation sequencing in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
30447144|a|Background Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a common form of monogenic diabetes. Fourteen genes have been identified, each leading to cause a different type of MODY. The aims of this study were to reveal both known and novel variants in MODY genes in patients with MODY using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and to present the genotype-phenotype correlations. Methods Mutation analysis of MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, ABCC8, INS and KCNJ11) was performed using targeted NGS in 106 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY. The variants were evaluated according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines recommendations. Results A total of 18 (17%) variants were revealed among all patients. Seven variants in GCK, six in HNF4A, four in HNF1A and one in ABCC8 genes were found. Eight of them were previously published and 10 of them were assessed as novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Conclusions While the most frequent mutations are found in the HNF1A gene in the literature, most of the variants were found in the GCK gene in our patient group using the NGS method, which allows simultaneous analysis of multiple genes in a single panel.

30455330|t|Plasma Fucosylated Glycans and C-Reactive Protein as Biomarkers of HNF1A-MODY in Young Adult-Onset Nonautoimmune Diabetes.
30455330|a|OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to variants in HNF1A is the most common type of monogenic diabetes. Frequent misdiagnosis results in missed opportunity to use sulfonylureas as first-line treatment. A nongenetic biomarker could improve selection of subjects for genetic testing and increase diagnosis rates. We previously reported that plasma levels of antennary fucosylated N-glycans and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are reduced in individuals with HNF1A-MODY. In this study, we examined the potential use of N-glycans and hs-CRP in discriminating individuals with damaging HNF1A alleles from those without HNF1A variants in an unselected population of young adults with nonautoimmune diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the plasma N-glycan profile, measured hs-CRP, and sequenced HNF1A in 989 individuals with diabetes diagnosed when younger than age 45, persistent endogenous insulin production, and absence of pancreatic autoimmunity. Systematic assessment of rare HNF1A variants was performed. RESULTS: We identified 29 individuals harboring 25 rare HNF1A alleles, of which 3 were novel, and 12 (in 16 probands) were considered pathogenic. Antennary fucosylated N-glycans and hs-CRP were able to differentiate subjects with damaging HNF1A alleles from those without rare HNF1A alleles. Glycan GP30 had a receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (88% sensitivity, 80% specificity, cutoff 0.70%), whereas hs-CRP had an AUC of 0.83 (88% sensitivity, 69% specificity, cutoff 0.81 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Half of rare HNF1A sequence variants do not cause MODY. N-glycan profile and hs-CRP could both be used as tools, alone or as adjuncts to existing pathways, for identifying individuals at high risk of carrying a damaging HNF1A allele.

30481753|t|Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young due to Glucokinase, HNF1-A, HNF1-B, and HNF4-A Mutations in a Cohort of Turkish Children Diagnosed as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
30481753|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare condition often misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The purposes of this study were: to identify any patients followed in a large Turkish cohort as T1D, with an atypical natural history, who may in fact have MODY, and to define the criteria which would indicate patients with likely MODY as early as possible after presentation to allow prompt genetic testing. METHODS: Urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio (UCPCR) was studied in 152 patients having a diagnosis of T1D for at least 3 years. Those with a UCPCR &gt;=0.2 nmol/mmol were selected for genetic analysis of the Glucokinase (GCK), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF1A), Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (HNF4A), and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1B) genes. This UCPCR cut-off was used because of the reported high sensitivity and specificity. Cases were also evaluated using a MODY probability calculator. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients from 152 participants (15.1%) had a UCPCR indicating persistent insulin reserve. The mean age +- SD of the patients was 13.6 +- 3.6 years (range 8.30-21.6). Of these 23, two (8.7%) were found to have a mutation, one with HNF4A and one with HNF1B mutation. No mutations were detected in the GCK or HNF1A genes. CONCLUSION: In Turkish children with a diagnosis of T1D but who have persistent insulin reserve 3 years after diagnosis, up to 9% may have a genetic mutation indicating a diagnosis of MODY.

30507613|t|Human islets expressing HNF1A variant have defective beta cell transcriptional regulatory networks.
30507613|a|Using an integrated approach to characterize the pancreatic tissue and isolated islets from a 33-year-old with 17 years of type 1 diabetes (T1D), we found that donor islets contained beta cells without insulitis and lacked glucose-stimulated insulin secretion despite a normal insulin response to cAMP-evoked stimulation. With these unexpected findings for T1D, we sequenced the donor DNA and found a pathogenic heterozygous variant in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1A). In one of the first studies of human pancreatic islets with a disease-causing HNF1A variant associated with the most common form of monogenic diabetes, we found that HNF1A dysfunction leads to insulin-insufficient diabetes reminiscent of T1D by impacting the regulatory processes critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and suggest a rationale for a therapeutic alternative to current treatment.

30754209|t|Function of HNF1 in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
30754209|a|The importance of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs), as well as other transcription factors in beta-cell development and function, was underlined by the characterization of human mutations causing maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). HNF1A and HNF1B mutations lead to MODY forms 3 and 5, respectively. Thus, transcriptional control is an essential mechanism underlying the precise metabolic control exerted by beta-cells in regulating insulin release. The diabetes phenotype of MODY3 (HNF1alpha) and the phenotypes of MODY5 (HNF1beta), which can also include renal disease and genitourinary malformations, as well as neonatal diabetes and pancreatic agenesis, have now been described. However, detailed molecular pathology remains elusive. The large array of dominant-negative and deletion mutations, and the lack of structure-phenotype relationships for most mutations, have not helped us to formulate a mechanistic understanding. Further molecular studies of HNF1 actions and gene regulation are anticipated to provide useful insights into beta-cell biology and potential therapeutic tools.

30760653|t|Body mass index and C-peptide are important for the promptly differential diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes from familial type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinic.
30760653|a|Type 2 diabetic patients are becoming younger and having a tendency to family aggregation, they are easily suspected as maturity-onset diabetes of young (MODY) in the outpatient clinic and send to genetic testing. 9 diabetic families were compared in our outpatient clinic who met the primary diagnosis criteria of MODY. Detailed clinical features and laboratory data including gene sequence were collected and analyzed. The patients met the primary clinical diagnostic criteria of MODY for genetic testing at the first look. However, members of families A1 to A3 had normal Body mass index (BMI) and a lower C-peptide level which indicated impaired pancreatic islet function. In contrast, the members with diabetes of families B1 to B6 had normal or increased C-peptide level which indicated insulin resistance and were overweight with BMI. Genetic testing showed that the mutations in HNF1A, INS, KCNJ11 and so on in families A were consistent with the diagnosis of MODY. No pathogenic mutation was found in the members of families B which were diagnosed with familial T2D. Before the clinical laboratory testing and the further gene test, BMI and the concentration of C-peptide are important for the promptly differential diagnosis of MODY from familial type 2 diabetes and medication instruction in the outpatient clinic which could help to alleviate the burden of genetic testing for them.

30761081|t|A Perception on Genome-Wide Genetic Analysis of Metabolic Traits in Arab Populations.
30761081|a|Despite dedicated nation-wide efforts to raise awareness against the harmful effects of fast-food consumption and sedentary lifestyle, the Arab population continues to struggle with an increased risk for metabolic disorders. Unlike the European population, the Arab population lacks well-established genetic risk determinants for metabolic disorders, and the transferability of established risk loci to this population has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. The most recent findings have identified over 240 genetic risk loci (with ~400 independent association signals) for type 2 diabetes, but thus far only 25 risk loci (ADAMTS9, ALX4, BCL11A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, COL8A1, DUSP9, FTO, GCK, GNPDA2, HMG20A, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, IGF2BP2, JAZF1, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, MC4R, PPARgamma, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, TFAP2B, TP53INP1, and WFS1) have been replicated in Arab populations. To our knowledge, large-scale population- or family-based association studies are non-existent in this region. Recently, we conducted genome-wide association studies on Arab individuals from Kuwait to delineate the genetic determinants for quantitative traits associated with anthropometry, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and blood pressure levels. Although these studies led to the identification of novel recessive variants, they failed to reproduce the established loci. However, they provided insights into the genetic architecture of the population, the applicability of genetic models based on recessive mode of inheritance, the presence of genetic signatures of inbreeding due to the practice of consanguinity, and the pleiotropic effects of rare disorders on complex metabolic disorders. This perspective presents analysis strategies and study designs for identifying genetic risk variants associated with diabetes and related traits in Arab populations.

30778899|t|A decision algorithm to identify patients with high probability of monogenic diabetes due to HNF1A mutations.
30778899|a|PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of biomarkers of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory features to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide a diagnostic algorithm for HNF1A MODY. METHODS: We examined 77 patients with HNF1A MODY, 88 with GCK MODY mutations, 99 with type 1 diabetes, and 92 with type 2 diabetes. In addition to 1,5-AG and hsCRP, we considered body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, and fasting serum C-peptide as potential biomarkers. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were used in marker evaluation. RESULTS: Concentration of hsCRP was lowest in HNF1A MODY (0.51 mg/l) and highest in type 2 diabetes (1.33 mg/l). The level of 1,5-AG was lowest in type 1 diabetes and HNF1A MODY, 3.8 and 4.7 mug/ml, respectively, and highest (11.2 mug/ml) in GCK MODY. In the diagnostic algorithm, we first excluded patients with type 1 diabetes based on low C-peptide (C-statistic 0.98) before using high BMI and C-peptide to identify type 2 diabetes patients (C-statistic 0.92). Finally, 1,5-AG and hsCRP in conjunction yielded a C-statistic of 0.86 in discriminating HNF1A from GCK MODY. We correctly classified 92.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes, 84.8% with type 2 diabetes, 64.9% HNF1A MODY, and 52.3% GCK MODY patients. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma 1,5-AG and serum hsCRP do not discriminate sufficiently HNF1A MODY from common diabetes types, but could be potentially useful in prioritizing Sanger sequencing of HNF1A gene.

30814848|t|Identification of an HNF1A p.Gly292fs Frameshift Mutation Presenting as Diabetes During Pregnancy in a Maltese Family.
30814848|a|The diagnosis of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a challenging process in view of the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) are responsible for most forms of monogenic diabetes in Northern European populations. Genetic analysis through a combination of whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three Maltese siblings and their father identified a rare duplication/frameshift mutation in exon 4 of HNF1A that lies within a known mutational hotspot in this gene. In this report, we provide the first description of an HNF1A-MODY3 phenotype in a Maltese family. The findings reported are relevant and new to a regional population, where the epidemiology of atypical diabetes has never been studied before. This report is of clinical interest as it highlights how monogenic diabetes can be misdiagnosed as either type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes. It also reinforces the need for a better characterisation of monogenic diabetes in Mediterranean countries, particularly in island populations such as Malta with a high prevalence of diabetes.

30963309|t|Functional characterization of p.Pro409His variant in HNF1A, a hypomorphic mutation involved in pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.
30963309|a|AIMS: HNF1A is a gene coding for the transcription factor HNF1-alpha, mutated in some forms of MODY and type 2 diabetes mellitus characterized by a strong genetic component. The penetrance of HNF1A variants differs considerably; thus, to assess the genetic risk of diabetes in carrier subjects of a HNF1A mutant allele, a functional characterization of mutant forms is of paramount importance. METHODS: The HNF1A gene was sequenced in two patients with partly discordant diabetic phenotype, carrying the p.Pro409His variant. To evaluate the pathogenicity of the variant, we measured the transactivation power of the corresponding P408H HNF1-alpha mutant mouse form on HNF1-alpha target promoters. RESULTS: We found a lower but detectable activity of transactivation of the mutant form compared with the wild-type form and we excluded mechanisms of protein degradation or nuclear mislocalization. CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A mutation p.Pro409His can be considered a mild variant that confers a moderate risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in heterozygous carriers.

30977832|t|Identifying Pathogenic Variants of Monogenic Diabetes Using Targeted Panel Sequencing in an East Asian Population.
30977832|a|PURPOSE: Monogenic diabetes is a specific type of diabetes in which precision medicine could be applied. In this study, we used targeted panel sequencing to investigate pathogenic variants in Korean patients clinically suspected to have monogenic diabetes. METHODS: The eligibility criteria for inclusion were non-type 1 diabetes patients with an age of onset &lt;= 30 years and a BMI (body mass index) &lt;= 30 kg/m2. Among the 2,090 non-type 1 diabetes patients, 109 were suspected to have monogenic diabetes and subjected to genetic testing. We analyzed 30 monogenic diabetes genes using targeted panel sequencing. The pathogenicity of the genetic variants was evaluated according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines. RESULTS: Among the 109 suspected monogenic diabetes patients, 23 (21.1%) patients harbored pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. A total of 14 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of common maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes were identified in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF1B. Other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in WFS1, INS, ABCC8 and FOXP3. The mitochondrial DNA 3243 A&gt;G variant was identified in five participants. Patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants had a significantly higher MODY probability, a lower BMI, and a lower C-peptide level than those without pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P=0.007, P=0.001, and P=0.012, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Using targeted panel sequencing followed by pathogenicity evaluation, we were able to make molecular genetic diagnoses for 23 (21.1%) suspected monogenic diabetes patients. Lower BMI, higher MODY probability, and lower C-peptide levels were characteristics of these participants.

31098941|t|Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young is Not Necessarily Associated with Autosomal Inheritance: Case Description of a De Novo HFN1A Mutation.
31098941|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for up to 4% of all cases of diabetes in pediatric patients. MODY is usually characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, impaired insulin secretion, and an average age at diagnosis of 18-26 years. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), glucokinase, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-beta genes are the mutations most frequently observed in cases of MODY. We herein report a case of HNF1A-MODY characterized by an early onset of diabetes. Genetic investigations revealed a de novo heterozygous substitution, N237D (HNF1A c.709A&gt;G), in exon 3 of the HNF1A gene. Our case supports the hypothesis that de novo mutations are more frequent than expected. This recent evidence may suggest that conventional clinical diagnostic criteria for MODY should be revised and personalized according to the individual patient.

31109344|t|HNF1A gene p.I27L is associated with early-onset, maturity-onset diabetes of the young-like diabetes in Turkey.
31109344|a|BACKGROUND: The molecular basis of the Turkish population with suspected maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has not been identified. This is the first study to investigate the association between HNF1A-gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and having early-onset, MODY-like diabetes mellitus in the Turkish population. METHODS: All diabetic patients (N = 565) who presented to our clinic between 2012 and 2015 with a clinical suspicion of MODY were included in the study. Analysis of HNF1A, HNFB, HNF4A, GCK gene mutations was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction sequencing. After genetic analysis, diabetics (n = 46) with HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF4A, GCK gene mutations (diagnosed as MODY) and diabetics (n = 30) with HNF1B, HNF4A, GCK gene SNPs were excluded. Patients with early-onset, MODY-like diabetes (n = 486) and non-diabetic controls (n = 263) were included. Genetic analyses for the HNF1A gene p.S487 N (rs2464196), p.A98V (rs1800574) and p.I27L (rs1169288) SNPs were performed using Sanger-based DNA sequencing among the control group. RESULTS: p.S487 N and p.A98V was similar between the diabetics and controls in dominant and recessive models with no association (each, p &gt; 0.05). p.I27L GT/TT carriers (GT/TT vs. GG, OR = 1.68, 95% CI: [1. 21-2.13]; p = 0.035) and p.I27L TT carriers had increased risk of having MODY-like diabetes (GT/GG vs. TT, OR = 1.56, 95% CI: [1. 14-2.57]; p = 0.048). Family inheritance of diabetes was significantly more common in patients with the p.I27L TT genotype. The p.I27L SNP was modestly associated with having diabetes after adjusting for body mass index and age (beta = 1.45, 95% CI: [1. 2-4.2]; p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The HNF1A gene p.I27L SNP was modestly associated with having early-onset, MODY-like diabetes in the Turkish population. HNF1A gene p.I27L SNP might contribute to age at diabetes diagnosis and family inheritance.

31114636|t|Maternal genetic contribution to pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational weight gain, and gestational diabetes mellitus.
31114636|a|Introduction: Pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with each other. This is the first study to investigate whether genetic variants were associated with having GDM, and whether genetic variants-related GDM were associated with adiposity including pre-pregnancy obesity and excessive GWG in Turkish women. Patients and methods: Women with GDM (n = 160) and without GDM (n = 145) were included in case-controlled study. Genotyping of the HNF1A gene (p.I27L rs1169288, p.98V rs1800574, p.S487N rs2464196), the VDR gene (p.BsmI rs1544410, p.ApaI rs7975232, p.TaqI rs731236, p.FokI rs2228570), and FTO gene (rs9939609) SNPs were performed by using RT-PCR. Results: The FTO AA genotype was associated with an increased risk of having GDM (AA vs. AT + TT, 24.4% vs. 12.4%, OR = 2.27, 95% CI [1.23-4.19], p = 0.007). The HNF1A p.I27L GT/TT genotype was associated with increased GDM risk (GT + TT vs. GG-wild, 79.4% vs. 65.5%, OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.38], p = 0.007). However, all VDR gene SNPs and the HNF1A p.A98V, p.S487N were not associated with having GDM (p &gt; 0.05). The FTO AA genotype was associated with an increased risk for pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (OR = 1.43, 95% CI [1.25-3.4], p = 0.035), but not associated with excessive GWG after adjusting for pre-pregnancy weight (p &gt; 0.05). Pre-pregnancy weight, weight at delivery, and GWG did not differ in both VDR and HNF1A gene carriers (p &gt; 0.05). HOMA-IR and HbA1c were increased in both p.I27L TT and FTO AA genotype carriers (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The adiposity-related gene FTO is associated with GDM by the effect of FTO on pre-pregnancy obesity. The diabetes-related p.I27L gene is associated with GDM by increasing insulin resistance.

31119523|t|Congenital Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia and Hyperammonemia due to Pathogenic Variants in GLUD1.
31119523|a|Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion. Pathogenic variants in at least twelve different genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, HNF1A, UCP2, TRMT10A HK1, and PGM1) are known to cause CHI. Pathogenic variants in the GLUD1 gene, which encodes the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), account for 5% of the cases of congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Pathogenic variants in GLUD1 typically present in late infancy, are diet and/or diazoxide-responsive and cause protein-induced hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia as insulin secretion is triggered by allosteric activation of GDH by leucine. The authors are presenting three unrelated Indian children, who manifested with fasting as well as dietary protein induced hypoglycemia in late infancy, and were diagnosed to have hyperinsulinemic hyperammonemic hypoglycemia due to pathogenic variants in GLUD1. Although the hypoglycemia responded to diazoxide, delayed diagnosis and irregular treatment had resulted in neurological problems in two of the three children. Early identification, appropriate dietary modifications and regular treatment with diazoxide can prevent adverse neurological outcome.

31166087|t|Liver adenomatosis in patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha maturity onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY): Clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics in a French series.
31166087|a|BACKGROUND: Liver adenomatosis (LA) is a rare disease resulting from biallelic inactivation of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) gene, which induces the proliferation of adenoma cells in liver parenchyma. Liver adenomatosis has only been documented in case reports from patients carrying a HNF1A germline mutation. We have evaluated the frequency of LA among a large cohort of patients with HNF1A-maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), previously termed "MODY3," and herein describe its clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics. METHODS: In all, 137 HNF1A-MODY subjects from 74 families were screened by liver ultrasonography in 13 centers, and 15 additional cases of LA were later included in the series. Liver adenomatosis was confirmed by liver computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or histopathology. RESULTS: Among 137 carriers of an HNF1A mutation, 9 patients (6.5%) from seven families were diagnosed with LA. Diabetes mellitus was present in 87.5% of patients with LA. In 25% of patients, LA was diagnosed due to intra-abdominal or intratumoral bleeding. Liver biochemistry was near normal in all patients. Liver imaging showed adenomas of various sizes and numbers. On MRI, most nodules had the radiological characteristics of steatotic adenomas. Histopathological confirmation of LA was available in 13 cases, and these adenomas were mostly steatotic. Surgery was initially performed in 37.5% of patients, and liver disease progression was observed in 30%. No disease progression was observed in 14 pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of LA in a cohort of screened HNF1A-MODY patients and the high incidence of LA progression and/or hemorrhage warrants systematic screening for liver adenomatosis in HNF1A-MODY families.

31214998|t|Using Clinical Indices to Distinguish MODY2 (GCK Mutation) and MODY3 (HNF1A Mutation) from Type 1 Diabetes in a Young Chinese Population.
31214998|a|INTRODUCTION: Accurate diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is required in order to select appropriate treatment options and to assess prognosis. The aim of this study was to explore potential clinical indicators that could be used to differentiate MODY2, MODY3, and type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young subjects. METHODS: Twelve patients with MODY3 and 29 patients with MODY2 were characterized and compared to 26 patients with T1D. These three groups were matched for age and gender. Clinical profiles of the 67 patients were collected. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the optimal cutoff values of clinical indicators. RESULTS: Compared to patients with T1D, subjects with MODY3 had higher fasting C-peptide levels (1.34 +- 1.51 vs. 0.29 +- 0.22 ng/mL; P  &lt; 0.001) and lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels (0.18 +- 0.15 vs. 1.22 +- 1.49 mg/L, P  = 0.004); patients with MODY2 had lower hsCRP (0.37 +- 0.39 vs. 1.22 +- 1.49 mg/L; P  = 0.003), total cholesterol (4.12 +- 0.68 vs. 4.61 +- 0.81 mmol/L, P  = 0.034), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (2.24 +- 0.68 vs. 2.67 +- 0.79 ng/L, P  = 0.002) levels and higher fasting C-peptide levels (0.96 +- 0.42 vs. 0.29 +- 0.22 ng/mL, P  = 0.002). The ROC-derived hsCRP values for discriminating MODY2 from T1D, MODY3 from T1D, and MODY3 from MODY2 were 0.675, 0.833, and 0.763, respectively. The ROC-derived fasting C-peptide levels for discriminating MODY2 from T1D and MODY3 from T1D were 0.951 and 0.975, respectively. The ROC-derived total cholesterol and LDL-C values for discriminating MODY2 from T1D were 0.670 and 0.662, respectively; the ROC-derived triglyceride value for discriminating MODY3 from MODY2 was 0.756. Additionally, a combination of indicators permitted better discrimination of MODY subtypes than any single parameter. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that fasting C-peptide, hsCRP, and lipid levels permit good discrimination among MODY2, MODY3, and T1D. These clinical indicators could be used as markers of MODY2 and MODY3 in young patients with diabetes.

31215021|t|Altered N-glycosylation profiles as potential biomarkers and drug targets in diabetes.
31215021|a|N-glycosylation is a ubiquitous protein modification, and N-glycosylation profiles are emerging as both biomarkers and functional effectors in various types of diabetes. Genome-wide association studies identified glycosyltransferase genes as candidate causal genes for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Studies focused on N-glycosylation changes in type 2 diabetes demonstrated that patients can be distinguished from healthy controls based on N-glycome composition. In addition, individuals at an increased risk of future disease development could be identified based on N-glycome profiles. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that N-glycans have a major role in preventing the impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by maintaining the glucose transporter in proper orientation, indicating that interindividual variation in protein N-glycosylation might be a novel risk factor contributing to diabetes development. Defective N-glycosylation of T cells has been implicated in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. Furthermore, studies of N-glycan alterations have successfully been used to identify individuals with rare types of diabetes (such as the HNF1A-MODY), and also to evaluate functional significance of novel diabetes-associated mutations. In conclusion, both N-glycans and glycosyltransferases emerge as potential therapeutic targets in diabetes.

31216263|t|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in Chinese children: genes and clinical phenotypes.
31216263|a|Background To investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of Chinese children with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Methods A total of 42 Chinese patients suspected MODY referred to our unit from 2014 to 2018 were enrolled. Mutational analysis of monogenic diabetes mellitus genes was performed by next-generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results There were 28 males (66.7%) and 14 females (33.3%) with a mean age of 9.49 +- 3.46 years (range, 1.4-15.3 years) and a mean birth weight of 3.38 +- 0.49 kg (range, 2.55-4.90 kg). Among these patients, 15 patients had polyuria, polydipsia or weight loss. Two patients (4.8%) were obese and six (14.3%) were overweight. Moreover, 13 patients (30.9%) had a family history of diabetes. Thirty variants were identified in 28 patients. Twenty-six variants in 25 patients were pathogenic or likely pathogenic genes (59.5%, 25/42), including 15 patients (60.0%, 15/25) with GCK mutation, four (16.0%, 4/25) with PAX4 mutation, three (12.0%, 3/25) with HNF4A mutation, one (4.0%, 1/25) with INS mutation, one (4.0%, 1/25) with NEUROD1 mutation and one (4.0%, 1/25) with HNF1A mutation. Nine mutations (36.0%, 9/25) were novel. There was no difference between mutation-suspected patients and MODY-confirmed patients except for a 2-h glucose increment in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), while the GCK-MODY had lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and a significantly smaller 2-h glucose increment in an OGTT compared with transcription factor MODYs. The GCK-MODY was identified by incidental hyperglycemia without glycosuria. GCK-MODY without drug management and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF4A) or HNF1A-MODY with sulfonylurea therapy obtained good glucose controlling. Conclusions Mutation of the GCK gene is the most common in MODY patients in China followed by PAX4. The screening criteria can improve the cost-effectiveness of disease diagnosis and treatment. A precise molecular diagnosis would lead to optimal treatment of the patients.

31223625|t|HNF1alpha Controls Liver Lipid Metabolism and Insulin Resistance via Negatively Regulating the SOCS-3-STAT3 Signaling Pathway.
31223625|a|This study is aimed at evaluating the effects, functions, and mechanism of HNF1alpha on hepatic glycolipid metabolism. In this study, free fatty acid- (FFA-) induced steatosis of hepatocyte liver cell LO2 was used as an in vitro model. The methods of Oil Red O staining, RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect LO2-regulated HNF1alpha expression and its effects on FFA-induced LO2 cell steatosis, the insulin signaling and SOCS-3-STAT3 signaling pathways, the expression of lipid metabolism-related regulators, and phosphorylation. With increased FFA induction time, the expression of HNF1alpha in the LO2 fatty degeneration hepatic cells gradually decreased. Downregulation of HNF1alpha expression aggravated FFA-induced steatosis of LO2 hepatocytes. HNF1alpha promotes activation of the insulin pathway and oxidative breakdown of fat and inhibits lipid anabolism. Inhibitors of STAT3 can reverse the regulation of decreased HNF1alpha expression on the insulin signaling pathway and fat metabolism. We also confirmed this pathway using HNF1alpha-/- mice combining treatment with STAT3 inhibitor NSC 74859 in vivo. HNF1alpha regulates hepatic lipid metabolism by promoting the expression of SOCS-3 and negatively regulating the STAT3 signaling pathway.

31363388|t|HNF1A mutation in a Thai patient with maturity-onset diabetes of the young: A case report.
31363388|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes. The disease is transmitted in autosomal dominant mode and diabetes is usually diagnosed before age 25 year. MODY 3 is caused by mutation of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1A genes and is the most common MODY subtype. Diagnosis of MODY 3 is crucial since glycemic control can be accomplished by very low dose of sulfonylurea. In this report we described a Thai MODY 3 patient who had excellence plasma glucose control by treating with glicazide 20 mg per day and insulin therapy can be discontinued. CASE SUMMARY: A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed diabetes mellitus at 14 years old. The disease was transmitted from her grandmother and mother compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Sanger sequencing of proband's DNA identified mutation of HNF1A at codon 203 which changed amino acid from arginine to cysteine (R203C). This mutation was carried only by family members who have diabetes. The patient has been treated effectively with a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and must include a very low dose of glicazide (20 mg/d). Insulin therapy was successfully discontinued. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a first case of pharmacogenetics in Thai MODY 3 patient. Our findings underscore the essential role of molecular genetics in diagnosis and guidance of appropriate treatment of diabetes mellitus in particular patient.

31365591|t|Negative autoimmunity in a Spanish pediatric cohort suspected of type 1 diabetes, could it be monogenic diabetes?
31365591|a|OBJECTIVE: Monogenic diabetes can be misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes in children. The right diagnosis is crucial for both therapeutic choice and prognosis and influences genetic counseling. The main objective of this study was to search for monogenic diabetes in Spanish pediatric patients suspected of type 1 diabetes with lack of autoimmunity at the onset of the disease. We also evaluated the extra value of ZnT8A in addition to the classical IAA, GADA and IA2A autoantibodies to improve the accuracy of type 1 diabetes diagnosis. METHODS: Four hundred Spanish pediatric patients with recent-onset diabetes (mean age 8.9 +- 3.9 years) were analyzed for IAA, GADA, IA2A and ZnT8A pancreatic-autoantibodies and HLA-DRB1 alleles. Patients without autoimmunity and those with only ZnT8A positive were screened for 12 monogenic diabetes genes by next generation sequencing. RESULTS: ZnT8A testing increased the number of autoantibody-positive patients from 373 (93.3%) to 377 (94.3%). An isolated positivity for ZnT8A allowed diagnosing autoimmune diabetes in 14.8% (4/27) of pediatric patients negative for the rest of the antibodies tested. At least 2 of the 23 patients with no detectable autoimmunity (8%) carried heterozygous pathogenic variants: one previously reported missense variant in the INS gene (p.Gly32Ser) and one novel frameshift variant (p.Val264fs) in the HNF1A gene. One variant of uncertain significance was also found. Carriers of pathogenic variants had HLA-DRB1 risk alleles for autoimmune diabetes and clinical characteristics compatible with type 1 diabetes except for the absence of autoimmunity. CONCLUSION: ZnT8A determination improves the diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes in pediatrics. At least 8% of pediatric patients suspected of type 1 diabetes and with undetectable autoimmunity have monogenic diabetes and can benefit from the correct diagnosis of the disease by genetic study.

31374199|t|Modeling Monogenic Diabetes using Human ESCs Reveals Developmental and Metabolic Deficiencies Caused by Mutations in HNF1A.
31374199|a|Human monogenic diabetes, caused by mutations in genes involved in beta cell development and function, has been a challenge to study because multiple mouse models have not fully recapitulated the human disease. Here, we use genome edited human embryonic stem cells to understand the most common form of monogenic diabetes, MODY3, caused by mutations in the transcription factor HNF1A. We found that HNF1A is necessary to repress an alpha cell gene expression signature, maintain endocrine cell function, and regulate cellular metabolism. In addition, we identified the human-specific long non-coding RNA, LINKA, as an HNF1A target necessary for normal mitochondrial respiration. These findings provide a possible explanation for the species difference in disease phenotypes observed with HNF1A mutations and offer mechanistic insights into how the HNF1A gene may also influence type 2 diabetes.

31483937|t|Diagnosis of hepatocellular adenoma in men before onset of diabetes in HNF1A-MODY: Watch out for winkers.
31483937|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenetic, autosomal dominantly inherited form of diabetes. HNF1A-MODY is associated with HNF1A-inactivated hepatocellular adenoma (H-HCA) formation. Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) are benign liver tumours and related complications are rare but serious: hepatic haemorrhage and malignant transformation. Guidelines recommend resection of all HCA in men and do not take any co-occurring metabolic disorders into account. We report a family with HCA preceding diabetes mellitus. Male index patient presented with numerous, irresectable HCA. After initial diagnostic and aetiologic uncertainty HNF1A germline mutation c.815G&gt;A (p.Arg272His) was confirmed 8 years later. No HCA-related complications occurred. His diabetic mother was diagnosed with HCA after severe hepatic haemorrhage years before. HNF1A-MODY should be considered in (non-)diabetic (male) patients with H-HCA. We advocate liver biopsy and, if necessary, genetic analysis to precede any intervention for HCA in males and screening for HCA in HNF1A-MODY patients.

31517624|t|Novel insights into genetics and clinics of the HNF1A-MODY.
31517624|a|MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) is a type of diabetes resulting from a pathogenic effect of gene mutations. Up to date, 13 MODY genes are known. Gene HNF1A is one of the most common causes of MODY diabetes (HNF1A-MODY; MODY3). This gene is polymorphic and more than 1200 pathogenic and non-pathogenic HNF1A variants were described in its UTRs, exons and introns. For HNF1A-MODY, not just gene but also phenotype heterogeneity is typical. Although there are some clinical instructions, HNF1A-MODY patients often do not meet every diagnostic criteria or they are still misdiagnosed as type 1 and type 2 diabetics. There is a constant effort to find suitable biomarkers to help with in distinguishing of MODY3 from Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). DNA sequencing is still necessary for unambiguous confirmation of clinical suspicion of MODY. NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) methods brought discoveries of multiple new gene variants and new instructions for their pathogenicity classification were required. The most actual problem is classification of variants with uncertain significance (VUS) which is a stumbling-block for clinical interpretation. Since MODY is a hereditary disease, DNA analysis of family members is helpful or even crucial. This review is updated summary about HNF1A-MODY genetics, pathophysiology, clinics functional studies and variant classification.

31524257|t|Identification of core genes and pathways in type 2 diabetes mellitus by bioinformatics analysis.
31524257|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder. Numerous proteins have been identified that are associated with the occurrence and development of T2DM. This study aimed to identify potential core genes and pathways involved in T2DM, through exhaustive bioinformatic analyses using GSE20966 microarray profiles of pancreatic beta-cells obtained from healthy controls and patients with T2DM. The original microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Data were processed by the limma package in R software and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Gene Ontology functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were carried out to identify potential biological functions and pathways of the DEGs. Key transcription factors were identified using the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) and Enrichr. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was used to establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the DEGs. In total, 329 DEGs were involved in T2DM, with 208 upregulated genes enriched in pancreatic secretion and the complement and coagulation cascades, and 121 downregulated genes enriched in insulin secretion, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and the Toll-like receptor pathway. Furthermore, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were key transcription factors in T2DM. Twenty important nodes were detected in the PPI network. Finally, two core genes, serpin family G member 1 (SERPING1) and alanyl aminopeptidase, membrane (ANPEP), were shown to be associated with the development of T2DM. On the whole, the findings of this study enhance our understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms of T2DM and provide potential targets for further research.

31558549|t|The Impact of Biomarker Screening and Cascade Genetic Testing on the Cost-Effectiveness of MODY Genetic Testing.
31558549|a|OBJECTIVE: In the U.S., genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is frequently delayed because of difficulty with insurance coverage. Understanding the economic implications of clinical genetic testing is imperative to advance precision medicine for diabetes. The objective of this article is to assess the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing, preceded by biomarker screening and followed by cascade genetic testing of first-degree relatives, for subtypes of MODY in U.S. pediatric patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used simulation models of distinct forms of diabetes to forecast the clinical and economic consequences of a systematic genetic testing strategy compared with usual care over a 30-year time horizon. In the genetic testing arm, patients with MODY received treatment changes (sulfonylureas for HNF1A- and HNF4A-MODY associated with a 1.0% reduction in HbA1c; no treatment for GCK-MODY). Study outcomes included costs, life expectancy (LE), and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: The strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing was cost-saving as it increased average quality of life (+0.0052 QALY) and decreased costs (-$191) per simulated patient relative to the control arm. Adding cascade genetic testing increased quality-of-life benefits (+0.0081 QALY) and lowered costs further (-$735). CONCLUSIONS: A combined strategy of biomarker screening and genetic testing for MODY in the U.S. pediatric diabetes population is cost-saving compared with usual care, and the addition of cascade genetic testing accentuates the strategy's benefits. Widespread implementation of this strategy could improve the lives of patients with MODY while saving the health system money, illustrating the potential population health benefits of personalized medicine.

31561694|t|From Individualized to Personalized Medicine in Diabetes: An Expert Overview.
31561694|a|Personalized medicine is an individualized and stratified approach to the management of a disease. Personalized medicine can reform the prevention, prediction, and management of diabetes. Use of genetic information in polygenic and monogenic forms of diabetes can help to identify genetic variants and reclassify patients into pathophysiological subgroups. Targeted diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions can be defined for these groups for effective management of diabetes. Pharmacogenetics combines genotypic and phenotypic factors to develop personalized care in various pathophysiological subgroups of persons with diabetes. Personalized medicine finds wider utility in monogenic (especially Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) and Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus [NDM]) than in polygenic, diabetes. The most frequently mutated genes in MODY include HNF1A and HNF3A. the common genes responsible for NDM include KCNJ11 and ABCC8 (SUR) genes. These genes influence various aspects of glucose metabolism such as beta-cell K-ATP channel modulation, production of insulin and development of pancreas. The Madras Diabetes Research Foundation has fostered research in personalized medicine for diabetes based upon genetic information and has developed a national registry for neonatal diabetes and other monogenic form of diabetes.

31571208|t|The role of genetics and epigenetics in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus.
31571208|a|Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders whose common trait is chronic hyperglycemia. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the subtypes of DM that manifests during pregnancy. It is believed that 2%-5% of pregnancies worldwide are complicated with GDM, with the prevalence having significantly increased over the last decade. While the pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown, GDM is believed to be a result of interactions between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Linkage and association studies, including those that are genome-wide, have allowed us to identify complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that lead to the development of GDM. Multiple common variants in candidate genes such as potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11), glucokinase (GCK), or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) have been found to increase the disease risk. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the current knowledge concerning the influence of genetics and epigenetics on the development of GDM.

31576961|t|MODY probability calculator for GCK and HNF1A screening in a multiethnic background population.
31576961|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the frequency of monogenic diabetes, which is poorly studied in multiethnic populations, due to GCK or HNF1A mutations in patients with suggestive clinical characteristics from the Brazilian population, as well as investigate if the MODY probability calculator (MPC) could help patients with their selection. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were patients with DM diagnosed before 35 years; body mass index &lt; 30 kg/m2; negative autoantibodies; and family history of DM in two or more generations. We sequenced HNF1A in 27 patients and GCK in seven subjects with asymptomatic mild fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, we calculated MODY probability with MPC. RESULTS: We identified 11 mutations in 34 patients (32.3%). We found three novel mutations. In the GCK group, six cases had mutations (85.7%), and their MODY probability on MPC was higher than 50%. In the HNF1A group, five of 27 individuals had mutations (18.5%). The MPC was higher than 75% in 11 subjects (including all five cases with HNF1A mutations). CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of the studied patients have GCK or HNF1A mutations. Inclusion criteria included efficiency in detecting patients with GCK mutations but not for HNF1A mutations (&lt; 20%). MPC was helpful in narrowing the number of candidates for HNF1A screening.

31588541|t|Monogenic Forms of Diabetes Mellitus.
31588541|a|In addition to the common types of diabetes mellitus, two major monogenic diabetes forms exist. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) represents a heterogenous group of monogenic, autosomal dominant diseases. MODY accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases, and it is not just underdiagnosed but often misdiagnosed to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. More than a dozen MODY genes have been identified to date, and their molecular classification is of great importance in the correct treatment decision and in the judgment of the prognosis. The most prevalent subtypes are HNF1A, GCK, and HNF4A. Genetic testing for MODY has changed recently due to the technological advancements, as contrary to the sequential testing performed in the past, nowadays all MODY genes can be tested simultaneously by next-generation sequencing. The other major group of monogenic diabetes is neonatal diabetes mellitus which can be transient or permanent, and often the diabetes is a part of a syndrome. It is a severe monogenic disease appearing in the first 6 months of life. The hyperglycemia usually requires insulin. There are two forms, permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). In TNDM, the diabetes usually reverts within several months but might relapse later in life. The incidence of NDM is 1:100,000-1:400,000 live births, and PNDM accounts for half of the cases. Most commonly, neonatal diabetes is caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the beta cell. Neonatal diabetes has experienced a quick and successful transition into the clinical practice since the discovery of the molecular background. In case of both genetic diabetes groups, recent guidelines recommend genetic testing.

31604004|t|Next Generation Sequencing Targeted Gene Panel in Greek MODY patients increases diagnostic accuracy.
31604004|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) constitutes a genetically and clinically heterogeneous type of Monogenic Diabetes. It is characterized by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a defect in pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion. To date, various MODY subtypes have been reported, each one of a distinct genetic etiology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the molecular defects of 50 patients with MODY employing the methodology of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Targeted Gene Panel. METHODS: A panel of seven MODY genes was designed and employed to screen 50 patients fulfilling the MODY diagnostic criteria. Patients with no pathogenic, likely pathogenic or uncertain significance variants detected, were further tested by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) for Copy Number Variations (CNVs). RESULTS: Eight different pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 8 MODY patients (diagnostic rate 16%). Five variants of uncertain significance were also detected in 7 MODY patients. Five novel pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were detected in the genes GCK; p.Cys371X, HNF1A; p.Asn402Tyr, HNF4A; p.Glu285Lys and ABCC8; p.Met1514Thr and p.Ser1386Phe. Two de novo heterozygous deletions of the entire HNF1B gene were detected in two patients, raising the diagnostic rate to 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Although many MODY patients still remain without exact MODY type identification, the application of NGS methodology provided rapid results, increased diagnostic accuracy, and was cost-effective compared to Sanger sequencing. Accurate genetic diagnosis of the MODY subtype is important for treatment selection, disease prognosis and family counselling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

31638168|t|Whole-exome sequencing in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus reveals a wide spectrum of genetic variants in MODY-related and unrelated genes.
31638168|a|The present study reports on the frequency and the spectrum of genetic variants causative of monogenic diabetes in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. The present study included 60 unrelated Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Genetic variants were screened using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a panel of 35 genes causative of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and transient or permanent neonatal diabetes. Verification of the WES results was performed using PCR-direct sequencing. A total of 38 genetic variants were identified in 33 out of 60 patients (55%). The majority of patients (27/33, 81.8%) had variants in MODY-related genes: GCK (n=19), HNF1A (n=2), PAX4 (n=1), ABCC8 (n=1), KCNJ11 (n=1), GCK+HNF1A (n=1), GCK+BLK (n=1) and GCK+BLK+WFS1 (n=1). A total of 6 patients (6/33, 18.2%) had variants in MODY-unrelated genes: GATA6 (n=1), WFS1 (n=3), EIF2AK3 (n=1) and SLC19A2 (n=1). A total of 15 out of 38 variants were novel, including GCK, HNF1A, BLK, WFS1, EIF2AK3 and SLC19A2. To summarize, the present study demonstrates a high frequency and a wide spectrum of genetic variants causative of monogenic diabetes in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. The spectrum includes previously known and novel variants in MODY-related and unrelated genes, with multiple variants in a number of patients. The prevalence of GCK variants indicates that diagnostics of monogenic diabetes in Russian children may begin with testing for MODY2. However, the remaining variants are present at low frequencies in 9 different genes, altogether amounting to ~50% of the cases and highlighting the efficiency of using WES in non-GCK-MODY cases.

31638358|t|The utility of MODY Probability Calculator in probands of families with early-onset autosomal dominant diabetes from Poland.
31638358|a|BACKGROUND: Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) accounts for 1-2% of all diabetes cases. Unfortunately, ca. 90% of MODY cases are misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A proper genetic diagnosis based on automatic sequencing is crucial for the use of a tailored treatment. However, this method is still expensive and, thus, patients selection for testing should be performed precisely. In 2012, an easy-to-use tool was developed in Exeter, UK, to support genetic testing for MODY in the British population. The aim of the study was to assess the utility of MODY Probability Calculator in probands from Polish families with early-onset autosomal dominant diabetes. METHODS: We have performed a retrospective analysis of 155 probands who were qualified for genetic testing between 2006 and 2018. Probands were recruited for MODY testing based on the following criteria: a) early age of diagnosis (&lt;=35 years); b) a positive, multigenerational family history of diabetes. Automatic sequencing, Sanger and, in case of initial negative results, New Generation Sequencing (NGS) of a set of 28 genes, were performed. MODY Probability was calculated on the website: www.diabetesgenes.org. RESULTS: The group of probands consisted of 64 GCK-, 37 HNF1A- and 3 HNF4A-MODY patients and 51 NGS-negative subjects. The median positive predictive value (PPV) was 75.5% (75.5- 75.5), 49.4% (24.4-75.5), 45.5% (21.0-75.5) and 49.4% (32.9-75.5)for GCK-, HNF1A-, HNF4A-MODY and NGS-negative, respectively. The discriminative accuracy, as expressed by AUC, of PPV between MODY and NGS negative groups was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52-0.71) with the corresponding sensitivity of 71.2% and specificity of 51.0%. CONCLUSIONS: In this highly pre-selected group of probands that were qualified for genetic testing based on clinical features, the use of MODY Probability Calculator would not substantially improve the patients selection process for genetic testing. Further efforts to improve this tool are desirable.

31658956|t|High prevalence of a monogenic cause in Han Chinese diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, partly driven by non-syndromic recessive WFS1 mutations.
31658956|a|It is estimated that ~1% of European-ancestry patients clinically diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) actually have monogenic forms of the disease. Because of the much lower incidence of true T1D in East Asians, we hypothesised that the percentage would be much higher.To test this, we sequenced the exome of 82 Chinese Han patients clinically diagnosed as T1D but negative for three autoantibodies. Analysis focused on established or proposed mongenic diabetes genes.We found credible mutations in 18 of the 82 autoantibody-negative patients (19.5%). All mutations had consensus pathogenicity support by five algorithms. As in Europeans, the most common gene was HNF1A (MODY3), in 6/18 cases. Surprisingly, almost as frequent were diallelic mutations in WFS1, known to cause Wolfram syndrome but also described in non-syndromic cases. Fasting C-peptide varied widely and was not predictive.Given the 27.4% autoantibody negativity in Chinese and 22% mutation rate, we estimate that around 6% of Chinese with a clinical T1D diagnosis have monogenic diabetes.Our findings support universal sequencing of autoantibody-negative cases as standard of care in East Asian patients with a clinical T1D diagnosis. Non-syndromic diabetes with WSF1 mutations is not rare in Chinese. Its response to alternative treatments should be investigated.

31673528|t|Genetic Study of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha Variants in Development of Early-Onset Diabetes Type 2 and Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young 3 in Iran.
31673528|a|Background: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diabetes characterized by noninsulin-dependent, autosomal-dominant disorder with strong familial history, early age of onset, and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Mutations in at least 14 different genes are responsible for various MODY subtypes. Heterozygous mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) gene are responsible for the MODY3 subtype, which is a common subtype of MODY in different studied populations. To date, more than 450 different variants of this gene have been reported as disease causing for MODY3. This study was carried out to evaluate HNF1A mutations in Iranian diabetic families fulfilling MODY criteria. Materials and Methods: Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were performed. All the ten exons of the HNF1A gene were sequenced in ten families, followed by cosegregation analysis and in silico evaluation. Computational protein modeling was accomplished for the identified mutation. Results: MODY3 was confirmed in two large families by detecting a mutation (p.G253E) in coding regions of HNF1A. Compound heterozygous state for two common variants in HNF1A (p.I27 L and p.S487N) was detected in affected members of 5 families, and in one family, a rare benign variant in the coding sequence for Kozak sequence was detected. Two new nonpathogenic variants were found in noncoding regions of HNF1A. Conclusion: It seems that HNF1A mutations are a common cause of MODY in Iranian diabetic patients. Identified common variants in heterozygous state can cause diabetes Type II in earlier ages. The role of rare variant rs3455720 is unknown, and more investigation is needed to uncover the function of this variant.

31682881|t|Hypoglycemia and antihyperglycemic treatment in adult MODY patients - a systematic review of literature.
31682881|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a heterogeneous group of diseases caused by a single mutation in one of the 14 genes involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A genes are among the most common genes affected. Expression of these genes in the key organs for defense against hypoglycemia and their participation in counter-regulation to hypoglycemia may potentially put individuals with a heterozygous mutation in these genes at increased risk for hypoglycemia. In HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY patients, normal or even increased insulin sensitivity together with glucose-independent mechanism of action of the first-line therapy - sulphonylurea derivatives - often leads to hypoglycemia, even at the much lower dose used in type 2 diabetes. This review aims to analyze clinical studies and case reports concerning hypoglycemia associated with antihyperglycemic treatment in adult MODY patients.

31703101|t|Metformin strongly affects transcriptome of peripheral blood cells in healthy individuals.
31703101|a|Metformin is a commonly used antihyperglycaemic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of action, underlying the various therapeutic effects of metformin, remain elusive. The goal of this study was to evaluate the alterations in longitudinal whole-blood transcriptome profiles of healthy individuals after a one-week metformin intervention in order to identify the novel molecular targets and further prompt the discovery of predictive biomarkers of metformin response. Next generation sequencing-based transcriptome analysis revealed metformin-induced differential expression of genes involved in intestinal immune network for IgA production and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Significantly elevated faecal sIgA levels during administration of metformin, and its correlation with the expression of genes associated with immune response (CXCR4, HLA-DQA1, MAP3K14, TNFRSF21, CCL4, ACVR1B, PF4, EPOR, CXCL8) supports a novel hypothesis of strong association between metformin and intestinal immune system, and for the first time provide evidence for altered RNA expression as a contributing mechanism of metformin's action. In addition to universal effects, 4 clusters of functionally related genes with a subject-specific differential expression were distinguished, including genes relevant to insulin production (HNF1B, HNF1A, HNF4A, GCK, INS, NEUROD1, PAX4, PDX1, ABCC8, KCNJ11) and cholesterol homeostasis (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9). This inter-individual variation of the metformin effect on the transcriptional regulation goes in line with well-known variability of the therapeutic response to the drug.

31704690|t|Absence of Islet Autoantibodies and Modestly Raised Glucose Values at Diabetes Diagnosis Should Lead to Testing for MODY: Lessons From a 5-Year Pediatric Swedish National Cohort Study.
31704690|a|OBJECTIVE: Identifying maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in pediatric populations close to diabetes diagnosis is difficult. Misdiagnosis and unnecessary insulin treatment are common. We aimed to identify the discriminatory clinical features at diabetes diagnosis of patients with glucokinase (GCK), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A (HNF1A), and HNF4A MODY in the pediatric population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Swedish patients (n = 3,933) aged 1-18 years, diagnosed with diabetes May 2005 to December 2010 were recruited from the national consecutive prospective cohort Better Diabetes Diagnosis. Clinical data, islet autoantibodies (GAD antibody, insulinoma antigen-2A, zinc transporter 8A, and IAA), HLA type, and C-peptide were collected at diagnosis. MODY was identified by sequencing GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A, either through routine clinical or research testing. RESULTS: The minimal prevalence of MODY was 1.2%. Discriminatory factors for MODY at diagnosis included four islet autoantibody negativity (100 vs. 11% not-known MODY; P = 2 x 10-44), HbA1c (7.0 vs. 10.7% [53 vs. 93 mmol/mol]; P = 1 x 10-20), plasma glucose (11.7 vs. 26.7 mmol/L; P = 3 x 10-19), parental diabetes (63 vs. 12%; P = 1 x 10-15), and diabetic ketoacidosis (0 vs. 15%; P = 0.001). Testing 303 autoantibody-negative patients identified 46 patients with MODY (detection rate 15%). Limiting testing to the 73 islet autoantibody-negative patients with HbA1c &lt;7.5% (58 mmol/mol) at diagnosis identified 36 out of 46 (78%) patients with MODY (detection rate 49%). On follow-up, the 46 patients with MODY had excellent glycemic control, with an HbA1c of 6.4% (47 mmol/mol), with 42 out of 46 (91%) patients not on insulin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis of pediatric diabetes, absence of all islet autoantibodies and modest hyperglycemia (HbA1c &lt;7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) should result in testing for GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A MODY. Testing all 12% patients negative for four islet autoantibodies is an effective strategy for not missing MODY but will result in a lower detection rate. Identifying MODY results in excellent long-term glycemic control without insulin.

31737858|t|Optimal Glycemic Control in a Patient With HNF1A MODY With GLP-1 RA Monotherapy: Implications for Future Therapy.
31737858|a|We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for &gt;12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY.

31739614|t|Human iPSCs-Derived Endothelial Cells with Mutation in HNF1A as a Model of Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young.
31739614|a|Patients with HNF1A-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) often develop endothelial dysfunction and related microvascular complications, like retinopathy. As the clinical phenotype of HNF1A-MODY diabetes varies considerably, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from two healthy individuals (control) to generate isogenic lines with mutation in HNF1A gene. Subsequently, control hiPSCs and their respective HNF1A clones were differentiated toward endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) and different markers/functions were compared. Human iPSC-ECs from all cell lines showed similar expression of CD31 and Tie-2. VE-cadherin expression was lower in HNF1A-mutated isogenic lines, but only in clones derived from one control hiPSCs. In the other isogenic set and cells derived from HNF1A-MODY patients, no difference in VE-cadherin expression was observed, suggesting the impact of the genetic background on this endothelial marker. All tested hiPSC-ECs showed an expected angiogenic response regardless of the mutation introduced. Isogenic hiPSC-ECs responded similarly to stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- with the increase in ICAM-1 and permeability, however, HNF1A mutated hiPSC-ECs showed higher permeability in comparison to the control cells. Summarizing, both mono- and biallelic mutations of HNF1A in hiPSC-ECs lead to increased permeability in response to TNF- in normal glycemic conditions, which may have relevance to HNF1A-MODY microvascular complications.

31754975|t|Primary hepatocellular adenoma due to biallelic HNF1A mutations and its co-occurrence with MODY 3: case-report and review of the literature.
31754975|a|PURPOSE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY 3) is a consequence of heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1A, and a subtype of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is caused by biallelic somatic HNF1A mutations; rare HCA may be related to MODY 3. This study aimed to investigate the cosegregation of HNF1A mutations with diabetes and HCA in two families. METHODS: Two patients suffering from HCA and diabetes were screened for HNF1A germline and somatic mutations using direct sequence analysis and methylation-specific multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) assay. Further, we screened eight relatives in the two independent families for diabetes, HCA and HNF1A variants. Additionally, we reviewed the literature concerning the phenotypes of MODY 3 and HCA at the background of HNF1A mutations. RESULTS: Here we reported two families (a total of six relatives) with two missense germline mutations of HNF1A identified initially using direct sequence analysis (c.686G&gt;A in family A and c.526 + 1G&gt;A in family B). Somatic deletion of the second allele of HNF1A was found in liver tumor tissues in both probands who were diagnosed with HCA. There are a total of ten cases of both MODY 3 and HCA phenotypes reported in the literature to date; incomplete penetrance for HCA was observed, and all the patients with HCA developed diabetes. The onset of diabetes and HCA was highly variable, the treatment of diabetes varied from diet to insulin, and the clinical expression of HCA ranged from silent to hemorrhage. Further, the severity of diabetes mellitus was not related to the occurrence of HCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the association of HCA and MODY 3 at the background of HNF1A mutations and highlights the importance of screening for HCA in MODY 3 families to avoid the possibility of severe complications. Further, the current study indicated that there may be a special mutational spectrum of HNF1A correlated with HCA in MODY 3 families.

31825269|t|HNF1A gene p.I27L is associated with co-existing preeclampsia in gestational diabetes mellitus.
31825269|a|The association of the FTO gene and HNF1alpha gene on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia remains unclear. This is the first study to examine whether HNF1alpha gene and FTO gene were associated with having GDM and preeclampsia in Turkish women. Healthy pregnant women (n = 101) and women with GDM (n = 169) were included. GDM was divided into two groups as GDM-only (n = 90) and GDM-preeclampsia (n = 79). Genotyping of HNF1alpha gene p.I27L, p.A98V, and p.S487N, and FTO gene rs9939609 SNPs were performed using RT-PCR. The frequency of p.S487N, p.A98V, and FTO genotype were similar between the groups (p > .05). p.I27L GG-wild, GT, and TT genotype were 56.5%, 36.6%, and 6.9% in controls; 40.0%, 51.1%, and 8.9% in GDM-only; and 26.6%, 51.9%, and 21.5% in GDM-preeclampsia (p = .034). TT and GT genotype was more frequent in GDM-preeclampsia than in controls (p < .05). GT genotype was increased in GDM-only compared with controls (p < .05). TT genotype was more frequent in GDM-preeclampsia than in GDM-only (p < .05). p.I27L TT genotype was independently associated with increased blood pressure (BP) and urinary protein. p.I27L TT genotype was associated with increased preeclampsia risk in patients with GDM by increasing BP and urinary protein.

31844173|t|Response to multiple glucose-lowering agents in a sib-pair with a novel HNF1alpha (MODY3) variant.
31844173|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by early onset, lean, non-autoimmunity mediated, non-insulin-dependent diabetes often with autosomal-dominant inheritance and specific pharmaco-genetic response. We describe two siblings with HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) due to a novel germline variant p.(His126Asp) which segregates with diabetes in the family. However, contrary to anticipated therapeutic response, blood glucose in this sib-pair did not respond to sulphonylureas (both low and high dose), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), also known as incretin mimetics. The unexpected limited pharmaco-therapeutic response could potentially be unique to this specific variant and/or progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure associated with long-standing disease duration, higher BMI and glucose-toxicity. Therefore, we report a novel-variant MODY3 sib-pair with atypical pharmaco-therapeutic response i.e. resistant to multiple anti-diabetes agents namely sulphonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RA treatment.

31968686|t|Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) in Portugal: Novel GCK, HNFA1 and HNFA4 Mutations.
31968686|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a frequently misdiagnosed type of diabetes, which is characterized by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance, and absence of insulin dependence. The most frequent subtypes are due to mutations of the GCK (MODY 2), HNF1A (MODY 3), and HNF4A (MODY 1) genes. We undertook the first multicenter genetic study of MODY in the Portuguese population. The GCK, HNF1A, and HNF4A genes were sequenced in 46 unrelated patients that had at least two of the three classical clinical criteria for MODY (age at diagnosis, family history, and clinical presentation). The functional consequences of the mutations were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Mutations were identified in 23 (50%) families. Twelve families had mutations in the GCK gene, eight in the HNF1A gene, and three in the HNF4A gene. These included seven novel mutations (GCK c.494T>C, GCK c.563C>G, HNF1A c.1623G>A, HNF1A c.1729C>G, HNF4A c.68delG, HNF4A c.422G>C, HNF4A c.602A>C). Mutation-positive patients were younger at the time of diagnosis when compared to mutation-negative patients (14.3 vs. 23.0 years, p = 0.011). This study further expands the spectrum of known mutations associated with MODY, and may contribute to a better understanding of this type of diabetes and a more personalized clinical management of affected individuals.

32001615|t|Homozygous Hypomorphic HNF1A Alleles Are a Novel Cause of Young-Onset Diabetes and Result in Sulphonylurea-Sensitive Diabetes.
32001615|a|OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in HNF1A cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Affected individuals can be treated with low-dose sulphonylureas. Individuals with homozygous HNF1A mutations causing MODY have not been reported. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We phenotyped a kindred with young-onset diabetes and performed molecular genetic testing, a mixed meal tolerance test, a sulphonylurea challenge, and in vitro assays to assess variant protein function. RESULTS: A homozygous HNF1A variant (p.A251T) was identified in three insulin-treated family members diagnosed with diabetes before 20 years of age. Those with the homozygous variant had low hs-CRP levels (0.2-0.8 mg/L), and those tested demonstrated sensitivity to sulphonylurea given at a low dose, completely transitioning off insulin. In silico modeling predicted a variant of unknown significance; however, in vitro studies supported a modest reduction in transactivation potential (79% of that for the wild type; P &lt; 0.05) in the absence of endogenous HNF1A. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous hypomorphic HNF1A variants are a cause of HNF1A-MODY. We thus expand the allelic spectrum of variants in dominant genes causing diabetes.

32017842|t|Functional analyses of HNF1A-MODY variants refine the interpretation of identified sequence variants.
32017842|a|CONTEXT: While rare variants of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) gene can cause Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY), other variants can be risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes. As has been suggested by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines for variant interpretation, functional studies provide strong evidence to classify a variant as pathogenic. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a functional evaluation can improve the interpretation of the HNF1A variants in our Czech MODY Registry. DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 17 HNF1A variants that were identified in 48 individuals (33 females/15 males) from 20 Czech families with diabetes by bioinformatics in silico tools and functional protein analyses (transactivation, protein expression, DNA binding, and nuclear localization). RESULTS: Of the 17 variants, 12 variants (p.Lys120Glu, p.Gln130Glu, p.Arg131Pro, p.Leu139Pro, p.Met154Ile, p.Gln170Ter, p.Glu187SerfsTer40, p.Phe215SerfsTer18, p.Gly253Arg, p.Leu383ArgfsTer3, p.Gly437Val, and p.Thr563HisfsTer85) exhibited significantly reduced transcriptional activity or DNA binding (&lt;40%) and were classified as (likely) pathogenic, 2/17 variants were (likely) benign and 3/17 remained of uncertain significance. Functional analyses allowed for the reclassification of 10/17 variants (59%). Diabetes treatment was improved in 20/29 (69%) carriers of (likely) pathogenic HNF1A variants. CONCLUSION: Functional evaluation of the HNF1A variants is necessary to better predict the pathogenic effects and to improve the diagnostic interpretation and treatment, particularly in cases where the co-segregation or family history data are not available or where the phenotype is more diverse and overlaps with other types of diabetes.

32086287|t|Systematic Genetic Study of Diabetic Youth in a Single Country Reveals the Prevalence of Diabetes Subtypes, Novel Candidate Genes, and Response to Precision Therapy.
32086287|a|Identifying gene variants causing monogenic diabetes increases understanding of disease etiology and allows for implementation of precision therapy to improve metabolic control and quality of life. Here, we aimed to assess the prevalence of monogenic diabetes in diabetic youth in Lithuania, uncover potential diabetes-related gene variants, and prospectively introduce precision treatment. First, we assessed all pediatric and most young adult diabetic patients in Lithuania (n = 1209) for diabetes-related autoimmune antibodies. We then screened all antibody-negative patients using targeted high-throughput sequencing of more than 300 potential candidate genes. In this group, 40.7% had monogenic diabetes, with the highest percentage (100%) in infants (diagnosis at ages 0-12 months), followed by those diagnosed at ages &gt;1-18 years (40.3%) and at &gt;18-25 years (22.2%). The overall prevalence of monogenic diabetes in diabetic youth in Lithuania was 3.5% (1.9% for GCK diabetes, 0.7% for HNF1A, 0.2% for HNF4A and ABCC8, 0.3% for KCNJ11, and 0.1% for INS). Furthermore, we identified likely pathogenic variants in 11 additional genes. Microvascular complications were present in 26% of those with monogenic diabetes. Prospective treatment change was successful in over 50% of eligible candidates, with C-peptide over 252 pmol/L emerging as the best prognostic factor.

32154941|t|HNF1A recruits KDM6A to activate differentiated acinar cell programs that suppress pancreatic cancer.
32154941|a|Defects in transcriptional regulators of pancreatic exocrine differentiation have been implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The locus encoding the transcription factor HNF1A harbors susceptibility variants for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), while KDM6A, encoding Lysine-specific demethylase 6A, carries somatic mutations in PDAC. Here, we show that pancreas-specific Hnf1a null mutant transcriptomes phenocopy those of Kdm6a mutations, and both defects synergize with KrasG12D to cause PDAC with sarcomatoid features. We combine genetic, epigenomic, and biochemical studies to show that HNF1A recruits KDM6A to genomic binding sites in pancreatic acinar cells. This remodels the acinar enhancer landscape, activates differentiated acinar cell programs, and indirectly suppresses oncogenic and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes. We also identify a subset of non-classical PDAC samples that exhibit the HNF1A/KDM6A-deficient molecular phenotype. These findings provide direct genetic evidence that HNF1A deficiency promotes PDAC. They also connect the tumor-suppressive role of KDM6A deficiency with a cell-specific molecular mechanism that underlies PDAC subtype definition.

32161757|t|In vivo Environment Swiftly Restricts Human Pancreatic Progenitors Toward Mono-Hormonal Identity via a HNF1A/HNF4A Mechanism.
32161757|a|Generating insulin-producing beta-cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells is a promising cell replacement therapy for improving or curing insulin-dependent diabetes. The transplantation of end-stages differentiating cells into living hosts was demonstrated to improve beta-cell maturation. Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms outlining the transplanted cells' response to the in vivo environment are still to be properly characterized. Here we use global proteomics and large-scale imaging techniques to demultiplex and filter the cellular processes and molecular signatures modulated by the immediate in vivo effect. We show that in vivo exposure swiftly confines in vitro generated human pancreatic progenitors to single hormone expression. The global proteome landscape of the transplanted cells was closer to native human islets, especially in regard to energy metabolism and redox balance. Moreover, our study indicates a possible link between these processes and certain epigenetic regulators involved in cell identity. Pathway analysis predicted HNF1A and HNF4A as key regulators controlling the in vivo islet-promoting response, with experimental evidence suggesting their involvement in confining islet cell fate following xeno-transplantation.

32162750|t|Patient perspectives on the diagnostic journey to a monogenic diabetes diagnosis: Barriers and facilitators.
32162750|a|Most monogenic diabetes is misdiagnosed as either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D/T2D). Few studies have examined the diagnostic challenges from the patients' perspective. This qualitative study aimed to investigate patients' journeys to obtaining a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) by elucidating the range of factors that can act as barriers and facilitators throughout this process. We recruited participants from the Personalized Diabetes Medicine Program (PDMP) at University of Maryland and used respondent-driven sampling to recruit additional patients. We conducted qualitative phone interviews between October 2016 and June 2017 with nine patients with diagnoses of monogenic diabetes (one HNF4A-MODY, seven GCK-MODY, and one HNF1A-MODY) and one parent of a patient with INS-MODY. Interview data were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed both inductively and deductively using thematic content analysis. All patients were female, with a mean age of 35 (range: 7-67 years). The amount of time these patients were misdiagnosed ranged from a few months to 41 years. We identified barriers and facilitators in three broad themes: (a) patient-related (nature of MODY symptoms, perceived test utility, individual personality); (b) provider-related (provider awareness and knowledge, provider communication); and (c) healthcare system-related (cost of testing, access to knowledgeable providers, patient education, and support resources). The diverse range of barriers and facilitators reiterates the complexity of the MODY diagnostic process. Limited awareness and knowledge of MODY from healthcare professionals and patients themselves account for most diagnostic delays described in this study. Efforts to promote awareness of MODY and expand access to screening and testing may result in quicker diagnosis and ensure the downstream benefits of proper treatment.

32238361|t|New clinical screening strategy to distinguish HNF1A variant-induced diabetes from young early-onset type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population.
32238361|a|OBJECTIVE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young caused by hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) variants (HNF1A-MODY) is a common form of monogenetic diabetes. Although patients with HNF1A-MODY might specifically benefit from sulfonylurea treatment, available methods for screening this specific type of diabetes are not cost-effective. This study was designed to establish an optimized clinical strategy based on multiple biomarkers to distinguish patients with HNF1A-MODY from clinically diagnosed early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOD) for genetic testing in a Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-control study including 125 non-related young patients with EOD and 15 probands with HNF1A-MODY (cohort 1) was conducted to evaluate reported biomarkers for HNF1A-MODY. A cut-off for the fasting insulin (Fins) level, the 97.5 percentile of 150 healthy subjects with normal components of metabolic syndrome (cohort 2), was used to filter out individuals with obvious insulin resistance (Fins <102 pmol/L). An optimized clinical screening strategy (HNF1A-CSS) was established, and its effectiveness was assessed in another group of 410 young patients with EOD (cohort 3). RESULTS: In cohort 1, body mass index (BMI), serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were confirmed to be useful for the differential diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY. In cohort 3, eight probands with HNF1A-MODY were identified. In cohort 3 and young relatives with HNF1A-MODY, meeting three of four criteria (BMI <28 kg/m2, hs-CRP <0.75 mg/L, Fins <102 pmol/L and HDL-c >1.12 mmol/L), the sensitivity and specificity of HNF1A-CSS were 100% and 69.3%, respectively. In the pooled analysis of all young patients, HNF1A-CSS displayed 90.5% sensitivity and 73.6% specificity for identifying patients with HNF1A-MODY among those with clinically diagnosed EOD. CONCLUSION: Our HNF1A-CSS is useful for distinguishing patients with HNF1A-MODY from patients with EOD in a young Chinese population.
