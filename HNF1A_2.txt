11713231|t|Beta-cell-targeted expression of a dominant-negative hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha induces a maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)3-like phenotype in transgenic mice.
11713231|a|Mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3, a severe form of diabetes characterized by pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. We have used targeted expression of a dominant-negative mutant of HNF-1 alpha to specifically suppress HNF-1 alpha function in beta-cells of transgenic mice. We show that males expressing the mutant protein became overtly diabetic within 6 wk of age, whereas females displayed glucose intolerance. Transgenic males exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, detected both in vivo and in the perfused pancreas. Pancreatic insulin content was markedly decreased in diabetic animals, whereas the glucagon content was increased. Postnatal islet development was altered, with an increased alpha-cell to beta-cell ratio. beta-Cell ultrastructure showed signs of severe beta-cell damage, including mitochondrial swelling. This animal model of maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 should be useful for the further elucidation of the mechanism by which HNF-1 alpha deficiency causes beta-cell dysfunction in this disease.

11717395|t|A transcription factor regulatory circuit in differentiated pancreatic cells.
11717395|a|Mutations in the human genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) 1alpha, 1beta, 4alpha, and IPF1(PDX1/IDX1/STF1) result in pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. In hepatocytes, hnf4alpha controls the transcription of hnf1alpha, suggesting that this same interaction may operate in beta cells and thus account for the common diabetic phenotype. We show that, in pancreatic islet and exocrine cells, hnf4alpha expression unexpectedly depends on hnf1alpha. This effect is tissue-specific and mediated through direct occupation by hnf1alpha of an alternate promoter located 45.6 kb from the previously characterized hnf4alpha promoter. Hnf1alpha also exerts direct control of pancreatic-specific expression of hnf4gamma and hnf3gamma. Hnf1alpha dependence of hnf4alpha, hnf4gamma, hnf3gamma, and two previously characterized distal targets (glut2 and pklr) is established only after differentiated cells arise during pancreatic embryonic development. These studies define an unexpected hierarchical regulatory relationship between two genes involved in human monogenic diabetes in the cells, which are relevant to its pathophysiology. Furthermore, they indicate that hnf1alpha is an essential component of a transcription factor circuit whose role may be to maintain differentiated functions of pancreatic cells.

11719843|t|MODY in Iceland is associated with mutations in HNF-1alpha and a novel mutation in NeuroD1.
11719843|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Five different types of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) have been identified until now but mutation screening suggests that more MODY genes exist. Mutations in genes encoding transcription factors essential for normal development and function of pancreatic beta cells has recently become important in studying the genetics of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Patients with MODY and their families in Iceland were screened for mutations in the transcription factor genes. METHODS: Clinical and biochemical information on individuals with MODY was collected and their family trees constructed. Linkage analysis was carried out on chromosomal regions known to harbour genes previously shown to be associated with MODY. Mutations were identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Three families were identified. Two of these showed linkage to chromosome 12 and carried mutations in exon 4 of the HNF-1alpha gene (290fsdelC and R272C). However, the third family showed no linkage to the previously described MODY genes but shared a novel mutation in the NeuroD1 gene on chromosome 2q32. This mutation, a glutamate to lysine substitution at codon 110, resides in the basic domain of the protein. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in MODY subjects have been identified in the Icelandic population. In addition this study identified the NeuroD1 gene as the gene responsible for the sixth type of MODY.

11724785|t|Dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1 alpha results in mitochondrial dysfunction, INS-1 cell apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to ceramide-, but not to high glucose-induced cell death.
11724785|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 3 is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha. We investigated the involvement of apoptotic events in INS-1 insulinoma cells overexpressing wild-type HNF-1 alpha (WT-HNF-1 alpha) or a dominant-negative mutant (DN-HNF-1 alpha) under control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional activator. Forty-eight h after induction of DN-HNF-1 alpha, INS-1 cells activated caspase-3 and underwent apoptotic cell death, while cells overexpressing WT-HNF-1 alpha remained viable. Mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 accompanied DN-HNF-1 alpha-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Activation of caspases was preceded by mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Transient overexpression of Bcl-xL was sufficient to rescue INS-1 cells from DN-HNF-1 alpha-induced apoptosis. Both WT- and DN-HNF-1 alpha-expressing cells demonstrated similar increases in apoptosis when cultured at high glucose (25 mm). In contrast, induction of DN-HNF-1 alpha highly sensitized cells to ceramide toxicity. In cells cultured at low glucose, DN-HNF-1 alpha induction also caused up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1). Therefore, our data indicate that increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and decreased cell proliferation may account for the progressive loss of beta-cell function seen in MODY 3 subjects.

11756330|t|Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant hepatocyte nuclear fctor-1 alpha in pancreatic beta-cells causes abnormal islet architecture with decreased expression of E-cadherin, reduced beta-cell proliferation, and diabetes.
11756330|a|One subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-3 results from mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha. We generated transgenic mice expressing a naturally occurring dominant-negative form of human HNF-1 alpha (P291fsinsC) in pancreatic beta-cells. A progressive hyperglycemia with age was seen in these transgenic mice, and the mice developed diabetes with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The pancreatic islets exhibited abnormal architecture with reduced expression of glucose transporter (GLUT2) and E-cadherin. Blockade of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in pancreatic islets abolished the glucose-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca(2+) levels and insulin secretion, suggesting that loss of E-cadherin in beta-cells is associated with impaired insulin secretion. There was also a reduction in beta-cell number (50%), proliferation rate (15%), and pancreatic insulin content (45%) in 2-day-old transgenic mice and a further reduction in 4-week-old animals. Our findings suggest various roles for HNF-1 alpha in normal glucose metabolism, including the regulation of glucose transport, beta-cell growth, and beta-cell-to-beta-cell communication.

11806470|t|Identification of a new mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in a Polish family with early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus.
11806470|a|Recently, several genes associated with early-onset, autosomal dominant Type 2 diabetes (MODY) have been identified. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene seem to account for a substantial proportion of this type of diabetes in several populations. However, it is still of interest to estimate the frequency of HNF-1alpha mutations in various ethnic groups. The aim of our study was to determine the contribution of the HNF-1alpha gene to the development of MODY in a Polish population. We selected 15 families with MODY for this project. The 10 exons and promoter region of the gene were screened for sequence differences by direct sequencing of probands DNA. We detected 7 previously described polymorphisms that were not associated with diabetes. However, one sequence difference, a deletion of a cytosine in codon 225 in exon 3 (designated S225fdelC), was a new mutation resulting in a frame shift and synthesis of a nonsense peptide from amino acid 225 to 232 followed by the stop codon. Thus, the S225fdelC mutation effectively caused the loss of a part of the DNA binding domain and the entire transactivation domain. This mutation was present in 4 affected members of the family. They developed diabetes at an early age (mean age at diagnosis 23 yr) and were characterized by severely impaired insulin secretion. In addition, one family member who was not a carrier of the S225fdelC mutation was diagnosed with diabetes. Thus, he represents an example of phenocopy. In conclusion, we have identified a new HNF-1alpha variant that represents the first MODY mutation described in a Polish population. MODY3 mutations, including those in the exon 4 "hot spot", do not appear to be a very common cause of MODY in the Polish population.

11827432|t|Mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha is not a common cause of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes in Korea.
11827432|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-3 with a mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha has been identified in most races, but the prevalence of Korean MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes with a mutation in this gene is unknown. To determine the prevalence of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes with the mutation of HNF-1alpha gene in Korea, we analyzed this gene in 69 Korean early-onset type 2 diabetics and in 35 healthy persons using the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique and direct sequencing. We identified one mutation in exon 4 (C900A) in only one of the 69 Korean subjects with early-onset type 2 diabetes; this mutation was silent and did not change the amino acid (Pro300). Additionally, we identified four polymorphisms: S487N, AAC--&gt;AGC, intron 2 (nt -23), intron 7: (nt +7) and intron 9 (nt -24). However, there was no significant difference in frequencies of the four polymorphisms between the type 2 diabetes and control groups. Among type 2 diabetics, codon 487 variant showed no relationship to age at onset, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, basal C-peptide and 2 hour C-peptide. We concluded that this genetic mutation in HNF-1alpha gene may not be a common contributor to MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes susceptibility in Korea.

11904371|t|HNF-1alpha G319S, a transactivation-deficient mutant, is associated with altered dynamics of diabetes onset in an Oji-Cree community.
11904371|a|The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Oji-Cree of northwestern Ontario is the third highest in the world. A private mutation, G319S, in HNF1A, which encodes hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), was associated with Oji-Cree type 2 diabetes and was found in approximately 40% of affected subjects. The G319S mutation reduced the in vitro ability of HNF-1alpha to activate transcription by approximately 50%, with no effect on DNA binding or protein stability. There was no evidence of a dominant negative effect of the mutant protein. The impact of the G319S mutation at the population level was assessed by classifying subjects with type 2 diabetes according to HNF1A genotype and plotting the cumulative age of onset of diabetes. Disease onset was modeled satisfactorily by two-parameter sigmoidal functions for all diabetic subjects and all three HNF1A genotypes. Pairwise statistical comparisons showed significant between-genotype differences in t50 (all P &lt; 0.00001), corresponding to the age at which half the subjects had become diabetic. Each dose of G319S accelerated median disease onset by approximately 7 years. Thus, the transactivation-deficient HNF1A G319S mutation affects the dynamics of disease onset. The demonstration of a functional consequence for HNF1A G319S provides a mechanistic basis for its strong association with Oji-Cree type 2 diabetes and its unparalleled specificity for diabetes prediction in these people, in whom diabetes presents a significant public health dilemma. The findings also show that HNF1A mutations can be associated with typical adult-onset insulin-resistant obesity-related diabetes in addition to maturity-onset diabetes of the young.

11938027|t|Prevalence of the missense mutation Gly574Ser in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha in Africans with diabetes.
11938027|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical presentation and natural history of diabetes are somewhat different in Black Africans compared to Caucasians. This peculiar disease course could be at least partly related to a specific genetic profile that has not been studied in this population. METHODS: Medical backgrounds, anthropometric and biologic parameters were obtained from 69 diabetic subjects in Dakar, Senegal, in 1998. Blood anti GAD and Islet Cell Antibodies were studied, using RIA and immunofluorescence assay. The HNF-1alpha gene was sequenced searching the Gly574Ser mutation, previously described in MODY 3. RESULTS: Among these 69 diabetic patients, 11 (16%) were found to have the G574S mutation affecting the HNF-1alpha. These 11 patients carrying the mutation were compared respectively with the 58 non carriers. Mean age (57.5 yr. +/- 11 vs 51.1 yr. +/- 15) and duration of diabetes (11.9 vs 6.7 yr), were similar in the two groups. BMI was not different in patients with the mutation (26.3 vs 23.3, p=0.06). Metabolic control (Glycosylated hemoglobin) was poor in the two groups (9.5% vs 9.2%). Chronic complications were equally found in the patients, but no mutation carrier had macroangiopathy. None of the anti GAD positive or ICA positive patients had the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The HNF-1alpha Gly574Ser mutation was found in 16% of cases in a 69 diabetic patients group in Senegal. Diabetes was as severe as in non carriers of mutation. This mutation has been implicated in atypical diabetes of Afro-American children. The study confirms its prevalence in Africans with diabetes.

11978637|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha recruits the transcriptional co-activator p300 on the GLUT2 gene promoter.
11978637|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene have been linked to subtype 3 of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a disease characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion. Here we show that the human GLUT2 gene is closely regulated by HNF-1alpha via sequences downstream of the transcriptional start site by interaction with transcriptional co-activator p300. The promoter region of the human GLUT2 gene was subcloned into luciferase expression plasmids that were transfected together with HNF-1alpha expression plasmid into a pancreatic beta-cell line, HIT-T15, to evaluate transcriptional activities. HNF-1alpha enhanced human GLUT2 promoter activity sixfold. Site-direct mutagenesis and footprint analyses showed that the HNF-1alpha binding site (+200 to +218) is critical in human GLUT2 gene expression. Furthermore, mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation studies revealed the transactivation domain of HNF-1alpha (amino acids 391-540) to interact with both the NH(2)-terminal region (amino acids 180-662) and the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 1,818-2,079) of p300. These findings demonstrated that HNF-1alpha binds to the 5'-untranslated region of GLUT2 and that p300 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for HNF-1alpha. In addition, these results provided new insight into the regulatory function of HNF-1alpha by suggesting a molecular basis for human GLUT2 gene expression.

12031966|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha modulates pancreatic beta-cell growth by regulating the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 in INS-1 cells.
12031966|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is characterized by impaired insulin secretion. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha are the cause of MODY3. Transgenic mice overexpressing dominant-negative HNF-1alpha mutant in pancreatic beta-cells and HNF-1alpha knockout mice are animal models of MODY3. These mice exhibit defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and have reduced beta-cell mass and beta-cell proliferation rate. Here we examined the effect of HNF-1alpha on beta-cell proliferation by overexpressing a human naturally occurring dominant- negative mutation P291fsinsC in INS-1 cells under the control of doxycycline-induction system. INS-1 cells overexpressing P291fsinsC showed apparent growth impairment. The proliferation rate estimated by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced in P291fsinsC-expressing INS-1 cells compared with noninduced or wild-type HNF-1alpha-overexpressing INS-1 cells. Growth inhibition occurred at the transition from G1 to S cell cycle phase, with reduced expression of cyclin E and upregulation of p27. cDNA array analysis revealed that the expression levels of IGF-1, a major growth factor for beta-cells, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, were reduced in P291fsinsC-HNF-1alpha-expressing INS-1 cells. Although MIF seemed to have proliferative function, blockade of MIF action by anti-MIF antibody stimulated INS-1 cell proliferation, excluding its direct role in the growth impairment. However, addition of IGF-1 to P291fsinsC-expressing INS-1 cells rescued the growth inhibition. Our data suggest that HNF-1alpha is critical for modulating pancreatic beta-cell growth by regulating IGF-1 expression. IGF-1 might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MODY3.

12050210|t|Nine novel mutations in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) candidate genes in 22 Spanish families.
12050210|a|The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of major maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) subtypes in Spanish MODY families and to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations. Twenty-two unrelated pediatric MODY patients and 97 relatives were screened for mutations in the coding region of the glucokinase (GCK), hepatic nuclear factor- HNF-1alpha and HNF4alpha genes using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and/or direct sequencing. In families carrying GCK mutations, the influence of genetic defects on fetal growth was investigated by comparing the birth weights of 32 offspring discordant for the mutations. Mutations in MODY genes were identified in 64% of the families. GCK/MODY2 mutations were the most frequently found, in 41%: seven novel (R369P, S411F, M298K, C252Y, Y108C, A188E, and S383L) and 2 already described mutations. Four pedigrees (18%) harbored mutations in the HNF-1alpha/MODY3 gene, including a previously unreported change (R271G). One family (4%) carried a novel mutation in the HNF-4alpha gene (IVS5-2delA), representing the first report of a MODY1 pedigree in the Spanish population. The age at diagnosis was prepubertal in MODY2 index patients and pubertal in MODY3 patients. Overt diabetes was rare in MODY2 and was invariably present in MODY3 index patients. Chronic complications of diabetes were absent in the MODY2 population and were present in more than 40% of all relatives of MODY3. Birth weight was lower in the presence of a GCK fetal mutation when the mutation was of paternal origin. The MODY1 patient was diagnosed at 15 yr of age. She developed intermittent microalbuminuria despite good metabolic control, and severe late-onset complications were common within her family. Mutations in the GCK/MODY2 gene are the most common cause of MODY in our population as recruited from pediatric and adolescent index patients. The inheritance of GCK defects by the fetus results in a reduction of birth weight. Clinical expression of MODY3 and MODY1 mutations, the second and third groups of defects found, was more severe, including the frequent development of chronic complications.

12107757|t|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Chinese MODY families: prevalence and functional analysis.
12107757|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterised by an early age of onset (usually &lt;25 years). We investigated the prevalence and trans-activating activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) -1 alpha mutations in southern Chinese families with MODY. METHODS: We screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in 50 unrelated southern Chinese families, which fulfilled the minimum criteria for MODY. Functional properties of the mutant proteins were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Five of the 50 (10%) families were found to have mutations in the coding region, including a new nonsense mutation Q176X and four reported mutations (frameshift mutation P379fsdelCT, nonsense mutation R171X, missense mutations G20R and P112L). These mutations had decreased trans-activating activity on the human insulin gene promoter. We also detected a new intronic sequence variation IVS7nt-6 G--&gt;A, which co-segregated with diabetes. The intronic variation creates a potential splice acceptor site and might alter the splicing of the HNF-1 alpha mRNA. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene seem to be an important cause of MODY in southern Chinese. The mutations could affect normal islet function by altering the expression of target genes.

12145145|t|A genetic switch in pancreatic beta-cells: implications for differentiation and haploinsufficiency.
12145145|a|Heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding transcriptional regulators hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha cause a form of diabetes known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Haploinsufficiency of HNF-1alpha or HNF-4alpha results in MODY because of defective function of pancreatic islet cells. In contrast, homozygous null mutations in mouse models lead to widespread and profound gene expression defects in multiple cell types. Thus, it is not surprising that HNF-1alpha function is now known to have distinct properties in pancreatic beta-cells. It controls a complex tissue-selective genetic network that is activated when pancreatic cells differentiate, and allows these cells to maintain critical specialized functions. The network contains an indispensable core component formed by a positive cross-regulatory feedback circuit between HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha. This type of circuit configuration can exhibit a switch-like behavior with two stable states. In the default active state, it can serve to perpetuate network activity in differentiated beta-cells. However, the loss of one HNF-1alpha or HNF-4alpha allele can increase the probability that the feedback circuit is permanently switched off, resulting in decreased expression of all four alleles selectively in beta-cells. Such a model can serve to rationalize key aspects of the pathogenic mechanism in MODY.

12173691|t|Different genes, different diabetes: lessons from maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
12173691|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetic subgroup of diabetes characterised by an autosomal dominant inheritance and early onset, non-insulin dependent diabetes. This results from a monogenic defect causing beta-cell dysfunction. The defining of five genes in which mutations cause MODY has allowed us to understand the clinical heterogeneity seen in this condition and can guide clinical management. Mutations in the glucokinase gene lead to stable hyperglycaemia, complications are unusual and treatment is rarely needed. Glucokinase patients are often detected during screening in pregnancy. While maternal mutations increase birth weight by increasing maternal glycaemia, fetal mutations reduce birth weight by reducing fetal insulin secretion. Patients with mutation in genes encoding the transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)- 1alpha, HNF-4alpha, HNF-1beta and insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF-1) have a common progressive beta-cell failure resulting in increasing hyperglycaemia and treatment requirements. These patients are at risk of developing microvascular complications. They show a pharmacogenetic effect with a specific sensitivity to sulphonylureas. Patients with transcription factor mutations have a range of discrete extra-pancreatic phenotypes including a low renal threshold for glucose with HNF-1alpha mutations, altered lipids and lipoproteins with HNF-4alpha mutations and a variety of cystic renal diseases and uterine and genital developmental disorders with HNF-1beta mutations. Molecular genetic testing is now available in routine clinical practice. This allows confirmation of a diagnosis of MODYand defines the subgroup. Differences in prognosis and treatment strongly support the increased use of molecular genetic testing in diabetes.

12207813|t|Heterogeneity in young adult onset diabetes: aetiology alters clinical characteristics.
12207813|a|AIMS: To describe the characteristics of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1 alpha mutation carriers diagnosed with diabetes after 25 years and compare them with young-onset Type 2 diabetic patients (YT2D) diagnosed at the same age. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 44 (21 male, 23 female) patients with HNF-1 alpha mutations diagnosed with diabetes at ages 25-45 years and 44 YT2D subjects matched for sex and age of diagnosis. RESULTS: Median age of onset of diabetes was 35 years in both groups. The HNF-1 alpha group demonstrated: lower body mass index (25.1 vs. 30.7 kg/m2; P &lt; 0.001) and lower fasting triglycerides (1.37 vs. 2.96 mmol/l; P = 0.001) with similar fasting cholesterol level. They had lower glycated haemoglobin A1c (7.3 vs. 8.5%; P = 0.015) despite greater duration of diabetes (24 vs. 16 years; P = 0.02) and less frequent treatment with insulin (21% vs. 55%; P = 0.002). They were less likely to be treated for hypertension (13.3% vs. 56.3%; P = 0.009). Importantly, no difference was observed in reported parental history of diabetes between the two groups (65.9% vs. 63.6%; P = 0.92). Logistic regression showed that triglyceride levels and presence of anti-hypertensive treatment were the most important independent variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HNF-1 alpha mutations may present with diabetes as young adults between the ages of 25-45 years. In this age range a wide differential diagnosis of diabetes is observed. Conventional criteria of age of onset and family history will not differentiate HNF-1 alpha mutation carriers from YT2D subjects in this age range, but features of the metabolic syndrome, in particular fasting triglycerides and hypertension, are helpful. In patients diagnosed before 45 years without features of insulin resistance the diagnosis of HNF-1 alpha should be considered.

12235114|t|Genetic evidence that HNF-1alpha-dependent transcriptional control of HNF-4alpha is essential for human pancreatic beta cell function.
12235114|a|Mutations in the genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) and HNF-1alpha impair insulin secretion and cause maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). HNF-4alpha is known to be an essential positive regulator of HNF-1alpha. More recent data demonstrates that HNF-4alpha expression is dependent on HNF-1alpha in mouse pancreatic islets and exocrine cells. This effect is mediated by binding of HNF-1alpha to a tissue-specific promoter (P2) located 45.6 kb upstream from the previously characterized Hnf4alpha promoter (P1). Here we report that the expression of HNF-4alpha in human islets and exocrine cells is primarily mediated by the P2 promoter. Furthermore, we describe a G --&gt; A mutation in a conserved nucleotide position of the HNF-1alpha binding site of the P2 promoter, which cosegregates with MODY. The mutation results in decreased affinity for HNF-1alpha, and consequently in reduced HNF-1alpha-dependent activation. These findings provide genetic evidence that HNF-1alpha serves as an upstream regulator of HNF-4alpha and interacts directly with the P2 promoter in human pancreatic cells. Furthermore, they indicate that this regulation is essential to maintain normal pancreatic function.

12355088|t|Bi-allelic inactivation of TCF1 in hepatic adenomas.
12355088|a|Liver adenomas are benign tumors at risk of malignant transformation. In a genome-wide search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with liver adenomas, we found a deletion in chromosome 12q in five of ten adenomas. In most cases, LOH at 12q was the only recurrent genetic alteration observed, suggesting the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene in that region. A minimal common region of deletion was defined in 12q24 that included the gene TCF1 (transcription factor 1), encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1; refs 1,2). Heterozygous germline mutations of TCF1 have been identified in individuals affected with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3; ref. 3). Bi-allelic inactivation of TCF1 was found in 10 of 16 screened adenomas, and heterozygous germline mutation were present in three affected individuals. Furthermore, 2 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) occurring in normal liver contained somatic bi-allelic mutations of 30 screened HCCs. These results indicate that inactivation of TCF1, whether sporadic or associated with MODY3, is an important genetic event in the occurrence of human liver adenoma, and may be an early step in the development of some HCCs.

12359128|t|The role of transcription factors in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
12359128|a|The study of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant form of early-onset diabetes mellitus characterised by defective insulin secretion has been extremely successful in two ways. Firstly it has enabled definitive diagnosis for patients. This allows more accurate prediction of disease and treatment requirements. Secondly it has facilitated an increased understanding of the genes and pathways that are crucial for normal beta-cell function. Five of the six MODY genes, TCF1 (encoding HNF-1alpha), TCF2 (encoding HNF-1beta) HNF4A, insulin promoter factor (IPF)1, and NEUROD1, are transcription factors that operate in a complex network of gene regulation. Several genes have been shown to be regulated by the MODY transcription factors in a beta-cell specific manner. This includes the co-regulation of HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha by each other. The exact mechanism of how mutations in these transcription factors result in diabetes in humans remains unknown. However, current opinion favours pleiotropic adverse effects on many genes; extensive in vitro and in vivo studies of these genes has highlighted their importance in both glucose sensing-insulin secretion coupling and maintaining the fully differentiated beta-cell phenotype.

12378390|t|Abnormal splicing of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
12378390|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene result in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY); an early-onset, dominantly inherited form of diabetes caused by pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Splice site mutations represent approximately 10% of reported HNF-1 alpha mutations. No studies to date have investigated the effect of splice site mutations on mRNA processing because the tissues with abundant HNF-1alpha expression (liver, pancreas, kidney and gut) are not easily accessible for analysis. This study aimed to define the pathogenic mechanism in three novel splice site mutations by analysing illegitimate transcripts. METHODS: To assess the consequence of potential HNF-1 alpha splice site mutations we developed a nested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the amplification of illegitimate HNF-1 alpha transcripts in Epstein Barr virus transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. RESULTS: Sequencing the illegitimate HNF-1 alpha transcripts showed that the splice donor site mutation IVS8nt+1G&gt;A leads to complete skipping of exon 8, the splice acceptor site mutation IVS4nt-2A&gt;G causes skipping of exon 5 with the recruitment of a cryptic splice acceptor site within intron 5 and the cryptic splice acceptor site mutation (IVS7nt-6G&gt;A) resulted in the skipping of exon 7. All three changes are predicted to result in premature termination of the HNF-1alpha protein, providing further evidence for their role as pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the sequencing of illegitimate transcripts from lymphoblastoid cell lines is helpful in the assessment of intronic variation in HNF-1 alpha that could alter splicing. This analysis of the mRNA is required to define mutational mechanisms and confirm pathogenic status.

12442280|t|GCK and HNF1A mutations in Canadian families with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
12442280|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous form of type 2 diabetes that is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, onset in early adulthood and a primary defect in insulin secretion. Mutations in at least six genes have been shown to underlie MODY, including mutations in GCK (encoding glucokinase, also called MODY2) and mutations in HNF1A (encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha, also called MODY3). We sequenced genomic DNA from probands of seven Canadian MODY families. In four probands, we detected four novel GCK mutations, namely IVS2-7G&gt;A, G72R, T206R and S263P. In three other probands, we detected three HNF1A mutations, of which two were novel, namely 1051delCA and Q250X, and one had been previously reported, namely R131Q. The novel mutations expand the spectrum of MODY mutations. In addition, knowledge of the specific defect can be used to pre-symptomatically identify family members at risk for developing MODY.

12453420|t|Diabetes mutations delineate an atypical POU domain in HNF-1alpha.
12453420|a|Mutations in Hnf-1alpha are the most common Mendelian cause of diabetes mellitus. To elucidate the molecular function of a mutational hotspot, we cocrystallized human HNF-1alpha 83-279 with a high-affinity promoter and solved the structure of the complex. Two identical protein molecules are bound to the promoter. Each contains a homeodomain and a second domain structurally similar to POU-specific domains that was not predicted on the basis of amino acid sequence. Atypical elements in both domains create a stable interface that further distinguishes HNF-1alpha from other flexible POU-homeodomain proteins. The numerous diabetes-causing mutations in HNF-1alpha thus identified a previously unrecognized POU domain which was used as a search model to identify additional POU domain proteins in sequence databases.

12453961|t|The prevalence of the HNF-1alpha G319S mutation in Canadian aboriginal youth with type 2 diabetes.
12453961|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of the unique HNF-1alpha G319S mutation in a population of aboriginal youth with type 2 diabetes and to describe the relationship between clinical and historical characteristics and the presence or absence of the HNF-1alpha G319S mutation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participating youth were genotyped for the G319S mutation of the HNF-1alpha gene. Clinical, laboratory, and historical data were collected via chart review (blinded to genotype results). Comparison data were derived from another study involving young nondiabetic pregnant aboriginal women. RESULTS: A total of 51 youth seen sequentially in a type 2 diabetes clinic participated in this study. Of these, 21 (41.2%) had at least one copy of the mutant allele. The allele frequency in the study population was 0.29 (95% CI 0.20-0.38), which was significantly different from the allele frequency of 0.13 in the comparison population (chi(2) = 6.78, P = 0.009). The frequency of the homozygous mutation (S319/S319) was 0.18. Mean BMI was significantly lower (P = 0.002), mean HbA(1c) was significantly higher (P = 0.02), and acanthosis nigricans was significantly less frequent (P = 0.004) in those with the mutation compared with the wild type. Mean insulin levels were lower and insulin sensitivity (assessed by homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]) was greater in the homozygote group compared with the wild-type group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0007, respectively). A dose-dependent gradient was observed for these characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the association between the HNF-1alpha G319S mutation and early-onset type 2 diabetes in this population. Those with the mutation lacked clinical characteristics of insulin resistance (e.g., obesity and acanthosis nigricans) and had lower insulin levels, suggesting that an insulin-secretory and/or -production defect plays an important role in the development of diabetes in this group. Further investigation of the pathophysiology of the S319 homo- and heterozygote is needed because it may impact treatment and/or prevention of this disease.

12453975|t|Intrauterine hyperglycemia is associated with an earlier diagnosis of diabetes in HNF-1alpha gene mutation carriers.
12453975|a|OBJECTIVE: In animals, experimentally induced maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy results in hyperglycemic offspring. Similarly, Pima Indian offspring with mothers who are diabetic at the time of pregnancy have increased risk of early-onset diabetes. We hypothesized that exposure to hyperglycemia in utero would decrease the age at diagnosis of diabetes in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the affect of maternal diabetes on age at diagnosis of diabetes in 150 HNF-1alpha gene mutation carriers from 55 families. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis in HNF-1alpha mutation carriers was younger when the mother was diagnosed before pregnancy compared with when the mother was diagnosed after pregnancy (15.5 +/- 5.4 vs. 27.5 +/- 13.1 years, P &lt; 0.0001). This is unlikely to represent a generalized familial decrease in age at diagnosis due to a more severe mutation, because no difference was seen in age of the offspring at diagnosis of diabetes when the father was diagnosed at a young age, and a similar trend was seen when only the single common mutation, P291fsinsC, was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy probably increases the penetrance of HNF-1alpha mutations. The potential role of exposure to hyperglycemia in utero in a monogenic diabetic subgroup warrants prospective study.

12453976|t|Determinants of the development of diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3) in carriers of HNF-1alpha mutations: evidence for parent-of-origin effect.
12453976|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of the age at onset of diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3 [MODY3]) and to identify determinants of the onset of diabetes in carriers of HNF-1alpha mutations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Extended families (n = 104) with type 2 diabetes inherited in a dominant pattern were recruited and screened for diabetes-causing mutations in HNF-1alpha. RESULTS: HNF-1alpha mutations cosegregated with diabetes in only 13 families, all with a mean age at onset &lt;35 years. Insulin secretion was diminished or absent in mutation carriers (n = 101), and diabetes developed in 65% by age 25 years and in 100% by age 50 years. If the mutation was inherited from the mother, diabetes onset was very young in those exposed to diabetes in utero; 57 +/- 8% were affected by age 15 years as compared with 0.0% in those not exposed (P &lt; 7 x 10(-6)). By age 25 years, the difference was reduced (85 +/- 6 and 55 +/- 12%, respectively; P = 0.02). If the mutation was inherited from the father, diabetes developed in 52 +/- 8% by age 25 years. Age at diagnosis was shown to be highly heritable (h(2) = 0.47, P = 0.003). When parent of origin was included in the analyses, the magnitude of genetic contribution increased markedly (h(2) = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in HNF-1alpha accounts for diabetes in a small proportion of families with a dominant pattern of inheritance. Age at onset of diabetes in MODY3 families varied widely and was influenced by familial factors (including modifying genes) and parent of origin (whether a mutation carrier was exposed to diabetes in utero).

12475772|t|Experimental models of transcription factor-associated maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
12475772|a|Six monogenic forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) have been identified to date. Except for MODY2 (glucokinase), all other MODY subtypes have been linked to transcription factors. We have established a MODY3 transgenic model through the beta-cell-targeted expression of dominant-negative HNF-1alpha either constitutively (rat insulin II promoter) or conditionally (Tet-On system). The animals display either overt diabetes or glucose intolerance. Decreased insulin secretion and reduced pancreatic insulin content contribute to the hyperglycemic state. The conditional approach in INS-1 cells helped to define new molecular targets of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha. In the cellular system, nutrient-induced insulin secretion was abolished because of impaired glucose metabolism. Conditional suppression of HNF-4alpha, the MODY1 gene, showed a similar phenotype in INS-1 cells to HNF-1alpha. The existence of a regulatory circuit between HNF-4alpha and HNF-1alpha is confirmed in these cell models. The MODY4 gene, IPF-1 (insulin promoter factor-1)/PDX-1 (pancreas duodenum homeobox-1), controls not only the transcription of insulin but also expression of enzymes involved in its processing. Suppression of Pdx-1 function in INS-1 cells does not alter glucose metabolism but rather inhibits insulin release by impairing steps distal to the generation of mitochondrial coupling factors. The presented experimental models are important tools for the elucidation of the beta-cell pathogenesis in MODY syndromes.

12475773|t|Decreased glibenclamide uptake in hepatocytes of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha-deficient mice: a mechanism for hypersensitivity to sulfonylurea therapy in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (MODY3).
12475773|a|Diabetes in subjects with hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene mutations (maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY]-3) is characterized by impaired insulin secretion. Surprisingly, MODY3 patients exhibit hypersensitivity to the hypoglycemic actions of sulfonylurea therapy. To study the pharmacogenetic mechanism(s), we have investigated glibenclamide-induced insulin secretion, glibenclamide clearance from the blood, and glibenclamide metabolism in wild-type and Hnf-1alpha-deficient mice. We show that despite a profound defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, diabetic Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice have a robust glibenclamide-induced insulin secretory response. We demonstrate that the half-life (t(1/2)) of glibenclamide in the blood is increased in Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice compared with wild-type littermates (3.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.8 min, P &lt;or= 0.05). The clearance of glibenclamide from the blood during the first hours after intravenous administration was reduced approximately fourfold in Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice compared with Hnf-1alpha(+/+) littermates. Glibenclamide uptake into hepatocytes was dramatically decreased in vivo and in vitro. To study the metabolism of glibenclamide in Hnf-1alpha(-/-) animals, we analyzed liver extracts from [(3)H]glibenclamide-injected animals by reverse-phase chromatography. We found that the ratio of the concentrations of glibenclamide and its metabolites was moderately increased in livers of Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice, suggesting that hepatic glibenclamide metabolism was not impaired in animals with Hnf-1alpha deficiency. Our data demonstrate that high serum glibenclamide concentrations and an increased t(1/2) of glibenclamide in the blood of Hnf-1alpha(-/-) mice are caused by a defect in hepatic uptake of glibenclamide. This suggests that hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas in MODY3 patients may be due to impaired hepatic clearance and elevated plasma concentrations of the drug.

12478351|t|De novo HNF-1 beta gene mutation in familial hypoplastic glomerulocystic kidney disease.
12478351|a|Mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 beta are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (type V), non-diabetic renal disease, and occasionally genital malformations in females. Recently, familial hypoplastic glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) has been added to the clinical spectrum of HNF-1 beta gene mutations. Familial hypoplastic GCKD is a rare, dominantly inherited disorder characterized by small kidneys containing glomerular cysts, abnormal pelvicalyceal anatomy, and chronic renal failure. A family with hypoplastic GCKD occurring in the father and the daughter was screened for mutations in the HNF-1 beta gene. The sequence of exon 4 of the HNF-1 beta gene revealed a C insertion at codon 334 resulting in a frameshift mutation (P334fsinsC) in two family members. The P334fsinsC allele co-segregated with hypoplastic GCKD in the family. Oral glucose tolerance testing was normal in the 11-year-old girl. In her 38-year-old father, impaired glucose tolerance was detected. These studies provide further evidence that familial hypoplastic GCKD is associated with HNF-1 beta gene mutations. HNF-1 beta gene mutation screening may prove useful in patients with small cystic kidneys and chronic renal failure, in whom a definite renal diagnosis could otherwise only be established by renal biopsy.

12488960|t|Characterization of a naturally occurring mutation (L107I) in the HNF1 alpha (MODY3) gene.
12488960|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the gene encoding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, HNF1 alpha. In this study we have examined the in vivo and in vitro effects of a mutation (L107I) outside the DNA binding and dimerization domains in the N terminal part of the HNF1 alpha gene. METHODS: Beta-cell function of the affected family members was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test. Functional tests were carried out to explain the role of the mutation in vitro by transcriptional activity assay, Western blotting, DNA-binding assays and subcellular localization experiments. RESULTS: Affected family members showed an 86% decreased insulin response to glucose when compared to age-matched healthy control subjects. In vitro the mutation showed a 79% decrease in transcriptional activity as compared to wild type HNF1 alpha in HeLa cells lacking HNF1 alpha. The transcriptional activity was not suppressed when the mutant was co-expressed with wild type HNF1 alpha suggesting that the decreased activity was not mediated by a dominant negative mechanism. The L107I/HNF1alpha protein showed normal nuclear targeting but impaired binding to an HNF1 alpha consensus sequence. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the L107I substitution represents a MODY3 mutation which impairs beta-cell function by a loss-of-function mechanism.

12488961|t|High frequency of mutations in the HNF-1alpha gene in non-obese patients with diabetes of youth in Japanese and identification of a case of digenic inheritance.
12488961|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: There is an emerging epidemic of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus of youth in Japan and in many other developed countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene (TCF1) in a large group of Japanese patients with early-onset non-Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Since approximately 20% of Caucasian patients with HNF-1alpha mutations have been shown to be obese or overweight, we also examined the association of genetic variations in TCF1 with body weight in Japanese subjects. METHODS: We examined 203 patients with non-Type 1 diabetes who had been diagnosed before they reached 15 years of age. Ten exons and flanking introns of TCF1 of these patients were directly sequenced for mutations. RESULTS: We found 14 different mutations in 18 patients (8.9%), including one that was found to be de novo. The patients with the mutations had lower BMI (20.1+/-3.0 kg/m(2)) at diagnosis than the patients without them (24.5+/-6.0 kg/m(2)) (p=0.0024). All of the patients with the mutations, except for one, Y120, had normal body weight (BMI&lt;25 kg/m(2)); the frequency of HNF-1alpha mutations in the non-obese patients of this study was 17% (17/101). Patient Y120, who had atypical symptoms of mild obesity and insulin resistance at diagnosis, was found to have inherited an additional mutation in an obesity-related gene. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: A considerable number of non-obese Japanese patients with non-Type 1 diabetes of youth have HNF-1alpha-deficient diabetes. Lack of obesity could well be a characteristic feature of this form of diabetes.

12488962|t|Identification of three new mutations of the HNF-1 alpha gene in Japanese MODY families.
12488962|a|AIM/HYPOTHESIS: We analysed Japanese MODY patients for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene. METHODS: Fifty unrelated Japanese patients with early-onset diabetes (diagnosed at 25 years of age or younger) or with a strong family history of diabetes were screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene. Functional studies of the mutant HNF-1alpha were carried out. RESULTS: We identified three new mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in the families with a strong family history for diabetes. One mutation (L518P519fsTCC --&gt; A) was identified in three unrelated families, while the other two mutations (T521I and V617I) were identified in one family. We also identified the A site of the promoter (+102G-to-C), which was reported previously. We examined the functional properties of the mutant HNF-1alpha. By increasing the amount of L518P519fsTCC--&gt;A-HNF-1alpha, increasing inhibition of the transcription of human transthyretin (TTR) was observed (up to 61% of the control). Increasing amounts of T521I-HNF-1alpha or V617I-HNF-1alpha mutant proteins increased TTR promoter transcription up to 4.3-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively, whereas both increased transcription up to 12.4-fold of the control. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The L518P519fsTCC --&gt; A was identified for the first time and this mutation might be a common cause of Japanese MODY3 in Okinawa area. In addition, both the T521I and V617I mutations were present in two patients in the same family. Since the prevalence of these mutations is relatively high (10%, 5/50), the HNF-1 alpha gene needs to be screened for mutations in patients either with early-onset diabetes or with a strong family history for diabetes.

12530534|t|Evidence for haploinsufficiency of the human HNF1alpha gene revealed by functional characterization of MODY3-associated mutations.
12530534|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha is a homeo-domain-containing transcription factor participating in the regulation of gene expression in liver, kidney, gut and pancreas of vertebrates. In humans mutations in the HNF1 gene are responsible for one form of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). To define the molecular mechanism underlying MODY3 we investigated the functional properties of seven MODY3-associated mutations representing the spectrum of different kinds of mutations affecting all functional domains of the protein. The mutations introduced into an expression vector encoding human HNF1alpha include in-frame deletion (AN127), nonsense (Q7X, R171X), frameshift (P291fsinsC) and missense (R229Q, P447L, T6201) mutations. Gel retardation and reporter gene assays showed that the functional properties of these mutants differ dramatically, but none of these mutants act in a dominant negative manner. Moreover, the mRNA stability of the mutants AN127, R171X, P291fsinsC and T547E548fsdelTG is impaired compared to the wild-type sequence in transfected cells. This decreased RNA stability is independent of the presence of an intron in the expression vector and thus differs from mechanisms known to be involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Our results suggest that haploinsufficiency of HNF1alpha is responsible for the pathogenesis of MODY3.

12547858|t|Identifying hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha mutations in children and young adults with a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
12547858|a|OBJECTIVE: HNF-1alpha gene mutations (MODY3) present with marked hyperglycemia in lean young adults and may, therefore, be mistaken for type 1 diabetes, with implications for individual treatment and risk of diabetes in other family members. We examined the prevalence of HNF-1alpha mutations in families with three generations of diabetes identified in a population-based study of childhood diabetes, representing a subpopulation in which misclassification was likely. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a study population of 1,470 families, 36 families (2.4%) with three affected generations were identified. In the 18 families in whom DNA samples were available, islet autoantibody testing, HLA class II genotyping, and HNF-1alpha sequencing were performed. RESULTS: At least one islet autoantibody was found in 13 of 14 probands, and diabetes-associated HLA class II haplotypes were found in 17 of 18. One proband, who had no islet autoantibodies and was homozygous for the protective HLA haplotype DRB1*02-DQB1*0602, had a novel HNF-1alpha heterozygous nonsense mutation (R54X). This mutation cosegregated with diabetes in the family. The proband, his brother, mother, and maternal grandmother were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 14-18 years and treated with insulin (0.39-0.74 units/kg) from diagnosis. The mother has since been successfully transferred to sulfonylurea treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Family history alone is of limited value in identification of individuals with HNF-1alpha mutations, and we propose a stepwise approach that restricts sequencing of the HNF-1alpha gene to those with a family history of diabetes who also test negative for islet autoantibodies.

12574234|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene mutations and diabetes in Norway.
12574234|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), type 3. To estimate the prevalence of MODY3 in Norwegian diabetic pedigrees, we screened a total of 130 families for HNF-1 alpha mutations; 42 families with clinical MODY, 75 with suspected MODY, and 13 pedigrees with multiplex type 1 diabetes. Twenty-two families with clinical MODY, 15 families with suspected MODY, and one family with type 1 diabetes multiplex harbored HNF-1 alpha mutations. Thus, in about half of Norwegian families with clinical MODY, mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene could be detected. Eight of the 18 different mutations identified were novel (G47E, T196fsdelCCAA, IVS3-1G&gt;A, S256T, A276D, S445fsdelAG, M522V, and S531T). Haplotypes were determined for recurrent mutations, indicating a founder effect in Norway for the hot-spot mutation P291fsinsC and possibly also for P112L and R131W. To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MODY3, we investigated the functional properties of 13 HNF-1 alpha mutations. Two mutant HNF-1 alpha proteins (R171X, R263C) were unable to bind DNA and at least five mutants (R131W, R171X, P379fsdelCT, S445fsdelAG, and Q466X) showed defective nuclear translocation. Transcriptional activation was reduced for most of the MODY3-associated mutants. Accordingly, the functional studies of HNF-1 alpha mutants indicate that beta-cell dysfunction in MODY3 is caused by loss-of-function mechanisms like reduced DNA binding, impaired transcriptional activation, and defects in subcellular localization.

12618086|t|In silico searching of human and mouse genome data identifies known and unknown HNF1 binding sites upstream of beta-cell genes.
12618086|a|HNF1-alpha is a transcription factor present in beta-cells. Mutations in the HNF1-alpha gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), but the exact mechanism is not known. Several studies have highlighted genes down-regulated in beta-cells lacking this gene, but it is not clear if these are directly regulated by HNF1-alpha. To better understand this, we used human and mouse genome data to examine 29 genes expressed in the beta-cell. Using an in silico approach (with software available at www.BindGene.org) we examined 2kb upstream of each gene for possible HNF1 binding sequences. In five genes we also examined 100kb upstream of each gene, but only the portions strongly conserved between humans and mice. We identified nine putative HNF1 binding sites upstream of seven genes (p&lt;0.1 and good alignment between species or p&lt;0.05). Six of these nine sites had some experimental corroboratory evidence and included the recently identified sites 6 and 45kb upstream of HNF4-alpha. Three novel sites were identified. These were 92bp upstream of SLC3A1, 52bp upstream of PCBD (DCOH), and 42202bp upstream of TCF2(HNF1-beta). In conclusion, our computer search identified some known HNF1 sites, and suggested three novel sites indicating these genes are very likely to be directly activated by HNF1. This should help in designing experiments to discover the mechanisms of beta-cell dysfunction due to HNF1 disruption.

12646418|t|HNF-1alpha and endodermal transcription factors cooperatively activate Fabpl: MODY3 mutations abrogate cooperativity.
12646418|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha plays a central role in intestinal and hepatic gene regulation and is required for hepatic expression of the liver fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabpl). An Fabpl transgene was directly activated through cognate sites by HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta, as well as five other endodermal factors: CDX-1, C/EBPbeta, GATA-4, FoxA2, and HNF-4alpha. HNF-1alpha activated the Fabpl transgene by as much as 60-fold greater in the presence of the other five endodermal factors than in their absence, accounting for up to one-half the total transgene activation by the group of six factors. This degree of synergistic interaction suggests that multifactor cooperativity is a critical determinant of endodermal gene activation by HNF-1alpha. Mutations in HNF-1alpha that result in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3) provide evidence for the in vivo significance of these synergistic interactions. An R131Q HNF-1alpha MODY3 mutant exhibits complete loss of synergistic activation in concert with the other endodermal transcription factors despite wild-type transactivation ability in their absence. Furthermore, whereas wild-type HNF-1alpha exhibited pairwise cooperative synergy with each of the other five factors, the R131Q mutant could synergize only with GATA-4 and C/EBPbeta. Selective loss of synergy with other endodermal transcription factors accompanied by retention of native transactivation ability in an HNF-1alpha MODY mutant suggests in vivo significance for cooperative synergy.

12712243|t|Identification and functional characterization of a novel mutation of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in a Korean family with MODY3.
12712243|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: After screening 16 Korean families with early onset Type 2 diabetes in search for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) -1alpha gene mutation, we identified a novel missense mutation (R263L) associated with MODY phenotype. We studied the biological characteristics of the mutation and the potential functional consequences based on the crystallographic structure of HNF-1alpha in complex with DNA. METHODS: DNA from subjects with a familial form of early onset diabetes was isolated and HNF-1alpha was sequenced. The R263L substitution was generated by PCR-based sited-directed mutagenesis. Functional and biochemical studies were conducted by reporter assay using glucose-transporter type 2 (GLUT2) or insulin promoters and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively. RESULTS: Transfection of wild-type HNF-1alpha increased the reporter activities of GLUT2 and insulin promoters in NIH3T3 and SK-Hep1 cells, while R263L mutant was defective in transactivation of those promoters. Both wild-type HNF-1alpha and R263L mutant could not transactivate GLUT2 and insulin promoters in MIN6N8 insulinoma cells. R263L mutant had a defective cooperation with its heterodimeric partner HNF-1beta or coactivator p300. R263L mutant protein displayed greatly reduced DNA binding ability, despite its comparable protein stability to the wild-type HNF-1alpha. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the mutation of HNF-1alpha at codon 263 from arginine to leucine leads to the development of MODY3 through decreased insulin production and defective glucose sensing. These findings are in good agreement with the crystal structure in which R263 makes hydrogen bonds with phosphorus atoms of DNA backbone to mediate the stable binding of HNF-1alpha homeodomain to the promoter.

12726923|t|Genes, environment and Oji-Cree type 2 diabetes.
12726923|a|The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Canadian Oji-Cree is among the highest in the world. Our research has uncovered genetic determinants of Oji-Cree type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits. The most important genetic discovery by far was the private G319S mutation in transcription factor HNF-1alpha, encoded by the HNF1A gene. HNF1A G319S was discovered by candidate gene sequencing and would have been missed using the currently favored strategy of genome-wide scanning. G319S was associated with increased odds of having type 2 diabetes across the whole study sample and in all subgroups, including adolescent Oji-Cree. Furthermore, G319S had specificity and positive predictive value of 97% and 95%, respectively, for developing type 2 diabetes by age 50. The protein bearing the G319S mutation had impaired function in vitro. Sigmoidal modeling showed that each dose of the G319S allele accelerated the median age of diabetes onset by about 7 yr. This approach also showed that environment more strongly accelerated the median age-of-onset of Oji-Cree diabetes onset than did G319S, which could have implications for intervention strategies to reduce the burden of this epidemic. There is also evidence for genetic determination of related metabolic traits in the Oji-Cree.

12832318|t|Etiological investigation of diabetes in young adults presenting with apparent type 2 diabetes.
12832318|a|OBJECTIVE: Young adults with newly diagnosed apparent type 2 diabetes present the clinician with a wide differential diagnosis of possible etiology, including autoimmune and genetic causes as well as young-onset type 2 diabetes (YT2D). The characteristics of these groups have been described, but it is not known in which subjects investigation for etiology may be beneficial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 268 unselected U.K. Caucasian subjects diagnosed at ages 18-45 years and not treated with permanent insulin for &lt; or =6 months were studied. All subjects underwent clinical assessment and screening for GAD antibodies (GADA) and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 antibodies (IA-2A). Screening for a common mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) gene and the common mitochondrial mutation was performed in the antibody-negative subjects. Subjects without insulin resistance were selected for sequencing of the HNF-1 alpha gene. RESULTS: A specific etiology was defined in 11.6% of the 268 subjects and in 24.7% of the lean subjects. Twenty-six subjects (9.7%) were positive for a beta-cell antibody, one subject had familial partial lipodystrophy and the lamin A/C mutation R482W, and two subjects had the mitochondrial mutation A3243G. Two of 15 selected subjects had HNF-1 alpha mutations, the novel missense mutation A501T, and the previously reported R583Q. CONCLUSIONS: This unselected series shows that there is considerable heterogeneity in apparent YT2D. beta-Cell autoantibodies should be performed in all those presenting at ages 18-45 years. Genetic investigations can be targeted to phenotypically defined subjects. The finding of a specific etiology will allow individualization of management and give patients valuable information about their condition.

12882939|t|Genetic modifiers of the age at diagnosis of diabetes (MODY3) in carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha mutations map to chromosomes 5p15, 9q22, and 14q24.
12882939|a|Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha (MODY3) account for the largest proportion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) cases in the U.S. This form of diabetes is characterized by impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose, but wide variability exists in the severity of hyperglycemia and in the age at which it becomes clinically manifest. We have previously shown that the age at onset of diabetes in MODY3 families is influenced by familial factors (including modifying genes) and exposure to diabetes in utero. To identify genes influencing the onset of MODY3, we conducted a genome scan in 13 extended MODY families in which diabetes segregates with an HNF-1alpha mutation. Linkage with age at onset of diabetes was assessed by genetic variance component analysis using SOLAR. The locus with the strongest evidence of linkage was on chromosome 14q24 (D14S588; logarithm of odds [LOD] = 2.58, P = 0.0004). This location overlaps with IDDM11 and includes SEL1L, a negative regulator of the Notch pathway that may control islet development. Linkage evidence also supported loci on 5p15 (D5S817; LOD = 2.44, P = 0.0004) and 9q22 (D9S910; LOD = 2.02, P = 0.0018). The latter matches a region linked to 2-h insulin levels in Pima Indians. Less strong linkage evidence was observed at three other regions: chromosomes 3p24 (LOD = 1.44), 7q21 (1.20), and 16q23 (1.51). Our data are consistent with the existence of multiple loci that contribute to the expression of the MODY3 phenotype. Identification of these genes will offer new insights into the pathophysiology of MODY that may, in turn, increase our understanding of the cellular events underlying more common forms of diabetes.

14521933|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 negatively regulates amylin gene expression.
14521933|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic subtype of Type 2 diabetes, defined as having an early age of onset, with a dominant inheritance pattern. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), which is encoded by the MODY3 gene, has been shown to bind the insulin promoter. Since the promoters of three pancreas-specific genes involved in glucose homeostasis-insulin, glucokinase, and amylin bind similar transcription factors, we were interested in whether HNF1 could also regulate amylin expression. In the present study, we used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, to demonstrate that the HNF1 transcription factor can specifically bind to the amylin promoter. Moreover, co-transfection of an HNF1 expression vector with an amylin-CAT reporter plasmid decreased the activity of the amylin promoter by 85%. These data support the hypothesis that the amylin gene is regulated by HNF1 in a negative manner and may explain partially how HNF1 mutations result in diabetes.

14575972|t|Genetic cause of hyperglycaemia and response to treatment in diabetes.
14575972|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes shows evidence of underlying heterogeneity. No studies have assessed whether different causes for diabetes change the response to oral hypoglycaemic therapy. In a few cases, patients with diabetes caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene have been described as sensitive to the hypoglycaemic effects of sulphonylureas. We aimed to see whether the glycaemic response to the sulphonylurea gliclazide and the biguanide metformin differed in HNF-1alpha diabetes and type 2 diabetes, and to investigate the mechanism for differences in sulphonylurea sensitivity. METHODS: We did a randomised crossover trial of glicazide and metformin in 36 patients, either with diabetes caused by HNF-1alpha mutations or type 2 diabetes, who were matched for body-mass index and fasting plasma glucose. The primary outcome was reduction in fasting plasma glucose. Analysis was by intention to treat. We assessed possible mechanisms for sulphonylurea sensitivity through insulin sensitivity, insulin secretory response to glucose and tolbutamide, and tolbutamide clearance. FINDINGS: Patients with HNF-1alpha diabetes had a 5.2-fold greater response to gliclazide than to metformin (fasting plasma glucose reduction 4.7 vs 0.9 mmol/L, p=0.0007) and 3.9-fold greater response to gliclazide than those with type 2 diabetes (p=0.002). Patients with HNF-1alpha diabetes had a strong insulin secretory response to intravenous tolbutamide despite a small response to intravenous glucose, and were more insulin sensitive than those with type 2 diabetes. Sulphonylurea metabolism was similar in both patient groups. INTERPRETATION: The cause of hyperglycaemia changes the response to hypoglycaemic drugs; HNF-1alpha diabetes has marked sulphonylurea sensitivity. This pharmacogenetic effect is consistent with models of HNF-1alpha deficiency, which show that the beta-cell defect is upstream of the sulphonylurea receptor. Definition of the genetic basis of hyperglycaemia has implications for patient management.

14747304|t|Messenger RNA transcripts of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene containing premature termination codons are subject to nonsense-mediated decay.
14747304|a|Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1a) gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Approximately 30% of these mutations generate mRNA transcripts harboring premature termination codons (PTCs). Degradation of such transcripts by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway has been reported for many genes. To determine whether PTC mutant transcripts of the HNF-1alpha gene elicit NMD, we have developed a novel quantitative RT-PCR assay. We performed quantification of ectopically expressed mutant transcripts relative to normal transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines using a coding single nucleotide polymorphism (cSNP) as a marker. The nonsense mutations R171X, I414G415ATCG--&gt;CCA, and P291fsinsC showed reduced mutant mRNA expression to 40% (P = 0.009), &lt;0.01% (P &lt;/= 0.0001), and 6% (P = 0.001), respectively, of the normal allele. Transcript levels were restored using the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that the instability arises from NMD. The missense mutations G207D and R229P did not show NMD although R229P exhibited moderate RNA instability. This study provides the first evidence that HNF-1alpha PTC mutations may be subject to NMD. Mutations that result in significant reduction of protein levels due to NMD will not have dominant-negative activity in vivo. Haploinsufficiency is therefore likely to be the most important mutational mechanism of HNF-1alpha mutations causing MODY.

15001650|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene inactivation: cosegregation between liver adenomatosis and diabetes phenotypes in two maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)3 families.
15001650|a|Heterozygous germline mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)3. Recently, the biallelic inactivation of the HNF-1 alpha gene was reported in liver adenomas. We show the occurrence of liver adenomatosis in six MODY3-affected patients from two unrelated and large families. Liver adenomatosis was characterized by the presence of numerous adenomas within a normal hepatic parenchyma. The HNF-1 alpha hot-spot germline mutation P291fs was identified in the two probands and in 16 relatives from the two families. The six patients affected by liver adenomatosis and diabetes exhibited the mutation. The analysis of liver-cell tumors from two affected patients evidenced the biallelic inactivation of HNF-1 alpha. The familial screening confirmed the clinical heterogeneity of the liver phenotype, from silent liver adenomatosis to fatal hemorrhage. These observations warrant the systematic screening for liver adenomatosis in MODY3 families to prevent its potentially deadly complications. Moreover, such screening may help to determine if a particular mutational spectrum of HNF-1 alpha is associated with liver adenomatosis and to establish its prevalence in this frequent form of diabetes in the young adult.

15111528|t|Contrasting diabetes phenotypes associated with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha and -1beta mutations.
15111528|a|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the highly homologous transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and -1beta cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young types 3 and 5, respectively. Diabetes due to HNF-1alpha mutations is well characterized. However, physiological assessment of the HNF-1beta phenotype is limited. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the diabetes phenotype due to HNF-1beta mutations is similar to that in HNF-1alpha. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting biochemistry and a tolbutamide-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were compared in matched HNF-1beta, HNF-1alpha, type 2 diabetic, and control subjects. Homeostasis model assessment indexes were determined from fasting insulin and glucose. The peak measures for the insulin increment after tolbutamide and for the insulin increment after glucose were determined from the IVGTT. RESULTS: The HNF-1beta patients showed a 2.4-fold reduction in insulin sensitivity compared with the HNF-1alpha patients (P = 0.001) with fasting insulin concentrations 2.7-fold higher (P = 0.004). HNF-1beta patients had lower HDL cholesterol (1.17 vs. 1.46 mmol/l; P = 0.009) and higher triglyceride (2.2 vs. 1.35 mmol/l; P = 0.015) levels than HNF-1alpha patients. The HNF-1beta patients had similar beta-cell responses to tolbutamide and glucose as the type 2 diabetic patients, but in the HNF-1alpha patients, the tolbutamide response was considerably increased relative to the response to glucose (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: HNF-1beta patients have a different diabetes phenotype than HNF-1alpha patients. Those with HNF-1beta mutations have hyperinsulinemia and associated dyslipidemia consistent with insulin resistance and may have a different beta-cell defect. This suggests that despite considerable homology and a shared binding site, HNF-1alpha and HNF-1beta have a different role in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis. This result suggests a new etiological pathway for insulin resistance involving HNF-1beta.

15139733|t|'I don't feel like a diabetic any more': the impact of stopping insulin in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young following genetic testing.
15139733|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the commonest cause of monogenic diabetes but is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes. The availability of genetic testing in MODY has improved diagnosis. Sulphonylurea sensitivity in HNF-1alpha patients means that those on insulin from diagnosis can transfer to sulphonylureas and may improve glycaemic control. To gain insight into the implications for patients of stopping insulin, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight HNF-1alpha patients transferred to sulphonylureas after a median of 20 years on insulin. Thematic content analysis highlighted four key themes: Fear, anxiety and excitement regarding stopping insulin, particularly among those who had been on insulin for many years or had never omitted insulin in the past. Improved lifestyle and self image accompanied by feelings of relief and 'increased normality'. Reflections on their time on insulin, including feelings of annoyance, particularly when the need for insulin treatment had been questioned at diagnosis. Difficulty 'letting go' of insulin treatment--some patients found it hard to believe that they no longer required injections as this conflicted with messages previously received from healthcare professionals. Transferring from insulin to sulphonylureas had a positive impact on lifestyle but support was needed for patients to adjust, many having grown up with the belief they would be on insulin for life.

15220216|t|Cosegregation of MIDD and MODY in a pedigree: functional and clinical consequences.
15220216|a|The aim of this study was characterization of a family carrying two mutations known to cause monogenic forms of diabetes, the M626K mutation in the HNF1alpha gene (MODY3) and the A3243G in mtDNA. Beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were assessed with the Botnia clamp. Heteroplasmy of the A3243G mutation and variants in type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes were determined, and transcriptional activity, DNA binding, and subcellular localization of mutated HNF1alpha were studied. Thirteen family members carried the mutation in mtDNA; 6 of them also had the M626K mutation, whereas none had only the M626K mutation. The protective Ala12 allele in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma was present in two nondiabetic individuals. Carriers of both mtDNA and HNF1alpha mutations showed an earlier age at onset of diabetes than carriers of only the mtDNA mutation (median 22 vs. 45 years) but no clear difference in beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity. In vitro, the M626K mutation caused a 53% decrease in transcriptional activity in HeLa cells. The mutated protein showed normal nuclear targeting but increased DNA binding. These data demonstrate that several genetic factors might contribute to diabetes risk, even in families with mtDNA and HNF1alpha mutations.

15305805|t|Spectrum of HNF1A and GCK mutations in Canadian families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
15305805|a|PURPOSE: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of type 2 diabetes characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance and early onset. The pathophysiology of MODY is primarily defective insulin secretion resulting from mutations in at least 6 different genes. Most affected patients harbour mutations in either GCK (encoding glucokinase, also called MODY2) and HNF1A (encoding hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha, also called MODY3). We studied Canadian probands to determine if they had mutations in MODY2 or MODY3 genes. METHOD: We used genomic DNA sequencing of probands from 9 previously unreported Canadian MODY families. RESULTS: Five MODY probands had mutations in HNF1A, of which 4 were novel (namely IVS5-1delTAG, E275fsdelGAAG, F268S and L44fsdelC) and 4 had mutations in GCK, of which 2 were novel (E237K and L324P). These mutations expand the spectrum of MODY mutations and bring the total number of Canadian MODY families that have been molecularly defined in our laboratory to 15 (8 MODY3 and 7 MODY2). CONCLUSION: Because of the growing evidence that molecular diagnosis may affect prognosis and treatment, this information may be important in future for Canadian MODY families and their physicians.

15387959|t|[Etiological dissection in common anti-islet autoantibody-negative patients with type 1 diabetes].
15387959|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the immunological and genetic factors of common anti-islet autoantibody-negative patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Specimens of peripheral blood were collected from 33 common autoantibody (GAD-Ab, IA2-Ab, IAA, TGA and TPO-Ab) negative diabetic patients with new-onset of unprovoked ketosis (or ketoacidosis), and genome DNA was extracted. The antibodies to carboxypeptide-H (CPH) and SOX13 (ICA12) were detected by radioligand assay. The gene mutations of MODY3 (HNF-1alpha) and MODY6 (NeuroD1/Beta2) were detected by PCR-SSCP sequencing. Mitochondrial gene mutations were analyzed with PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Two (6%) of the patients were SOX13-Ab positive, while none of them was positive for CPH-Ab. Gene mutation detection found one case of a new mutation, R321H (CGC-->CAC) in the exon 5 of HNF-1alpha gene and one case with ND1 mt3316 G-->A mutation in mitochondrial DNA. In addition to the diabetes-associated mutations described above, seven polymorphisms of HNF-1alpha gene, including L17L, I27L, L459L, S487N, IVS5 + 9 C > G, IVS6-42 G > T, and IVS7 + 7 G > A, and one NeuroD1/Beta2 gene polymorphic variant Ala45Thr, were found. CONCLUSION: Autoimmunity and gene mutations (such as MODY3 and mitochondrial genes mutations) may be etiological in a few cases initially diagnosed as autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes. Autoimmunity and MODY and mitochondrial diabetes should be excluded if idiopathic type 1 (type 1B) diabetes is diagnosed.

15657605|t|Genetic and clinical characteristics of maturity-onset diabetes of the young in Chinese patients.
15657605|a|In Caucasians, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is mostly caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha (MODY3) and glucokinase (MODY2) genes. Most Japanese MODY patients, however, are not linked to known MODY genes. In this study, we examined the genetic and clinical characteristics of Chinese subjects with MODY. The study included 146 unrelated families fulfilling the minimum criteria for MODY: two consecutive generations of type II diabetes with at least one member diagnosed under the age of 25. We screened for mutations in the HNF-4alpha (MODY1), MODY2 and MODY3 genes by direct sequencing. Antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab) was measured in subjects with MODY of unknown cause (MODYX). Insulin resistance index and other clinical data were compared in sex-, age- and duration-matched MODY3 and MODYX patients. In all, 13 families had MODY3 mutations and two had MODY2 mutations. No MODY1 mutation was found. Four of the 12 different MODY3 mutations were newly identified novel mutations (Q243E, A311D, P379R and P488fsdelC). In subjects with MODYX, 3% were GAD-Ab positive and 60% were overweight. Compared to MODY3 patients, MODYX patients had higher body mass index (P&lt;0.02), higher insulin resistance index (P=0.001) and triglyceride level (P&lt;0.02), lower HDL level (P=0.001) and more hypertension (P&lt;0.05), but no significant difference in the prevalence of diabetic complications. In conclusion, MODY3 and MODY2 account for only 9 and 1%, respectively, of Chinese MODY. A majority of Chinese MODY patients are due to defects in unknown genes and appear to be characterized by insulin resistance.

15660729|t|Clinical characteristics, beta-cell function, HLA class II and mutations in MODY genes in non-paediatric subjects with Type 1 diabetes without pancreatic autoantibodies.
15660729|a|OBJECTIVE: To study clinical characteristics, beta-cell function, HLA typing and mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) patients without pancreatic autoantibodies. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients without pancreatic autoantibodies (Ab neg) and 20 with autoantibodies (Ab pos), age/gender matched, were included (age 17-34 years). Islet cell, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase and insulin autoantibodies, basal and stimulated C-peptide were measured. HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 typing and screening for mutations in the HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes were performed. RESULTS: No differences were found in clinical presentation, metabolic control and beta-cell function in the two groups (onset or after 12 months). DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 was the most frequent haplotype in both groups but we found a higher proportion of protective T1D haplotypes and Asp(beta57) in the Ab neg group, but in all the cases in combination with susceptible T1D haplotypes. We found two previously reported polymorphisms (HNF-1alpha, Ala98Val; HNF-4alpha, Thr130Ile) in Ab neg and a new variant (Ser165Gly) in the HNF-4alpha gene in an Ab pos subject. Conclusions In a non-paediatric population with newly diagnosed T1D, the absence of islet antibodies does not imply clinical or metabolic differences when compared with those cases with islet antibodies. Despite a similar HLA-DR/DQ typing, the presence of protective alleles and molecular properties in a higher proportion in the Ab neg group suggests that these factors could modulate the presence or absence of islet antibodies. Variants in HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha are unlikely to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of diabetes in antibody-negative T1D.

15693590|t|[Molecular diagnosis on indication of maturity onset diabetes of the young; results from 184 patients].
15693590|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of mutation analysis of the genes involved in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) types 1-3. DESIGN: Descriptive. METHOD: In the period July 2000-October 2003 the DNA from 184 possible MODY patients was analysed for the presence of mutations of the genes involved in MODY types 1, 2 and 3. The patients fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed before the age of 25, or at least before the age of 40, there was a family history of diabetes mellitus at an early age, there were no characteristics to indicate diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2. RESULTS: In the blood of 65 patients (35%) a pathogenic gene mutation was found. A total of 45 patients had a mutation in the HNF-1alpha-gene (which is linked to MODY3), 11 in the glucokinase gene (MODY2) and 9 in the HNF-4alpha-gene (MODY1). Of all the HNF-1alpha-gene mutations, the insertion of a C in codon 291 was the most frequently seen (in 11 families). A mutation in exon 9 of the HNF-1alpha-gene was also shown in 9 apparently non-related families, which probably was a founder mutation. CONCLUSION: The MODY subtype was found in one third of the selected patients. This diagnosis may have implications in the clinical management of the patient.

15841481|t|Identification of novel GCK and HNF1A/TCF1 mutations and polymorphisms in German families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).
15841481|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus, characterized by an early age at onset and a primary defect in beta-cell function. Forty families with a clinical presentation suggestive of MODY were screened for the most common MODY subtypes caused by mutations in the genes encoding glucokinase (GCK, MODY2) and hepatocyte nuclear 1-alpha (HNF1A/TCF1, MODY3). Overall, 14 mutations were found (35%) giving a relative frequency of 22.5% and 12.5% for MODY2 and MODY3, respectively. Five of the nine GCK mutations identified were novel and included two deletions, two nonsense, and one splice site mutation. The GCK splice donor mutation was shown to result in an aberrant transcript owing to the recruitment of a cryptic splice site. The translated protein is predicted to contain an in frame insertion of nine amino acids. Among the five HNF1A mutations identified, three were novel comprising one missense mutation, one deletion, and one insertion. In addition, several novel polymorphisms within GCK were identified and their allele frequencies estimated. Knowledge of the genetic cause of MODY has significant impact on therapeutic decision making and may help to identify family members at risk for diabetes.

15928245|t|Half of clinically defined maturity-onset diabetes of the young patients in Denmark do not have mutations in HNF4A, GCK, and TCF1.
15928245|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous monogenic form of diabetes characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance, an early clinical onset, and a primary defect in beta-cell function. The aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence and nature of mutations in the three common MODY genes, HNF4A, GCK, and TCF1, in Danish patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY and to describe metabolic differences in probands with and without mutations in HNF4A, GCK, and TCF1. METHODS: Seventy-eight unrelated subjects of Danish Caucasian origin (29 men, 49 women) and their 351 family members were examined. The promotor and coding regions including intron-exon boundaries of HNF4A, GCK, and TCF1 were examined by denaturing HPLC and/or direct sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 29 different mutations in 38 MODY families. Fifteen of the mutations were novel. The variants segregated with diabetes within the families, and none of the variants were found in 100 normal Danish chromosomes. Our findings suggest a relative prevalence of 3% of MODY1 (two different mutations in two families), 10% of MODY2 (seven in eight), and 36% of MODY3 (21 in 28) among Danish kindred clinically diagnosed as MODY. No significant differences in biochemical and anthropometric measurements were observed at baseline examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-nine percent of the families carried mutations in the three examined MODY genes. Our findings highlight that unidentified MODY genes may play a central role for diabetes characterized by autosomal dominant transmission. Furthermore, baseline measurements of various anthropometric and biochemical variables are not appropriate markers of MODYX.

15983330|t|Beta-cell dysfunction, insulin sensitivity, and glycosuria precede diabetes in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha mutation carriers.
15983330|a|OBJECTIVE: Patients with diabetes due to hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha mutations have beta-cell deficiency, insulin sensitivity, altered proinsulin levels, and a low renal threshold for glucose. It is uncertain how many of these features precede the development of diabetes. The aim of our study was to test for these characteristics in young nondiabetic HNF-1alpha mutation carriers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 47 offspring from 19 extended families underwent genetic testing, a standard oral glucose tolerance test, and urine testing. RESULTS: HNF-1alpha mutations were found in 20 offspring, 7 with diabetes and 13 without diabetes. The 13 nondiabetic mutation carriers were compared with 27 family control subjects, who were matched for age, sex, and BMI. There was marked beta-cell deficiency with reduced insulinogenic index (53.5 [31.5-90.9] vs. 226.0 [126.0-407.1], SD [range], P &lt; 0.001) and area under the curve for insulin (P &lt; 0.001). Insulin sensitivity was increased in mutation carriers (homeostatic model assessment of insulin sensitivity 144.6 [82.7-252.7] vs. 100 [66.9-149.4], P = 0.025). A total of 38% of mutation carriers had glycosuria at 2 h compared with 0% of control subjects (P = 0.0034). Those with glycosuria had peak glucose values that were higher than the mutations carriers without glycosuria (range 8.1-11.8 vs. 6.2-8.4 mmol/l, P = 0.002). The seven subjects with diabetes all showed glycosuria. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that marked beta-cell deficiency, increased insulin sensitivity, and a low renal threshold are present in young nondiabetic HNF-1alpha mutation carriers. The presence of glycosuria post-glucose load could be used to screen children of mutation carriers as it occurs in all mutation carriers with a peak glucose in the oral glucose tolerance test &gt;8.4 mmol/l.

16046299|t|Association of common variation in the HNF1alpha gene region with risk of type 2 diabetes.
16046299|a|It is currently unclear how often genes that are mutated to cause rare, early-onset monogenic forms of disease also harbor common variants that contribute to the more typical polygenic form of each disease. The gene for MODY3 diabetes, HNF1alpha, lies in a region that has shown linkage to late-onset type 2 diabetes (12q24, NIDDM2), and previous association studies have suggested a weak trend toward association for common missense variants in HNF1alpha with glucose-related traits. Based on genotyping of 79 common SNPs in the 118 kb spanning HNF1alpha, we selected 21 haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyped them in &gt;4,000 diabetic patients and control subjects from Sweden, Finland, and Canada. Several SNPs from the coding region and 5' of the gene demonstrated nominal association with type 2 diabetes, with the most significant marker (rs1920792) having an odds ratio of 1.17 and a P value of 0.002. We then genotyped three SNPs with the strongest evidence for association to type 2 diabetes (rs1920792, I27L, and A98V) in an additional 4,400 type 2 diabetic and control subjects from North America and Poland and compared our results with those of the original sample and of Weedon et al. None of the results were consistently observed across all samples, with the possible exception of a modest association of the rare (3-5%) A98V variant. These results indicate that common variants in HNF1alpha either play no role in type 2 diabetes, a very small role, or a role that cannot be consistently observed without consideration of as yet unmeasured genetic or environmental modifiers.

16046319|t|A large-scale association analysis of common variation of the HNF1alpha gene with type 2 diabetes in the U.K. Caucasian population.
16046319|a|HNF1alpha (TCF1) is a key transcription factor that is essential for pancreatic beta-cell development and function. Rare mutations of HNF1alpha cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young. A common variant, G319S, private to the Oji-Cree population, predisposes to type 2 diabetes, but the role of common HNF1alpha variation in European populations has not been comprehensively assessed. We determined the linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structure across the HNF1alpha gene region using 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Eight tagging SNPs (tSNPs) that efficiently capture common haplotypes and the amino acid-changing variant, A98V, were genotyped in 5,307 subjects (2,010 type 2 diabetic case subjects, 1,643 control subjects, and 1,654 members of 521 families). We did not find any evidence of association between the tSNPs or haplotypes and type 2 diabetes. We could exclude odds ratios (ORs) &gt;1.25 for all tSNPs. The rare V98 allele (approximately 3% frequency) showed possible evidence of association with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.23 [95% CI 0.99-1.54], P = 0.07), a result that was supported by meta-analysis of this and published studies (OR 1.31 [1.08-1.59], P = 0.007). Further studies are required to investigate this association, demonstrating the difficulty of defining the role of rare (&lt;5%) alleles in type 2 diabetes risk.

The most common subtypes are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factor HNF-1a (MODY 3) and the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (GCK) (MODY 2). MODY 2 is the most benign form of diabetes as the threshold for glucose sensing is elevated resulting in mild, regulated hyperglycemia. MODY 2 may usually be treated with diet alone without risk of microvascular complications. Patients with MODY usually present as children or young adults. Genetic testing for MODY in diabetic subjects is often not performed because of the costs and its unavailability in Switzerland. We describe the impact of the genetic analysis for MODY 2 on diabetes management and treatment costs in a five-year-old girl. The patient and her diabetic mother were both found to have a heterozygous missense mutation (V203A) in the glucokinase gene. The five-year-old girl was started on insulin therapy for her diabetes but because her HbA1c remained between 5.8-6.4% (reference 4.1-5.7%) and her clinical presentation suggested MODY insulin was discontinued. She is now well controlled on a carbohydrate controlled diet regimen only. Omission of insulin treatment made regular blood glucose monitoring unnecessary and removed her risk of hypoglycemia. Costs for the genetic analysis were 500 Euro. At our centre costs for diabetes care of a patient with type 1 diabetes are approximately 2050 Euro/year compared to 410 Euro/year for the care of a patient with MODY 2. In addition, a diagnosis of MODY 2 may reassure patients and their families, as microvascular complications are uncommon. Thus there are both health and financial benefits in diagnosing MODY 2. We recommend genetic testing for MODY 2 in clinically selected patients even though this analysis is currently not available in Switzerland and costs are not necessarily covered by the health insurances.

16241915|t|Synergism between mutant HNF1A and the metabolic syndrome in Oji-Cree Type 2 diabetes.
16241915|a|AIMS: To determine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the Sandy Lake Oji-Cree and to examine its interaction with HNF1A in association with impaired glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using data collected from the Sandy Lake Health and Diabetes Project (1993-1995), the presence or absence of the metabolic syndrome was determined in 515 Oji-Cree subjects, &gt; or = 18 years of age. In the original study, fasting plasma analytes were measured, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was administered, and subjects were genotyped for HNF1A G319S. RESULTS: The unadjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the Oji-Cree adults was 29.9%. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for Type 2 diabetes among subjects who carried the HNF1A G319S mutation and had the modified metabolic syndrome (excluding hyperglycaemia) was 20.3 (6.94, 59.6). Adjusted ORs for Type 2 diabetes for subjects with either the HNF1A G319S mutation alone or the modified metabolic syndrome alone were 5.56 (2.85, 10.9) and 4.84 (2.53, 9.27), respectively. The risk of having impaired glucose tolerance was not influenced by the presence of either factor. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of Type 2 diabetes was similar (approximately five-fold increased) for subjects with either the presence of the modified metabolic syndrome or the private HNF1A G319S mutation. Interestingly, when present in combination, the two independent risk factors appeared to act synergistically to confer an even greater increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

16268330|t|Molecular genetics goes to the diabetes clinic.
16268330|a|Diabetes has historically been thought of as a medical specialty which primarily deals with treatment rather than diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing can now be used to make a diagnosis of the 1-2% of all diabetic patients with monogenic diabetes. Making a diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is important as it can have a dramatic effect on the treatment a patient should receive: glucokinase MODY patients need no treatment; HNF1alpha MODY patients are very sensitive to low dose sulphonylureas; and patients with neonatal diabetes due to Kir6.2 mutations, despite being insulin dependent, can discontinue insulin and be well controlled on high dose sulphonylurea tablets. The challenge for diabetologists is to use clinical skills to detect these monogenic patients whose care will be greatly helped by the treatment changes that follow molecular genetic testing.

16752173|t|Common variants in MODY genes increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.
16752173|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Impaired beta cell function is the hallmark of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and MODY. In addition, women with MODY gene mutations often present with GDM, but it is not known whether common variants in MODY genes contribute to GDM. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We genotyped five common variants in the glucokinase (GCK, commonly known as MODY2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A, commonly known as MODY3) and 4-alpha (HNF4A commonly known as MODY1) genes in 1,880 Scandinavian women (648 women with GDM and 1,232 pregnant non-diabetic control women). RESULTS: The A allele of the GCK -30G--&gt;A polymorphism was more common in GDM women than in control subjects (odds ratio [OR] 1.28 [95% CI 1.06-1.53], p=0.008, corrected p value, p=0.035). Under a recessive model [AA vs GA+GG], the OR increased further to 2.12 (95% CI 1.21-3.72, p=0.009). The frequency of the L allele of the HNF1A I27L polymorphism was slightly higher in GDM than in controls (1.16 [95% CI 1.001-1.34], p=0.048, corrected p value, p=0.17). However, the OR increased under a dominant model (LL+IL vs II; 1.31 [95% CI 1.08-1.60], p=0.007). The rs2144908, rs2425637 and rs1885088 variants, which are located downstream of the primary beta cell promoter (P2) of HNF4A, were not associated with GDM. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The -30G--&gt;A polymorphism of the beta-cell-specific promoter of GCK and the I27L polymorphism of HNF1A seem to increase the risk of GDM in Scandinavian women.

16760222|t|Isomers of the TCF1 gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha show differential expression in the pancreas and define the relationship between mutation position and clinical phenotype in monogenic diabetes.
16760222|a|The generation of multiple transcripts by mRNA processing has the potential to moderate differences in gene expression both between tissues and at different stages of development. Where gene function is compromised by mutation, the presence of multiple isoforms may influence the resulting phenotype. Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A or TCF1 gene) result in early-onset diabetes as a result of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. We investigated the expression of the three alternatively processed isoforms of the HNF1A gene and their impact on the phenotype associated with mutations. Real-time PCR demonstrated variation in tissue expression of HNF1A isomers: HNF1A(A), with the lowest transactivation activity compared with the truncated isoforms HNF1A(B) and HNF1A(C), is the major isomer in liver (54%) and kidney (67%) but not in adult pancreas (24%) and islets (26%). However, in fetal pancreas HNF1A(A) is the major transcript (84%), which supports developmental regulation of isomer expression. We examined whether the isomers affected by the mutation altered the diabetes phenotype in 564 subjects with 123 mutations in HNF1A. Mutations that affected only isomer HNF1A(A) (exons 8-10) were diagnosed later (25.5 years) than mutations affecting all three isomers (exons 1-6) (18.0 years) (P=0.006). This first genotype/phenotype relationship described for patients with HNF1A mutations is explained by isomer structure and not by either mutation type or functional domain. We conclude that all three isomers may be critical for beta-cell function and could play a role in both the developing and mature beta cell.

16834925|t|Identification of four novel mutations in the HNF-1A gene in Chinese early-onset and/or multiplex diabetes pedigrees.
16834925|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A gene cause the type 3 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). This study was undertaken to determine mutations and sequence variations of the HNF-1A gene in Chinese with familial early-onset and/or multiplex diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We screened all ten exons of the HNF-1A gene, including exon/intron junctions, by direct sequencing in 272 unrelated Chinese, including 80 healthy controls and 192 probands of early-onset and/or multiplex diabetes pedigrees. RESULTS: In addition to one silent mutation of c.864 G &gt; C [p.G288G] in exon4 at codon 288, which had been reported previously, a total of four novel mutations including two missense mutations (c.245C &gt; T [p.T82M] and c. 390 G &gt; T [p.Q130H]) and one frameshift mutation P353fsdelACGGGCCTGGAGC and one silent mutation c.759 G &gt; T [p.G253G] were identified. Moreover, eleven substitutions were identified in 192 probands. Of these, three variants (-8 G &gt; A, -128 T &gt; G and IVS2 + 21 G &gt; A) were not observed in 80 healthy controls and one of them (-8 G &gt; A) was not reported previously and the two promoter variants co-segregated with diabetes. The genotype and allele frequencies of the other eight variants in the diabetic patients were not significantly different from those in the healthy controls. No significant relationships were observed between the eight variants of the HNF-1A gene and clinical variables (plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and fasting lipid profile). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of structural mutations in the HNF-1A gene responsible for familial early-onset and/or multiplex diabetes appears to be rare among Chinese patients.

16917892|t|Mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A) and 4 alpha (HNF4A) in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
16917892|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early age of onset (often &lt;25 years of age), and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. MODY is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with six different genes identified to date; glucokinase (GCK), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A, or TCF1), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4A), insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF1 or PDX1), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF1B or TCF2), and neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1). Mutations in the HNF1A gene are a common cause of MODY in the majority of populations studied. A total of 193 different mutations have been described in 373 families. The most common mutation is Pro291fs (P291fsinsC) in the polycytosine (poly C) tract of exon 4, which has been reported in 65 families. HNF4A mutations are rarer; 31 mutations reported in 40 families. Sensitivity to treatment with sulfonylurea tablets is a feature of both HNF1A and HNF4A mutations. The identification of an HNF1A or 4A gene mutation confirms a diagnosis of MODY and has important implications for clinical management.

16930618|t|Diabetes mellitus due to misfolding of a beta-cell transcription factor: stereospecific frustration of a Schellman motif in HNF-1alpha.
16930618|a|Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3), a monogenic form of type II diabetes mellitus, results most commonly from mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha). Diabetes-associated mutation G20R perturbs the dimerization domain of HNF-1alpha, an intertwined four-helix bundle. In the wild-type structure G20 participates in a Schellman motif to cap an alpha-helix; its dihedral angles lie in the right side of the Ramachandran plot (alpha(L) region; phi 97 degrees). Substitutions G20R and G20A lead to dimeric molten globules of low stability, suggesting that the impaired function of the diabetes-associated transcription factor is due in large part to a main-chain perturbation rather than to specific features of the Arg side-chain. This hypothesis is supported by the enhanced stability of non-standard analogues containing D-Ala or D-Ser at position 20. The crystal structure of the D-Ala20 analogue, determined to a resolution of 1.4 A, is essentially identical to the wild-type structure in the same crystal form. The mean root-mean-square deviation between equivalent C(alpha) atoms (residues 5-28) is 0.3 A; (phi, psi) angles of D-Ala20 are the same as those of G20 in the wild-type structure. Whereas the side-chain of A20 or R20 would be expected to clash with the preceding carbonyl oxygen (thus accounting for its frustrated energy landscape), the side-chain of D-Ala20 projects into solvent without perturbation of the Schellman motif. Calorimetric studies indicate that the increased stability of the D-Ala20 analogue (DeltaDeltaG(u) 1.5 kcal/mol) is entropic in origin, consistent with a conformational bias toward native-like conformations in the unfolded state. Studies of multiple substitutions at G20 and neighboring positions highlight the essential contributions of a glycine-specific tight turn and adjoining inter-subunit side-chain hydrogen bonds to the stability and architectural specificity of the intertwined dimer. Comparison of L- and D amino acid substitutions thus provides an example of the stereospecific control of an energy landscape by a helix-capping residue.

16936201|t|Common variants in maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes contribute to risk of type 2 diabetes in Finns.
16936201|a|Prior reports have suggested that variants in the genes for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) may confer susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but results have been conflicting and coverage of the MODY genes has been incomplete. To complement our previous studies of HNF4A, we examined the other five known MODY genes for association with type 2 diabetes in Finnish individuals. For each of the five genes, we selected 1) nonredundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (r(2)&lt; 0.8 with other SNPs) from the HapMap database or another linkage disequilibrium map, 2) SNPs with previously reported type 2 diabetes association, and 3) nonsynonymous coding SNPs. We tested 128 SNPs for association with type 2 diabetes in 786 index cases from type 2 diabetic families and 619 normal glucose-tolerant control subjects. We followed up 35 of the most significant SNPs by genotyping them on another 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from Finland. We also supplemented our previous HNF4A results by genotyping 12 SNPs on additional Finnish samples. After correcting for testing multiple correlated SNPs within a gene, we find evidence of type 2 diabetes association with SNPs in five of the six known MODY genes: GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, NEUROD1, and HNF4A. Our data suggest that common variants in several MODY genes play a modest role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility.

17192490|t|Screening of 134 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with type 2 diabetes replicates association with 12 SNPs in nine genes.
17192490|a|More than 120 published reports have described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and type 2 diabetes. However, multiple studies of the same variant have often been discordant. From a literature search, we identified previously reported type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs. We initially genotyped 134 SNPs on 786 index case subjects from type 2 diabetes families and 617 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance from Finland and excluded from analysis 20 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2) &gt; 0.8) with another typed SNP. Of the 114 SNPs examined, we followed up the 20 most significant SNPs (P &lt; 0.10) on an additional 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from a population-based study in Finland. In the combined data, we replicated association (P &lt; 0.05) for 12 SNPs: PPARG Pro12Ala and His447, KCNJ11 Glu23Lys and rs5210, TNF -857, SLC2A2 Ile110Thr, HNF1A/TCF1 rs2701175 and GE117881_360, PCK1 -232, NEUROD1 Thr45Ala, IL6 -598, and ENPP1 Lys121Gln. The replication of 12 SNPs of 114 tested was significantly greater than expected by chance under the null hypothesis of no association (P = 0.012). We observed that SNPs from genes that had three or more previous reports of association were significantly more likely to be replicated in our sample (P = 0.03), although we also replicated 4 of 58 SNPs from genes that had only one previous report of association.

17327436|t|Evaluation of common variants in the six known maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes for association with type 2 diabetes.
17327436|a|An important question in human genetics is the extent to which genes causing monogenic forms of disease harbor common variants that may contribute to the more typical form of that disease. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the extent to which common variation in the six known maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes, which cause a monogenic form of type 2 diabetes, is associated with type 2 diabetes. Specifically, we determined patterns of common sequence variation in the genes encoding Gck, Ipf1, Tcf2, and NeuroD1 (MODY2 and MODY4-MODY6, respectively), selected a comprehensive set of 107 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that captured common variation, and genotyped each in 4,206 patients and control subjects from Sweden, Finland, and Canada (including family-based studies and unrelated case-control subjects). All SNPs with a nominal P value &lt;0.1 for association to type 2 diabetes in this initial screen were then genotyped in an additional 4,470 subjects from North America and Poland. Of 30 nominally significant SNPs from the initial sample, 8 achieved consistent results in the replication sample. We found the strongest effect at rs757210 in intron 2 of TCF2, with corrected P values &lt;0.01 for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.13. This association was observed again in an independent sample of 5,891 unrelated case and control subjects and 500 families from the U.K., for an overall OR of 1.12 and a P value &lt;10(-6) in &gt;15,000 samples. We combined these results with our previous studies on HNF4alpha and TCF1 and explicitly tested for gene-gene interactions among these variants and with several known type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci, and we found no genetic interactions between these six genes. We conclude that although rare variants in these six genes explain most cases of MODY, common variants in these same genes contribute very modestly, if at all, to the common form of type 2 diabetes.

17346148|t|Genetics of gestational diabetes mellitus.
17346148|a|About 2-5% of all pregnant women develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during their pregnancies and the prevalence has increased considerably during the last decade. GDM is a heterogeneous disorder that is defined as carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. It is manifested when pancreatic beta cells are no longer able to compensate for the increased insulin resistance during pregnancy, but the pathogenesis of the disease is still largely unknown. GDM is considered to result from interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. Genetic predisposition to GDM has been suggested since GDM clusters in families. Also, women with mutations in MODY (Maturity onset diabetes of the young) genes often present with GDM. In addition, common variants in several candidate genes (e.g. potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J, member 11 [KCNJ11], Glucokinase [GCK], Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha [HNF1A] etc.) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of GDM. Old age, obesity and high fat diet represent some important non-genetic factors. There are several approaches to search for genes predisposing to a polygenic disease like GDM including linkage and association studies, expression profiling and animal models. A combination of several methods is usually necessary. Identification of the underlying genetic causes of GDM will eventually give a better view of the mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Furthermore, it may improve options to possibly prevent GDM and complications for the mother and her child. This review focuses on the genetics of GDM and possible implications in clinical practice.

17937063|t|Four novel mutations, including the first gross deletion in TCF1, identified in HNF-4alpha, GCK and TCF1 in patients with MODY in Israel.
17937063|a|Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is characterized by a primary defect in insulin secretion with non-ketotic hyperglycemia, monogenic autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, age at onset less than 25 years, and lack of autoantibodies. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic basis of MODY in different ethnic groups in the Israeli population. Fifty-nine unrelated Israeli patients with MODY were assessed for mutations in the three common MODY genes: hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, glucokinase (GCK), and transcription factor 1 (TCF1). Overall, 11 mutations in 12 unrelated families were found (20.3% of patients), for a relative frequency of 1.7% for MODY1, 8.5% for MODY2, and 10.1% for MODY3. Four mutations were novel, including the first gross deletion ever described in the TCF1 gene. The low overall mutation frequency found here may suggest the involvement of other, yet unidentified, genes in the etiology of MODY in Israel.

18003757|t|The type and the position of HNF1A mutation modulate age at diagnosis of diabetes in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-3.
18003757|a|OBJECTIVE: The clinical expression of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-3 is highly variable. This may be due to environmental and/or genetic factors, including molecular characteristics of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) gene mutation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the mutations identified in 356 unrelated MODY3 patients, including 118 novel mutations, and searched for correlations between the genotype and age at diagnosis of diabetes. RESULTS: Missense mutations prevailed in the dimerization and DNA-binding domains (74%), while truncating mutations were predominant in the transactivation domain (62%). The majority (83%) of the mutations were located in exons 1- 6, thus affecting the three HNF1A isoforms. Age at diagnosis of diabetes was lower in patients with truncating mutations than in those with missense mutations (18 vs. 22 years, P = 0.005). Missense mutations affecting the dimerization/DNA-binding domains were associated with a lower age at diagnosis than those affecting the transactivation domain (20 vs. 30 years, P = 10(-4)). Patients with missense mutations affecting the three isoforms were younger at diagnosis than those with missense mutations involving one or two isoforms (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that part of the variability of the clinical expression in MODY3 patients may be explained by the type and the location of HNF1A mutations. These findings should be considered in studies for the search of additional modifier genetic factors.

18221440|t|Triple diabetes: coexistence of type 1 diabetes mellitus and a novel mutation in the gene responsible for MODY3 in an overweight adolescent.
18221440|a|We report an interesting and unique case of an overweight adolescent with a novel mutation of the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)3 gene [hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1alpha)] and positive islet cell autoantibodies. The patient is a 17-yr-old Caucasian female, who was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treated with metformin and glipizide, with poor control for 18 months prior to being referred to the Endocrinology clinic. Family history was strongly positive for type 2 diabetes (father, paternal aunts, uncles, and grandmother). All were diagnosed at age 40-50 and treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient's body mass index was 36.4 kg/m(2). She had no acanthosis nigricans. Initial hemoglobin A1c was 11.9%, with fasting glucose of 234 mg/dL and fasting insulin 10.7 microU/mL. She was started on insulin therapy (0.6 units/kg/d), resulting in good glycemic control. Oral hypoglycemic agents were discontinued. Immunologic studies showed positive islet cell (29 U/mL, normal &lt;1.0) and glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (0.9 U/mL, normal &lt;0.5) antibodies. Sequencing for HNF-1alpha gene revealed a nucleotide A to G substitution (ACC to GCC), resulting in a missense mutation, T196A. To our knowledge, T196A has not been previously reported. The coexistence of type 1 diabetes autoimmunity and a mutation in the gene responsible for MODY3 in this overweight patient is intriguing and might explain the early onset of progressive insulinopenia compared with the later age of diabetes onset of the earlier generation in the family.

18297260|t|Best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
18297260|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the GCK and HNF1A genes are the most common cause of the monogenic forms of diabetes known as 'maturity-onset diabetes of the young'. GCK encodes the glucokinase enzyme, which acts as the pancreatic glucose sensor, and mutations result in stable, mild fasting hyperglycaemia. A progressive insulin secretory defect is seen in patients with mutations in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha and -4 alpha. A molecular genetic diagnosis often changes management, since patients with GCK mutations rarely require pharmacological treatment and HNF1A/4A mutation carriers are sensitive to sulfonylureas. These monogenic forms of diabetes are often misdiagnosed as type 1 or 2 diabetes. Best practice guidelines for genetic testing were developed to guide testing and reporting of results. METHODS: A workshop was held to discuss clinical criteria for testing and the interpretation of molecular genetic test results. The participants included 22 clinicians and scientists from 13 countries. Draft best practice guidelines were formulated and edited using an online tool (http://www.coventi.com). RESULTS: An agreed set of clinical criteria were defined for the testing of babies, children and adults for GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A mutations. Reporting scenarios were discussed and consensus statements produced. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Best practice guidelines have been established for monogenic forms of diabetes caused by mutations in the GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A genes. The guidelines include both diagnostic and predictive genetic tests and interpretation of the results.

18390429|a|Ketoacidotic coma is one of the possible diabetes mellitus first symptoms. It results from complete or relative lack of insuline and is often associated with type 1 diabetes. The authors report a case of a 45-years old woman with inaugural diabetes of which atypical features have motivated the study of MODY gene (maturity-onset diabetes of the young). Gly574ser polymorphism in the HNF-1alpha gene was found, in homozygous state, and the question of the responsibility of this polymorphism in this diabete is asked.

18391435|t|Crystallization of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha) in complex with the HNF1 alpha promoter element.
18391435|a|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that plays a central role in organ development and metabolic functions. Mutations on HNF4alpha cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a dominant monogenic cause of diabetes. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of promoter recognition and the molecular basis of disease-causing mutations, the recombinant HNF4alpha DNA-binding domain was prepared and used in a study of its binding properties and in crystallization with a 21-mer DNA fragment that contains the promoter element of another MODY gene, HNF1alpha. The HNF4alpha protein displays a cooperative and specific DNA-binding activity towards its target gene-recognition elements. Crystals of the complex diffract to 2.0 A using a synchrotron-radiation source under cryogenic (100 K) conditions and belong to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 121.63, b = 35.43, c = 70.99 A, beta = 119.36 degrees . A molecular-replacement solution has been obtained and structure refinement is in progress. This structure and the binding studies will provide the groundwork for detailed functional and biochemical studies of the MODY mutants.

18492944|t|Clinical application of 1,5-anhydroglucitol measurements in patients with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
18492944|a|OBJECTIVE: 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a short-term marker of metabolic control in diabetes. Its renal loss is stimulated in hyperglycemic conditions by glycosuria, which results in a lowered plasma concentration. As a low renal threshold for glucose has been described in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), the 1,5-AG level may be altered in these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the 1,5-AG levels in patients with HNF-1alpha MODY and in type 2 diabetic subjects with a similar degree of metabolic control. In addition, we aimed to evaluate this particle as a biomarker for HNF-1alpha MODY. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 33 diabetic patients from the Polish Nationwide Registry of MODY. In addition, we examined 43 type 2 diabetic patients and 47 nondiabetic control subjects. The 1,5-AG concentration was measured with an enzymatic assay (GlycoMark). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate 1,5-AG as a screening marker for HNF-1alpha MODY. RESULTS: The mean 1,5-AG plasma concentration in diabetic HNF-1alpha mutation carriers was 5.9 microg/ml, and it was lower than that in type 2 diabetic patients (11.0 microg/ml, P = 0.003) and in nondiabetic control subjects (23.9 microg/ml, P &lt; 0.00005). The ROC curve analysis revealed 85.7% sensitivity and 80.0% specificity of 1,5-AG in screening for HNF-1alpha MODY at the criterion of &lt;6.5 microg/ml in patients with an A1C level between 6.5 and 9.0%. CONCLUSIONS: 1,5-AG may be a useful biomarker for differential diagnosis of patients with HNF-1alpha MODY with a specific range of A1C, although this requires further investigation. However, the clinical use of this particle in diabetic HNF-1alpha mutation carriers for metabolic control has substantial limitations.

18513302|t|Can complement factors 5 and 8 and transthyretin be used as biomarkers for MODY 1 (HNF4A-MODY) and MODY 3 (HNF1A-MODY)?
18513302|a|AIMS: Genetic testing is needed for the formal diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), but this is not widely available. If any MODY biomarkers were known, these could possibly be used as an alternative. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha regulate transcription of genes encoding complement 5 (C5), complement 8 (C8) and transthyretin (TTR), suggesting that these could be potential biomarkers for the disease. We therefore set out to determine whether serum concentrations of C5, C8 and TTR can be used as biomarkers for patients with HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY. METHODS: The serum concentrations of C5, C8 and TTR were analysed in patients with mutations in the HNF-1alpha (n=29) and HNF-4alpha (N=13) genes. Type 2 diabetic (n = 14) and healthy subjects (n = 20), matched for body mass index (BMI), served as diabetic and non-diabetic control groups, respectively. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic patients had markedly increased levels of C5 and C8 compared with healthy control subjects. Levels of C5 and C8 correlated with glycated haemoglobin (C5: r = 0.48, P = 0.019). After adjustment for BMI, glycated haemoglobin, age and gender, HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A patients had reduced levels of C5 and C8 compared with Type 2 diabetic patients (C5: P = 0.001; C8: P = 0.004). In addition, patients with HNF4A-MODY, but not those with HNF1A-MODY, had decreased TTR compared with diabetic patients (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of C5 and C8 seem to distinguish HNF4A and HNF1A-MODY from other forms of diabetes. However, hyperglycaemia per se increases the serum concentrations, thereby attenuating their potential role as biomarkers for MODY.

18513305|a|AIMS: Previous reports have indicated that maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) caused by hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF1A) mutations (MODY3) is the most common MODY subtype in Northern Europe, but population-based prevalence estimates are lacking. We sought to determine the prevalence of HNF1A-MODY in diabetic subjects of a defined Norwegian population (the HUNT2 Study). METHODS: Of the 1972 diabetic HUNT2 subjects, we identified a subgroup of 43 suspected MODY cases based on information on family history, disease onset and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody status. These cases were considered a discovery group for HNF1A mutations and underwent full DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the entire cohort of diabetic HUNT2 subjects was screened for three selected HNF1A mutations. Possible founder effects were examined using the Norwegian MODY Registry. RESULTS: Three subjects from the discovery group harboured HNF1A mutations. Two subjects had the previously described R229Q mutation, one had a novel S6N alteration, whereas the HNF1A hot-spot mutation P291fsinsC was not identified. Genotyping the cohort of diabetic HUNT2 subjects identified five additional R229Q-positive subjects. Microsatellite analysis performed for all R229Q-positive probands of the Norwegian MODY Registry and those found in the HUNT2 population revealed that 17 of 18 (94%) had genotypes consistent with a common haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical MODY criteria were fulfilled in 2.2% of diabetic HUNT2 subjects. The minimum prevalence of HNF1A-MODY among diabetic HUNT2 subjects was 0.4%. Because of founder effects, registry-based prevalence studies probably need to be very large and they should also include prospectively collected phenotypes and extensive mutation screening to establish the true prevalence of MODY.

18586913|t|Diabetes susceptibility in the Canadian Oji-Cree population is moderated by abnormal mRNA processing of HNF1A G319S transcripts.
18586913|a|OBJECTIVE: The G319S HNF1A variant is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the Canadian Oji-Cree population. We hypothesized that the variant site at the 3' end of exon 4 might influence splicing and characterized mRNA transcripts to investigate the mutational mechanism underlying this susceptibility to diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We established lymphoblastoid cell lines from a G319S homozygote and controls. HNF1A transcripts were characterized in the cell lines and pancreatic tissue by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products and quantification using real-time PCR. Susceptibility to mRNA surveillance was investigated using cycloheximide. RESULTS: Full-length G319S mRNA accounted for 24% of mRNA transcripts in the homozygous G319S cell line. A novel isoform lacking the terminal 12 bases of exon 4 was upregulated (55% of mRNA transcripts) compared with control cell lines (33%) and human pancreatic tissue (17%). Two abnormal transcripts present only in the G319S cell line included premature termination codons as a result of the inclusion of seven nucleotides from intron 4 or the deletion of exon 8. Cycloheximide treatment increased the levels of both transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: The G319S variant results in the production of two abnormal transcripts and an alteration in the relative balance of normal splicing products. This is predicted to lead to a reduction in total HNF1A transcript levels, but residual hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha protein activity in G319S homozygotes may still reach up to 66% of normal levels. A combination of abnormal splicing and reduced activity of the G319S protein may explain the diabetes susceptibility.

18697801|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding element within the promoter of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) gene is crucial for MTTP basal expression and insulin responsiveness.
18697801|a|Insulin inhibits the transcription of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), which plays a pivotal role in lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Here, we provide evidence that a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding element (HNF1A element) within the MTTP promoter serves as a novel negative insulin-responsive element. Deletion/mutation mapping of the MTTP gene promoter identified a modified HNF1A element that is crucial to the negative insulin effect. Chimeric promoter containing this HNF1A element and minimal TEAD1 promoter also responded negatively toward insulin treatment. Gel shift assay demonstrated that HNF1A but not HNF1B binds to this element. Enforced expression of HNF1A was sufficient to reconstitute the negative insulin responsiveness of MTTP promoter in TM4SF1 myocytes that are HNF1A negative. Furthermore, replacing this element with consensus HNF1A element preserved the negative insulin response, suggesting that negative insulin responsiveness is a generic characteristic of HNF1A element. Given that many genes implicated in diabetes contain HNF1A element, the potential regulation of these genes by insulin via HNF1A element may provide important clues for the manifestation and treatment of diabetic metabolic syndromes.

18838325|t|Molecular background and clinical characteristics of HNF1A MODY in a Polish population.
18838325|a|PURPOSE: Knowing the molecular background of monogenic diabetes in affected individuals influences the clinical practice. Mutations in the HNF1A gene are the most frequent cause of MODY. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic and clinical characteristics of HNF1A MODY in a Polish population, and the prevalence of diabetic complications and renal malformations. METHODS: We identified 47 families with the early-onset, autosomal-dominant form of diabetes that met the criteria of MODY. Mutation screening involved direct sequencing of the HNF1A gene. Patients' characteristics included clinical data, anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters. The search for renal malformations involved ultrasound examination of all HNF1A mutation carriers. RESULTS: We identified 13 HNF1A MODY families and examined 56 mutation carriers, including 46 diabetic patients. The average HbA(1c) level among the diabetics was 7.5%. We identified diabetic retinopathy in 47.7% of the MODY patients, while diabetic nephropathy was present in 25%. In five HNF1A mutation carriers from three families, renal developmental malformations were identified, including one functioning kidney in two (3.6%) of them. CONCLUSION: This first systematic search for HNF1A mutations in a Polish population revealed that they are a frequent cause of MODY. In this population, HNF1A mutation carriers were characterized by a high prevalence of diabetic complications. In addition, renal developmental abnormalities were found in some mutation carriers.

18949455|t|Early loss of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling and reduction in cell size during dominant-negative suppression of hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A) function in INS-1 insulinoma cells.
18949455|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the HNF1A (previously known as TCF1) gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1A) lead to the development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 3 (HNF1A-MODY), characterised by impaired insulin secretion and a reduction in beta cell mass. HNF1A plays an important role in pancreatic beta cell differentiation and survival. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central growth factor- and nutrient-activated protein kinase controlling cell metabolism, growth and survival. We investigated the role of mTOR inactivation in the decline in beta cell mass in a cellular model of HNF1A-MODY. METHODS: Previously we showed that suppression of HNF1A function via expression of a dominant-negative mutant (DN-HNF1A) decreases insulin gene transcription in insulinoma (INS-1) cells. We investigated the signalling of two distinct mTOR protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, in response to DN-HNF1A induction. RESULTS: We observed delayed inactivation of mTORC2 48 h after DN-HNF1A induction, evidenced by a reduction in serine 473 phosphorylation of thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (AKT1). We also observed an early inactivation of mTORC1 24 h after DN-HNF1A induction, which was detected by decreases in threonine 389 phosphorylation of p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) and serine 65 phosphorylation of translational inhibitor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis demonstrated a pre-apoptotic decrease in INS-1 cell size in response to DN-HNF1A induction, and an increase in the level of the mTORC1-regulated cell-cycle inhibitor, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B p27. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that mTOR kinase and signalling through mTORC1 are highly sensitive to suppression of HNF1A function, and may contribute to disturbance of cell-size regulation and cell-cycle progression in HNF1A-MODY.

19119252|t|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha mutation in normal glucose-tolerant subjects and early-onset type 2 diabetic patients.
19119252|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of diabetes in Korea is reported to be approximately 10%, but cases of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are rare in Korea. A diagnostic technique for autosomal dominant MODY is being actively sought. In this regard, we used a DNA chip to investigate the frequency of mutations of the MODY3 gene (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha) in Korean patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The genomic DNA of 30 normal individuals [age, 24.9+/-8.6 years] and 25 patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (age, 27+/-5.9 years) was extracted, and the MODY3 gene was amplified. The amplified DNA was hybridized onto a MODY3 chip, which has oligonucleotides of 15-25 bases, representing wild-type and mutant MODY3 sequences in both forward and reverse orientations, immobilized on its surface. RESULTS: Among the normal subjects, there was no mutation of MODY3. Among those with early-onset type 2 diabetes, there was one case of MODY3 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that MODY3 mutations are not rare in Korean early-onset type 2 diabetes patients in Korea and suggest that MODY3 mutations in patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes need to be further evaluated.

19228875|t|A-beta-subtype of ketosis-prone diabetes is not predominantly a monogenic diabetic syndrome.
19228875|a|OBJECTIVE: Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is an emerging syndrome that encompasses several distinct phenotypic subgroups that share a predisposition to diabetic ketoacidosis. We investigated whether the A-beta- subgroup of KPD, characterized by complete insulin dependence, absent beta-cell functional reserve, lack of islet cell autoantibodies, and strong family history of type 2 diabetes, represents a monogenic form of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Over 8 years, 37 patients with an A-beta- phenotype were identified in our longitudinally followed cohort of KPD patients. Seven genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), glucokinase (GCK), HNF1A, pancreas duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), HNF1B, neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), and PAX4, were directly sequenced in all patients. Selected gene regions were also sequenced in healthy, unrelated ethnically matched control subjects, consisting of 84 African American, 96 Caucasian, and 95 Hispanic subjects. RESULTS: The majority (70%) of the A-beta- KPD patients had no significant causal polymorphisms in either the proximal promoter or coding regions of the seven genes. The combination of six potentially significant low-frequency, heterozygous sequence variants in HNF-1 alpha (A174V or G574S), PDX1 (putative 5'-untranslated region CCAAT box, P33T, or P239Q), or PAX4 (R133W) were found in 27% (10/37) of patients, with one additional patient revealing two variants, PDX1 P33T and PAX4 R133W. The A174V variant has not been previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its well-circumscribed, robust, and distinctive phenotype of severe, nonautoimmune-mediated beta-cell dysfunction, A-beta- KPD is most likely not a predominantly monogenic diabetic syndrome. Several A-beta- KPD patients have low-frequency variants in HNF1A, PDX1, or PAX4 genes, which may be of functional significance in their pathophysiology.

19309449|t|Mild fasting hyperglycemia in children: high rate of glucokinase mutations and some risk of developing type 1 diabetes mellitus.
19309449|a|BACKGROUND: Incidental hyperglycemia in children generates concern about the presence of preclinical type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). OBJECTIVE: To genetically evaluate two common forms of maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY), the short-term prognosis in children with mild hyperglycemia, and a positive family history of diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS: Asymptomatic children and adolescents (n = 14), younger than 15 yr, with fasting hyperglycemia, a positive family history of mild non-progressive hyperglycemia, and negative pancreatic autoantibodies were studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Glucokinase gene (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha gene (HNF1A) causing two common forms of MODY were sequenced. The clinical outcome was evaluated after a follow-up period of 2.8 +/- 1.3 yr. RESULTS: GCK mutations were present in seven children. The confirmation of this diagnosis allowed discontinuation of insulin in two families and oral medications in three families. Mutations of HNF1A were not detected in any of the families. During the follow-up period, all the GCK mutation carrier children remained asymptomatic without medication and the last hemoglobin A1c levels were 6.4 +/- 0.7%. In the GCK-negative children (n = 7), one developed T1DM, corresponding to 7.2% of the total group. Mild fasting hyperglycemia persisted during follow-up in four GCK-negative children and normalized in the remaining two. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mild persistent hyperglycemia in any patient without autoantibodies should lead to genetic analysis of GCK, particularly if there is a positive family history. Furthermore, those without GCK mutations should be followed with repeat autoantibody testing, and other genetic types of diabetes should be considered if hyperglycemia worsens.

19336507|t|Identification of novel variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in South Indian patients with maturity onset diabetes of young.
19336507|a|CONTEXT: Mutations in the HNF 1A gene are the most common cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in most populations. India currently has the largest number of people with diabetes in the world, and onset of type 2 diabetes occurs at a younger age with possible overlap with MODY. There are very few data on MODY mutations from India. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to screen coding and promoter regions of HNF1A gene for mutations in unrelated South Indian subjects in whom a clinical diagnosis of MODY was made. DESIGN: This was an observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a diabetes specialties centre in Chennai in southern India. PATIENTS: Ninety-six unrelated south Indian subjects in whom clinical diagnosis of MODY was made were included in the study. The control population comprised of 57 unrelated nondiabetic subjects selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study, a study conducted on a representative population (aged &gt; or =20 yr) of Chennai. RESULTS: We identified nine novel variants comprising seven mutations (one novel mutation -538G&gt;C at promoter region and six novel coding region mutations) and two polymorphisms in the HNF1A gene. Functional studies revealed reduced transcriptional activity of the HNF1A promoter for two promoter variants. We also observed cosegregation with diabetes of the Arg263His coding region mutation in eight members of one MODY family, whereas it was absent in nondiabetic subjects of this family. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mutations in the HNF1A gene comprise about 9% of clinically diagnosed MODY subjects in southern India and a novel Arg263His mutation cosegregates with MODY in one family.

19388975|t|A genetic diagnosis of HNF1A diabetes alters treatment and improves glycaemic control in the majority of insulin-treated patients.
19388975|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A) gene mutations are the commonest cause of monogenic diabetes, but patients are often misdiagnosed as having Type 1 diabetes and started on insulin treatment. Patients with HNF1A diabetes are particularly sensitive to the glucose-lowering effect of sulphonylureas, which are the pharmacological treatment of choice. We aimed to assess if patients do change from insulin to sulphonylurea treatment when HNF1A diabetes is confirmed and the impact of this treatment change on long-term glycaemic control. METHODS: We investigated the clinical course of 43 patients who were insulin treated from diagnosis for a median 4 years (range 1-14) before an HNF1A gene mutation was identified. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (79%) stopped insulin following genetic testing and transferred to sulphonylureas. Twenty-four of them (71%) remained off insulin at a median 39 months (range 17-90) post-transfer. The 10 patients who recommenced insulin had a trend towards a longer duration of diabetes (18 vs. 7 years, P = 0.066) compared with those remaining on tablets. The median glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was good (6.9%; interquartile range 6.3-8.0%) in the patients who remained off insulin and 19/24 patients (79%) achieved HbA(1c) &lt; 7.5% or improved their pre-genetic diagnosis HbA(1c) by &gt; 1.0%. Transfer off insulin was not attempted in eight patients: one of these was planning pregnancy and two chose to remain on insulin. CONCLUSION: In this observational study we found that a molecular genetic diagnosis of HNF1A diabetes does alter treatment in clinical practice, with 79% attempting transfer to sulphonylureas. Transfer to sulphonylureas was successful in the majority of patients without deterioration in glycaemic control.

19417042|t|Expanded clinical spectrum in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b-maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
19417042|a|AIMS: HNF1B-maturity-onset diabetes of the young is caused by abnormalities in the HNF1B gene encoding the transcription factor HNF-1beta. We aimed to investigate detailed clinical features and the type of HNF1B gene anomaly in five pediatric cases with HNF1B-MODY. METHODS: From a cohort of 995 children and adolescents with diabetes, we analyzed the most frequent maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A) including HNF1B sequencing and deletion analysis by quantitative Multiplex-PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments (QMPSF) if patients were islet autoantibody-negative and had one parent with diabetes or associated extrapancreatic features or detectable C-peptide outside honeymoon phase. Presence and size of disease-causing chromosomal rearrangements detected by QMPSF were further analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: Overall, five patients had a heterozygous HNF1B deletion, presenting renal disease, elevated liver enzymes, and diabetes. Diabetes was characterized by insulin resistance and adolescent onset of hyperglycemia. Additionally, clinical features in some patients were pancreas dysplasia and exocrine insufficiency (two of five patients), genital defects (three of five), mental retardation (two of five), and eye abnormalities (coloboma, cataract in two of five). One case also had severe growth deficit combined with congenital cholestasis, and another case had common variable immune deficiency. All patients reported here had monoallelic loss of the entire HNF1B gene. Whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed a precurrent genomic deletion of approximately 1.3-1.7 Mb in size. CONCLUSION: The clinical data of our cases enlarge the wide spectrum of patients with HNF1B anomaly. The underlying molecular defect in all cases was a 1.3- to 1.7-Mb deletion, and paired, segmental duplications along with breakpoints were most likely involved in this recurrent chromosomal microdeletion.

19490620|t|HNF1A gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with late-onset autosomal dominant diabetes: a cross-sectional study.
19490620|a|BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 homeobox A (HNF1A) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) playing a minor role in its pathogenesis. HNF1A is a frequent cause of monogenic diabetes, albeit with early-onset. Some uncommon subgroups like late-onset autosomal dominant diabetes mellitus (LOADDM) may present peculiar inheritance patterns with a stronger familial component. This study aims to investigate the relationship of HNF1A SNPs with cardiovascular risk factors in this group, as well as to characterize them in contrast with classical T2DM (CT2DM). METHODS: eighteen LOADDM (age at onset &gt; 40 y.o.; diabetes in 3 contiguous generations, uniparental lineage) along with 48 CT2DM patients and 42 normoglycemic controls (N group) have been evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors and SNPs of HNF1A. RESULTS: LOADDM showed significantly higher frequencies of SNPs A98V (22.2% vs 2.1%, p = 0.02) and S487N (72.2% vs 43.8%, p = 0.049) of HNF1A compared to CT2DM. I27L did not show significant difference (66.7% vs 45.8%), but associated with lower risk of hypertriglyceridemia (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.65, p = 0.01). "Protective effect" was independent from other well-known predictive risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia, such as waist circumference (OR 1.09 per 1 cm increase, p = 0.01) and HDL (OR 0.01 per 1 mmol/l, p = 0.005), after logistic regression. CONCLUSION: Late onset autosomal dominant diabetes mellitus is clinically indistinguishable from classical type 2 diabetes individuals. However, LOADDM group is enriched for common HNF1A polymorphisms A98V and S487N. I27L showed "protective effect" upon hypertriglyceridemia in this sample of individuals, suggesting a role for HNF1A on diabetic individuals' lipid profile. These data contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions between genes, hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors development in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
